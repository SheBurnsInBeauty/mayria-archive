as “a professional reader of pain” (“How to Read,” 139). In The Body in Pain, Scarry shares this unease with the imprecision of interpretation. When she writes about pain, she narrows her focus to the capacity of language to repre- sent the material world—to name objects—eschewing a more complex view of language that includes its social and creative functions. Language about pain fails, in her view, because it cannot identify its object and thus it cannot confer a verifiable reality upon an internal experience. Like physicians, Scarry wants language to name and validate what is real and true. For both, this desire cre- ates the conditions for doubt and indifference. It is also the case, however, that in the second half of The Body in Pain, Scarry complicates her original assertions and describes the paths by which pain, “this most radically private of experiences,” enters cultur…

merely the physical expression of the more pure, more ethereal "datafied" human. Science may someday prove this incontrovertibly. But it is the visceral human that the post- human has yet to address. When we strip away all layers of technology, all ob- jects that came to be through human artifice, we are left only with the human. Thus we must return to the human, and the human's most basic wants and needs, in order to understand the posthuman. Elaine Scarry: Reconfiguring the Embrace To understand the deeper implications of "embodiment" in light of posthuman- ism, we turn to Elaine Scany's The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World. In her book, Scany centers the defining characteristic of humanity in the way in which human beings experience and express physical pain. Scany's

body, which has been read by traditional philosophy as mere and brute matter, remains to be thought. Here, bodies are no longer assumed simply to be given in and to the world but are rather understood as both the locus of thinking – the site from which thinking takes place – and as the object of thought – as being already subject to interpretation and conceptualisation. As Elaine Scarry has shown in The Body in Pain, the interfaces between bodies and their worlds are made and unmade through social practices, the pain of which may shatter language and defy its representational potential (1985: 5). Thus the practices of thinking are not separated from the realm of the body but are implicated in the passion, emotions and materiality that are associated with lived embodiment. The task of Thinking Through the Skin is, at one level, to continue the feminist project of taking bodies seriously as both the subject and object of thinking.

ferent names and regard as desirable. To this number must be added the vast legions for which pain is such an inescapable dimension of daily life that it excites no particular response and indeed scarcely has a name. Not feeling their pain at all, Scarry treats as an immediate and monochrome physical experience, a baseline of reality, what is in fact a combination of sensations, dispositions, cultural circumstances, and explanations, a phenomenon involving body, mind, and culture. She has, in other words, misconceived the character of pain precisely by giving it a character, by treating it as a fact—a brute fact, the first and final fact—rather than as an interpretation. So rhetorically or internally filigreed, Scarry’s thoughts on pain, as on torture and war, are, when matched against the things them- selves, strikingly undeveloped.11 To understand the “internal” significance, the placement, of pain in

of an article she has read on a number of occasions; the concept of “work,” subsequently elaborated in an essay on Hardy in Resisting Representation, dominates Chapter 3, as does “imagination”; and the emphasis throughout The Body in Pain, but especially in Chapter 4, on bodiliness and materiality reappears in her work in Literature and the Body.7 An essay from the early 1990s on “The Difficulty of Imagining Other People” takes as evidence for this difficulty the human willingness to inflict pain.8 If, a generation later, Scarry remains the author of The Body in Pain, it is because this great and strange book constitutes the first, and often the most productive account of subjects that have occupied her ever since. The appearance in 1985 of The Body in Pain constituted one of the most stunning academic debuts in memory; the book remains today one of the most formidable, ambitious, and original works to have been produced

Introduction 9 discussion visual and performative representations of embodied pain, using an insistently dialectical approach that takes into account the perspective of the hurt body itself, the power and afflictions of its beholder and, finally, the routinising and redeeming of hurt within institutional contexts. The account that has resulted from the outlined desiderata will lead the reader through the fields of literary studies, art history, theatre studies, cul- tural history and the study of emotions, and as a result it does not represent a neat historical arc. However, all contributions are united by their concen- tration on two bodies: that of the beholder and that of the victim/performer. To unite these two, the chapters engage the spaces, ritual framings, and mediating agents that prepared, maintained, and were affected by the estab- lishment of relations of performing the victim and viewing the affliction, and

We must keep in mind that, for Scarry, both the recognition and the expression of pain necessarily involve empathetic identifi- cation with the suffering body. If empathy is absent, then what has been repre- sented (or apprehended) is not pain but something else. The power, the immediacy, and the factual certainty of pain have been used to substantiate (to make “real,” “immediate,” “certain,” etc.) a cultural construct that would oth- erwise lack credibility. 10.

causes, namely, the impression that my pain emanates from the burn; the self- perception of the panic of my libidinal tensions; the revival of immemorial pain; the mobilization of all of my forces on the mental representation of the injured arm; and, finally, the isolation of this representation. The representation of the wounded and painful part of the body Let us emphasize that such a connection of causes inducing corporeal pain evokes that which presides at the formation of the psychical pain. We see that the logical schemas accounting for these two forms of pain are almost identical. However, one of their differences resides in the imaginary contents of the hypertrophic representation.14 Indeed, while for corporeal pain the rep- resentation refers to a wounded body, psychical pain refers to an object that has been loved and lost (a person, a thing, or a value). We will address at le…

are oversimplified and decontextualized in idealistic arguments about how lit- erature serves civil society. If one believes social emotions must be grounded in certainty or that particular emotions, such as love or empathy, necessarily lead to ethical action, one will often be disappointed. But Das’s discussion of Manto’s story suggests that acknowledgment, compassion, and love, like all acts of inter- pretation, are vulnerable to error, ignorance, and indeterminacy. And yet, she shows they are also fundamentally necessary in embodied and social life. While Das appears to have traveled far from Scarry’s The Body in Pain, her analysis of the limits and possibilities of language about pain ultimately builds in productive ways on Scarry’s critical legacy. Like Scarry, Das acknowledges that pain can reduce the human voice to a wordless cry. Like Scarry, she also sees that pain motiv…

14 BODIES IN PAIN affective consequences for the spectator. For me, one of the most important themes in his work is the notion of ‘bodies in pain’ as theorized by Elaine Scarry (1985). Therefore, one of the goals of this book is to investigate how such pain is directly ‘transmitted’ to the spectator, as a phenomenon that is simultaneously a sensation and an emotion (Jackson 1994: 201). For many philosophers of pain, the state of pain disrupts the intentionality of the body; even more keenly, pain disrupts the relationship between the lived-body and the world. In pain, one may experience one’s body as an ‘alien presence’ (Leder 1990: 73) because it appears as strange, or ‘other’, to one, becoming an object instead of a subject of experience. While in normal circumstances the body is the locus from which one directs one’s attention to the world, in pain the body becomes an objec…

These witness survivors ﬁgure the human as an ethical category that maintains difference while laying claim to the universal, and as such, they give us a new critical and theo- retical language for negotiating these various concerns of legal, theoret- ical, and aesthetic thought. Body of Atrocity: Body of Humanity Elaine Scarry, in her groundbreaking The Body in Pain, undertook an ambitious project to intervene broadly, through critical analysis, into one of the most pervasive, hidden, and destructive forms of state vio- lence—that of torture. Her book, which utilizes testimonial accounts by torture survivors, documents by Amnesty International (AI), literary and philosophical approaches to language, consciousness, and pain, and medical studies, is a broad and detailed analysis of the role pain plays in the d…

as Elaine Scarry was to point out, almost always intro­ duces the terminology of the weapon: it’s “as though a knife was being twisted into me”, “as though a hammer was shattering me”, “as though someone was stabbing me”, etc. In her study of the lexicon of pain, Scarry argues that there are basically only two metaphors that appear here: that of the weapon and that of the wound, as if pain is represented either via the image of its agent or as bodily damage itself: it’s “as though my bone was sticking out of my arm”, “as though my chest is on fire”, “as though my stomach had a hole in it”, etc.48 Doesn’t this bifurcation in fact also echo the relation of frustration to privation?

Self-Mutilation and (a)signification 95 with which masochism has been greeted in many areas of theory. If pain is to be sought, it must be in the context of an end point, a desired outcome such as a tattoo or piercing; the pain itself is seen as a necessary horror to be endured. A wilful inversion of Scarry’s thesis in the unsurpassed The Body in Pain is instructive in elaborating on the relationship between pain and the generation of meaning. Scarry’s starting point is a concern with how physical suffering may structure the subject’s experience of the world around them and their position within it as subject or otherwise. One of her most vital claims is that physical pain carries with it the ability to ‘utterly nullify the claims of the world’ or to ‘unmake’ the world (Scarry 1985: 33). The attention and perspective of the subject in pain shrinks inward from the expanse of the…

ing’ (19). Acute pain is open to narration by witnesses, advocates, torturers, or theorists—all of whom may separate that pain, through representation, from the suffering body itself (one of Scarry’s arguments). If the nonparticipatory anesthetized patient is in many ways more convenient for the surgeon, the in- articulate sufferer is so for the theorist” (132). Although Holmes seems to be on the verge of rejecting much of what Scarry says in The Body in Pain, she is instead inspired to reread the book. She finds things there she had overlooked, such as an acknowledgment that chronic pain is distinct from the acute pain of torture. “Perhaps the fault is not in The Body in Pain,” Holmes suggests, “but in how we have tended to read it”: “Drawn to the keen lines of acute pain and the attractions of the unmaking of the world, we have bypassed the places in the text where the world …

of the spectator. I do not wish to suggest that there is some common denominator of pain that functions as a vehicle between the cinematic and the authentic lived ex- perience. As Scarry points out: ‘[W]hatever pain achieves, it achieves in part through its unsharability, and it ensures this unsharability through its resis- tance to language. . . . Physical pain [brings] about an immediate reversion to a state anterior to language, to the sounds and cries a human being makes be- fore language is learned’ (Scarry 1985: 4).9 But this does not necessarily mean that pain cannot be represented, or that one cannot understand its effects, if not the experience, when not physically in pain. In pain the body ‘speaks’ through affect, not through language. Furthermore, this does not mean that communication through affect is void of semantic meaning altogether. In this context, Janet Wolff (…

Chapter 4 Writing in Pain: Baudelaire’s Urban Poetics The Body of the City Peter Stallybrass and Allon White have argued that “the body cannot be thought separately from the social formation, symbolic topography and the constitution of the subject. The body is neither a purely natural given nor is it merely a textual metaphor.”1 Elaine Scarry is similarly attentive to what she calls “the socialization of sentience” (BP 255). Locating the body’s capacities and needs at the origin of material culture, Scarry contends that human sentience is inevitably restructured by the very objects it produces. In other words, those objectifications of the body that comprise the made world—from the minutest physical or verbal artifact to that vast collec- tive artifact called “civilization”—return as percepts and concepts to their source in the body, where they reside as the fundamental constituents of…

Yet another element of Scarry’s philosophy of pain is the ‘pure experience of negation’. In the experience of pain there is often the immediate feeling that something external is directed against one, even though this something is located within oneself. It is identified as ‘not oneself’, as something so alien that it must immediately be disposed of. Simultaneously that same something is internalized in such a way that the person in pain may be dominated by a sense of ‘internal agency’. Thus when a knife enters the body, for instance, one will feel one’s own body, rather than the knife, hurting one (Scarry 1985: 52–53). In the film Black Swan, both ‘modalities of pain’ – external and internal – seem to be operating simultaneously. In this film, protagonist Nina mutilates herself in order to replace her feelings of insecurity with a sense of external control. Rather than being …

tion of subjectivity signals a fundamental change in the everyday object pre- versus post-victimization. Elaine Scarry’s now canonical study The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World established that this new ordering of the material world occurs for the victim during the scene of torture. According to Scarry, before this scene, objects already play a crucial role in the formation of the subject. In the case of the tortured person, such objects are not only changed, but actually participate in the prisoner’s resis- tance, in the reconstitution of a reduced subjectivity, producing Scarry’s re- ordering of the subject’s relationship to the material world, but also giving the object a memorial charge that retains the residual presence of the disap- peared subject.13 This dangerous potentiality posed by the object is palpable in the way in which such everyday items were policed and pillaged during the dictatorship.

distribution. In the long run, we will see that the story of physical pain becomes as well a story about the expansive nature of human sentience, the felt-fact of aliveness that is often sheerly happy, just as the story of expressing physical pain eventually opens into the wider frame of invention.

This book is about the way other persons become yisible to us, or cease to be visible to us. It is about the way we make ourselves (and the originally interior facts of sentience) available to one another through verbal and material artifacts, as it is also about the way the derealization of artifacts may assist in taking away another person's visibility. The title of the book, The Body in Pain, designates as the book'…

Nemo’s ‘book about evil in Job’ in his essay ‘Transcendence and Evil’. 15. Levinas’s thinking may be contrasted to that found in Elaine Scarry’s influ- ential 1980s book, The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985), which is also relevant for the present study. Levinas’s thinking of the suffering of the other does not entail simply a reversal of the analysis found in The Body in Pain (influenced, as the latter is, more by the analytic tradition rather than the continental). This is in the sense that it does not operate in terms of, and therefore merely subvert, the same conceptual field. Nevertheless, there is a striking contrast between the two. For Scarry, while the pain of the other is always susceptible to doubt, denial or disregard, one’s own pain is undeni- ably certain. For Levinas, on the contrary, while one’s own pain can never be fully available as such, experienced without remainder by the conscious-

tural significance, who used physically grotesque visual imagery as a technique of representation. The sixth and final chapter pulls together textual and visual representation by examining the status of the body in the processes of making and unmaking (as always in a religious context) with reference to religious conceptions of the human. Here I suggest how serious consideration of the ambiguity of the body chal- lenges both current conceptions of religion and current views of theo- logical discourse. Approach and Underlying Assumptions This discussion depends in its approach upon the recent work of Elaine Scarry8 and Michael Taussig.9 Each of these thinkers, albeit from different disciplinary perspectives and by means of different methods, argues that the processes of violence and terror mimic the processes of creativity; both draw upon the testimony of others, in- cluding perpetrators,…

Scarry’s focus on the uses of dehumanization in torture and the conflicts of war mean that she frames the loss of language within a highly negative framework, however, taking her discussion of the ‘unmaking of the world’ (which essentially equates to the unmaking of the existing symbolic and social order) in conjunction with Kristeva’s concept of semiotic signification allows for a recasting of the effects of physical pain in an alternative and potentially more revolutionary light. Self-mutilatory acts such as cutting and burning, and the pain that accompanies these acts, may emerge as practices that enable the subject to deconstruct or refuse dominant significatory systems that have left no space for the chora and its fluid, multiple forms of meaning. Simultaneously, it may be used to create new asignifying systems that take place solely on and in the body, an ongoing process…

past twenty years, we must suspend for a moment the impulse to decide between worshippers and denigrators, and try to comprehend them both in a synthetic understanding that attends to the genuine strength, the hyp- notic appeal, the incredible gaps and flaws, and the almost overpowering peculiarity of her writing. So, rather than assessing Scarry’s statements on pain, torture, war, creation, beauty, and imagination by measuring these statements against the things themselves, we will begin by taking Scarry’s work as that sort of thing that excites radically divergent and convinced assessments. Trying to understand why this is so, we will try to infer the features of the mind and sensibility that produced the work, with insight into the subjects she takes up being reserved as a possible byproduct of this approach. We will begin, in other words, by assuming that the deter- minants of Scarry’s texts are internal as well as external, and that these

pain after the 1750S. The literature of sensibility, and by extension Roman- tic fiction, fostered the myth that pain could be shared through the medium of the sympathetic body. Thus pain became a proclamation of ontological presence both for the victim and the spectator of pain; the distinction between them could no longer be said to exist. As Elaine Scarry argues, pain is "so incontestably and unnegotiably present . . . that 'having pain' may

resented – both visually and in narrative – through ‘the wound’ (a bruised or cut skin surface). The wound functions as a trace of where the surface of another entity (however imaginary) has impressed upon the body, an impres- sion that is felt and seen as the violence of negation. It is these moments of intensiﬁcation that deﬁne the contours of the ordi- nary surfaces of bodily dwelling, surfaces that are marked by differences in the very experience of intensities.7 As pain sensations demand that I attend to my embodied existence, then I come to inhabit the surfaces of the world in a particular way. The tingles, pricks and then cramps return me to my body by giving me a sense of the edge or border, a ‘sense’ that is an experi- ence of intensiﬁcation and a departure from what is lived as ordinary. The ordinary is linked in this way to the absence of perception, rather than the absence of the body (see Chapter 8). As Elizabeth Grosz puts it, in the case

this choice: the history of painting contains countless depic­ tions of disembodied heads-think of the head of Christ, for example. This phenomenon, which at first might appear as a simple transposition of castration-the head has been cut off instead of the genitals-has a much deeper significance: it shows us how the very possibility of figuring the human body is inevitably tied to the representation of pain. I found it crucial to highlight this copresence of pain and representation, espe­ cially today, when facing pain has become increasingly difficult; pain is either repressed or exploded into violence and massacre. Representation depends on a more intimate experience of pain, an intimacy that is currently in need of renewal. 133

IO Chapter One our perception of it a dualism: by trying to use the mind to control the pained body, we reinforce the mind's estrangement from the body. And in so dOing, we invoke a complex series of confusions about the way we think about the body. These confusions become particularly acute for the late eighteenth century, in which the pleasurable perception of others' pain was colliding with the distressing perception of one's own odious pain. The dualism that Scarry suggests exists in pain can be read as part of a Romantic dualism of self-perception, one that depends upon nociception at the same time that it tries to eradicate it. I want now to turn to a more linear analysis of the history of nociception and discuss its implications for Romantic modes of thinking about the body. As pain manifests itself at the turn of the nineteenth century, we can ask Eagleton's question…

schean fashion. Spillers explains: These undecipherable markings on the captive body render a kind of hieroglyphics of the flesh whose severe disjunctures come to be hid- den to the cultural seeing by skin color. We might well ask if this phe- nomenon of marking and branding actually “transfers” from one genera- tion to another, finding its vari ous symbolic substitutions in an efficacy of meanings that repeat the initiating moments? As Elaine Scarry de- scribes the mechanisms of torture, these lacerations, woundings, fis- sures, tears, scars, openings, ruptures, lesions, rendings, punctures of the flesh create the distance between what I would designate a cultural vestibularity and the culture, whose state apparatus, including judges, attorneys, “owners,” “soul drivers,” “overseers,” and “men of God,” ap-

perhaps as the by-product of a more personal set of experiences. To conceive of one signifying framework that could account for the numerous sensations and attendant contextual elements (instruments used, accompanying music or locations, clothing to reveal or hide the wounds, and so on) is to remain bound to a repressive and institutionalized schema that seeks to co-opt and control any body that refuses to adhere to the standardized codes of the human. The multiplicity of meanings that surround self-harm, in the social sphere and the realm of personal experience, may be evoked through the scene in The Piano Teacher in which Erika, sitting on the side of the bath, cuts her genitals in a gesture that is presented as a habitual act of mutilation. Furthermore, this scene enacts a dovetailing of self-mutilation and masochism in its emphasis upon a key point of interconnection betwee…

and of the infliction of cruelty upon others; Jewel admits that when Donally tattooed him he was delirious and that only Mrs Green's care saved him from blood poisoning. It is also a reminder that suffering does not valorise pain but repeats the circumstances in which the suffering originated. Whilst Jewel believes that the tattoo on his back is impressive, Mariarme is only reminded of the pain which it must have caused. For her, there is no question of the tattoo's beauty transcending Jewel's suffering even though pain is eroticised. Asking Jewel why he allowed Donally to 'attack him' with the needles (p. 86), she wants to know how much it hurt him (p. 96). Indeed, Mariarme is preoccupied with the imposition of pain upon one person by another. Carter's own retrospective essay, 'People as Pictures', in Nothing Sacred, on the subject of Japanese tattooing, 'irezumi', provides…

6 THE BODY IN PAIN is eliminated. A great deal, then, is at stake in the attempt to invent linguistic structures that will reach and accommodate this area of experience normally so inaccessible to language; the human attempt to reverse the de-objectifying work of pain by forcing pain itself into avenues of objectification is a project laden with practical and ethical consequence. Who are the authors of this attempted reversal, the creators or near-creators of a language for pain? Because the words of five different groups of women and men have been regularly consulted in the preliminary thinking for this book, it will be helpful to name them here, though they together constitute only a very partial list of all those who have entered into the long history of this struggle. First, of course, are individuals who have themselves been in great pain and whose words are later available either because they themselves remember them,

the pain. Henceforth, each time that a sharp screaming strikes the ears of the subject, whether a scream proffered by the other, or a new scream from the subject itself, the pain reappears as a memory in the flesh. By hearing the scream, the subject feels an inexplicable physical pain. The scream is thus not only a figure of pain, it can also be, because it is a memory, an excitation that leads to a painful sensation without an identifiable organic cause. It is as if the sensation was a hallucinated pain. The sequence of our reasoning would be as follows: the scream reflects pain, the scream refracts pain, and then the scream triggers pain. It shows it, marks it, and engenders it as a hal- lucinated production. To read these pages of Freud in light of what Lacan has taught us, we rec- ognize clearly two important articulations. The first is as follows: the relation between the scream and…

that this experience makes way for the imaginative activity “that even- tually brings forth the dense sea of artifacts and symbols that we make and move about in” (162). Indeed, Scarry argues that imagination is the only state that is wholly its objects. There is in imagining no activity, no “state,” no experienceable condition or felt-occurrence separate from the objects: the only evidence that one is “imagining” is that imaginary objects appear in the mind. Thus, while pain is like seeing or desiring but not like seeing x or desiring y, the opposite but equally extraordinary characteristic belongs to imagining. (162) For Scarry, pain and imagination are finally “the ‘framing events’ within whose boundaries all other perceptual, somatic, and emotional events occur; thus, between the two extremes can be mapped the whole terrain of the human psyche” (165). Clarke sees this as well. Repres…

x Preface Unlike philosophers, artists have generally devoted a very adoring, revering attention to the body. Realizing how powerfully and precisely our mental life is displayed through bodily expression, they have shown how the most subtle nuances of belief, desire, and feeling are reﬂected in the postural and gestural attitudes of our ﬁgures and facial countenance. However, in their idolizing love of the human body, artists have usually preferred to portray it as the attractive object of another person’s con- sciousness rather than the radiating expression of the somatic subject’s own probing consciousness of embodied self. Women, particularly young vulnerable women, are the frequent subjects of such objectiﬁcation, por- trayed as lusciously sensuous and obligingly passive ﬂesh for the viewer’s devouring delectation. The artistic yearning to glorify the body’s beauty as desired object often results, moreover, in stylistic exaggerations that

and somehow re-appropriated by the sentient body in a process that is as much individual (personal) as it is social (cultural). Pain therefore needs to be apprehended before it can be corporeally shared; it needs to be given an external image before it can be invested in bodily terms. Once the image of the harmed body is visualised, viewers can apprehend the degree of damage inflicted and calculate its probable effect. If this is a successfully disturbing experience, viewers may recoil at the encounter with their own fragility and capacity for somatic empathy. It is when pain can be objectified and external- ised through Horror that the damaged body is turned into an available expe- rience to be felt alongside fictional characters. This is why pain can be seen, paradoxically, as an empirical catalyst, because it puts viewers back in contact with the body as object. Horror makes …

which is misinterpreted by the brain as pain. However, research and treatments for these theories are unverifiable. Herta Flor is concerned with the link between memory and bodily loss. She suggests that since phantom pain may resemble the pain that occurred before a limb was amputated, “pain memories established prior to the amputation are powerful elicitors of phantom limb pain” (Flor 2002, 877). Though phantom pain usually resembles pre-­amputation pain, Flor explains that her theory remains inconclusive, partially due to the influence of the psychical upon the physical. She concludes that “more longitudinal research is needed to test the pain memory hypothesis” (Flor 2006, 878). Ramachandran’s research on PLS focuses on the neurological reaction to the trauma of an amputated limb. He theorises that a map of the body exists in the brain, which is suddenly mismatched when a…

And our neglected, marginalized organic life, it will be argued here, also finds symbolic expression in the atavistic, demonic images conjured by macabre literature. Body horror, pain, death, and dismemberment are facts of everyday physical life on the one hand and phantoms of our dreams and imagining at the same time. Cancer is a distinct reality in the world, and anxi- ety regarding it constitutes another kind of reality, the reality in which horror literature is situated. Though they intertwine, pain is one thing, the fear of pain another, and fictive dramas of pain yet another. Even the new attention to embodiment and the body evident in contem- porary literary criticism, psychology, and philosophy, however, have not be- gun to bridge the division between thought and the vital dimension of …

as a metaphor for the structure of this book, which is a linguistic reflection upon BIID and the phantom limb syndromes. Psychoanalysis provides a starting point for this exploration because, in the words of Marilia Aisenstein, if psychoanalysis is unique, and irreplaceable, in relation to other forms of psychological treatment, it is so, in my view, because it opens up thought processes and enables the subject to reintegrate into the chain of psychic events even something unthinkable, such as the appearance of a lethal illness. (Aisenstein 2006, 679) Psychoanalysis, therefore, offers new ways of thinking about BIID and PLS, two phenomena that are to a great extent, incomprehensible. This work draws relation- ships between psychoanalysis and the two bodily conditions, which focus on the fractured psyche and soma. By attending to the body, this exploration will illumi- nate what…

that Palmer correctly identifies as necessary when viewing In My Skin is vital for the analysis of the film in this chapter; it indicates that the relationship between film and spectator can be an intersubjective one, in which the spectator is called upon by the film to participate in the act of meaning-making. Here, In My Skin will be drawn upon in conjunction with Elaine Scarry’s study The Body in Pain and Julia Kristeva’s work on symbolic and semiotic modes of signification in Revolution in Poetic Language. The juxtaposition of these texts posits a non-deterministic and ethical understanding of embodied self-harm that avoids the prescriptive and co-opting narratives that commonly surround it and instead suggests it may act as an alternative and transgressive mode of open signification. It is clear that the connection between self-mutilatory practices and the construction of …

I initially mentioned, for example, Calle’s “exquisite pain” as a formula (displacing a medical term) and photographic image for an untranslatable experience of stub- born psychic pain, or jouissance. “Art is a Guaranty of Sanity” is the sentence welded above the entrance to Louise Bourgeois’ installation Precious Liquids (1992) (figure 2.1 and book cover), and it is important to find out how art might guarantee sanity, and what sanity involves from an aesthetic perspective.

ing hours, often with Rose at his side. Many visitors asked questions, and Flanagan concluded that people "seemed to understand that SM pain was a metaphor for the kind of pain they were forced to endure as illness."14 For Flanagan himself, self- induced pain seemed to be a metaphor mostly for the illness-induced pain he felt on a regular basis. Amelia Jones has pointed out that when Flanagan performed as a masochist he was "attempting to externalize his internal pain," which for him had the pleasurable effect of "reducing the pain of illness to the less ambiguous agony of the definitively physical."15 Unlike the work of other artists I have discussed in this book, Flanagan's per- formed pain seemed to go hand in hand with pleasure. But like the other artists' work, Flanagan's masochism, as Jones rightly argues, "constructs him as both acting subject and receptive object of violence, mer…

the artist’s early work. Unlike art historical studies, which associate per­ for­mances such as Unicorn (1970) or Mit beiden Händen gleichzeitig die Wände berühren (Scratching Both Walls at Once, 1974–75) with body art and video art,17 I would like to direct our attention ­toward their connection with sci­ entific contexts. The resonance between Rebecca Horn’s early imagescapes and the iconography of the medical clinic has often been pointed out.18 This chapter supplements such indications with references to experimen­ tal physiology and psy­chol­ogy as well as psychiatry. Like a laboratory scientist, Rebecca Horn calls the objects used in her early works “instruments,” and like one of the experimental physiologists par excellence, Claude Bernard, she deploys her instruments to instruct her­ self and ­others about life. At the same time, she designates the sphere at which the rele…

Th is book posits that aff ect is at the origins of this corporeal response, and that, importantly, this aff ect is not necessarily coterminous with the pres- ence of on-screen bodies. Th is approach is a departure from the psychoanalytic, representational and hermeneutic models that have previously been used to understand horror fi lm. Th ese foundational approaches, by scholars such as Noël Carroll, Carol Clover, Barbara Creed, and Robin Wood, while off ering crucial insight, have limitations in that they are largely focused on unpacking the semantic elements of fi lm. Th is book reframes an approach to horror around the somatic response, using theories of aff ect to elucidate the foundations of this corporeal interface.

and posttraumatic suffering, distinctions between physical and mental injury as well as bodily and emotional pain are difficult to uphold. The central topos that emerges in this corpus of texts is that of a wound cutting deeply into both body and mind, cutting across both spheres and through the boundaries between the two. The narra- tor of Shelley’s short story “The Mourner” – which, similar to her novella Mathil- da, explores death and pathological mourning within a complex father-daughter re- lationship – paradigmatically describes the trauma victim’s suffering as “so great as to confuse the boundary between physical and mental sensation” (89). Conceptualizations of the interrelations between the physical and the psycho- logical have further implications in the context of mental illness. As mentioned ear- lier, studying the mind of the mentally ill became important in Britain dur…

come: empathy remains a ‘wish feeling’, in which subjects ‘feel’ something other than what another feels in the very moment of imagining they could feel what another feels.9 The impossibility of feeling the pain of others does not mean that the pain is simply theirs, or that their pain has nothing to do with me. I want to suggest here, cautiously, and tentatively, that an ethics of responding to pain involves being open to being affected by that which one cannot know or feel. Such an ethics is, in this sense, bound up with the sociality or the ‘contingent attach- ment’ of pain itself. Much of the thinking on pain, however, contrasts the ungraspability of the other’s pain with the graspability of my own pain. Elaine Scarry makes this contrast in her analysis of pain and torture (1985: 4). Certainly, there is something ungraspable about the other’s pain, and this is not just because I do n…

of them, held upright by the gentle warmth of shoulders and bellies; and their satisfied desire took pleasure in this painful approach” (RM 3: 618). 33. The punitive and moralizing tone of these passages appears to represent a per- version of what Thomas Laqueur has called “the humanitarian narrative”— detailed legal, medical, and novelistic descriptions of bodily injury that evoke compassion for the injured while raising questions of causality, responsibility, and equitable redress (see Thomas W. Laqueur, “Bodies, Details, and the Humanitarian Narrative,” in The New Cultural History, ed. Lynn Hunt [Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989], 176–204). However, as Wai Chee Dimock reminds us in her Residues of Justice, 140–167, nineteenth-century humanitari- anism did not eschew the infliction of pain as a form of moral pedagogy, a “purgative” (154) or curative suffering whose long-…

characteristic between humans. The corporeal mapping of race and sex is never simple, and feminists need to ask more complex questions about the inter­ relationship of those categories and the body. It is no surprise, then, that the devaluation of women through their putative identification with bodily matters is mirrored by a similarly grounded devalua­ tion of slaves, of children, of animals, and of black people. Work in both philosophy and science studies, as the pieces by Elizabeth Spelman and Lynda Birke show, outlines a move to reduce marginalised others to their bodies. The process of categorisation that works to set in place boundaries between the normal and the abnormal, between the fully human and the sub-human, is as pertinent to the classical institution of slavery as it is to more recent biological reductionism that ties women to their reproductive functions. As Spel…

links together the notions of desire, pain and thought. She skilfully and convincingly uses her deep understanding of metapsychology and her mastery of Freud’s seminal papers to demonstrate that thought is one of the manifestations of desire, which, by definition, implies a painful renun- ciation of the object of desire. She explains the trajectory involved in the transformation of a human need into the desire of an object and the devel- opment of the capacity to tolerate pain which is intrinsic to the absence of the object of desire. Using her own words, the author states, “only desire can give rise to the activity of thought, the inalienable pleasure and privi- lege of man”. She develops this idea further by stating that thinking is not only painful but sometimes dangerous, because to think is to exist as a subject, to differentiate oneself from others, with all the risks associated with it. The author presents clinical cases that illuminate in a brilliant and

also the destitute, the mad, the poor, the distant foreigner, children and to certain extent, animals. Despite its multiple variations, what we will find in the seminal works of Elaine Scarry, David B. Morris, Marcia Meldrum, or Rosalyne Rey, among many others, has been the drive to recover the experi- ence of the vanquished, to listen to their words, to pay attention to their expressions, to sympathise with their ailments or to properly understand their miseries. What many of these historians did has been the side-effect or the correlation of what military surgeons or anaesthesiologists and neurolo- gists did in the 1940s: extending the humanitarian gaze, taking the testimo- nies of patients at face value, calling into question not just the bio-mechanical model of pain, but also the bio-mechanical understanding of history.

Introduction 19 for eleven hours can produce as violent muscle and spine pain as can injury from elaborate equipment and apparatus, though any of us outside the situation, used to adjusting our body positions every few moments before even mild discomfort is felt, may not immediately recognize this. (Scarry 47– 48) This demonstrates the use of “stress positions” as a means of torture, illustrated by the passage from Dieckmann’s novel I quoted, above. The passage from the novel also illustrates how pain isolates the experience of individuals in an interiority which is seemingly inacces- sible to others, leading, as Scarry notes, to a “split between one’s sense of one’s own reality and the reality of other persons” (4). Pain, particu- larly the deliberate heightening and amplification of it by torture, dissolves the relationship between the subject and language, reducing language …

tachment from others. On the other end of the continuum, con- temporary representations of the body in performance art, in consensual sadomasochism, and in female saints are discussed as attempts to use pain and pleasure to reconnect with the feeling self. Chapter ﬁve concludes the book by suggesting that practices of mindfulness such as vipassana or tonglen forms of Buddhist meditation represent ways for us to come to our senses and live fully aware in the present. These spiritual practices increase so- matic, emotional, and mental awareness, reuniting mind and body in ways that counteract habitual conditioning and allow us to live in permeable space. Just as Grandin came to experience connec- tions with others through the embrace of the squeeze machine, mindful attention to ordinary bodily acts such breathing and eat- ing can lead us to feel the self’s “emptiness” or fundamental inter- relatedness with other selves. Mindful touch means that we can no

Later efforts to master infantile pain may interweave with innate human curiosity regarding what lies over the border of normality. Thus the monstrous-feminine that Creed (1993) notes as ubiquitous in horror texts may relate to more than the monstrousness of the archaic mother (which Creed opposes, in somewhat traditional gender-categorization, to the “law of the father”). The growing, older child excited and alarmed by Hansel and Gretel pushing the wicked witch into the oven may be reworking early encounters with the abhorrent mother but may as well be looking for imagery powerful enough to contain his or her abundant aggression around restrictions on autonomy or insults to self-regard, or may be anxious to explore life’s awful and marvelous possibilities. Also important in conjecture about infantile experience is the awareness that later childhood and adult experience of trauma can lead to emotion and imagery

specific location, highlighting the traumatic experiences of the former slaves and the impact of the oppressive system on their bodies. These hauntological figures emerge as a return of repressed corporeality, challenging the artificial boundary between mind and body along with a number of related binaries. To highlight these figures not only brings them into a (necessary) historical focus but also draws attention to the strategies underlying their omission from mainstream cultural discourses. Part II, similarly, revolves on a return of the corporeal in the shape of monstrous narratives of resistance against being framed as Other – in the examples discussed, a non-normatively embodied female Other. The textual focus in part II – Atwood’s Lady Oracle and Carter’s Nights at the Circus – foregrounds body size and taking up space as a structuring principle of resistance against…

was at first totally absorbed in his relations with his mother.”93 Libidinalisation, like pain, operates to deflect destructive reactions away from the self, although the body may still remain a space in which the autoerotic acts of relational cruelty and reprisal take place. Libidinalisation of the body and pain will then function to move destructiveness outwards, from a system of boundaries that must be created and cannot be taken as a given. And just as the ideal ego will be affected by changes to the ego ideal, producing discon­ nects from the recognition of the body image, so too pain can be sought in order to set the body image back in place. Pain is thus necessary for an assumption of the body as one’s own body, and helps to establish its limits. It can of course be filtered through phantasy structures and the scenarios that subsequent events and 92 Katherine Banham…

imagery of the gothic narrative to portray Rhoda’s reaction. The physical- ity of this scene continues when Rhoda regains her speech and likens her aunt’s confession to that of a doctor revealing a threatening disease to his patient: “It’s as if—as if—you were to come to a perfectly well person, and tell them that they were going to die in half an hour” (52). This metaphoric afﬂiction is followed by a passage in which Rhoda states that she feels “like a mutilated man who looks where his arm was, and cannot believe it gone” (56). Physical suffering, illness, mutilation, and degeneration are used to ar- ticulate Rhoda’s identity crisis, thus linking her damaged psychological state to corporeal torture. Here, Rhoda echoes the medical discourses con- necting miscegenation with bodily decay and sees the truth of her racial mixture in terms of a corrupted body that “medicine cannot ﬁx” (52). R…

Takemoto suggests that the melancholy of illness is a form of suspended grief that resists and anticipates the possibility of the loss of a loved one. Within the col- laboration, the body’s surface became a literal and corporal register of diﬀerence and identiﬁcation which wounds the skin, which itself is already marked by illness, race and gender. In Jane Kilby’s analysis of how sexual trauma is ‘an unethical transgression of a skin boundary’, she oﬀers an understanding of skin as testimony. However, rather than suggesting that skin speaks, that it simply has a voice that can be heard by others, she suggests that the skin must be read, and that it is the reader who must embody the possibility of skin as testimony. In a close analysis of Louise Pembroke’s drawings about self-harm, Kilby shows how the self-harm testimony appears to deny any form of communication and dialogue. By thinking through how the boundary between life and death is itself animated by skin in self-harm testimony,

Introduction 13 tions about both the centrality of physical and emotional pain and the importance of meditating and dwelling on the pain of others. In poetry these questions were posed with respect to the creation of an ideal: the masculine, rational, citizen whose citizenship was predicated upon de- fensive fantasies of invulnerability. And the possibility that a militant Christ and a defensible poetry were not ideals to be cherished made possible a reconsideration of the eroticization of subjection. Before I consider these subjects more fully in Th e Faerie Queene, I will explore some Renaissance contexts for the disarmed and vulnerable bodies to which Spenser’s attention was so frequently drawn. Lucretius identiﬁ es Venus as the mother of Aeneas and his line but also as a divine force capable of soothing the hostilities of Mars to bring peace to a troubled land. Note the diﬀ…

What is more, one characteristic way in which these symbolic vocabularies operate in social discourse is by means of switchings or transcodings that draw on the con- ceptual elements of one domain in order to map the conceptual or experien- tial territory of another. According to Stallybrass and White, the body occu- pies a privileged place in this process as an “intensifying grid” through and upon which “transcodings between diff erent levels and sectors of social and psychic reality are eff ected” (26). The felt immediacy and availability of the body, what Elaine Scarry in The Body in Pain calls its aura of incontestable reality, make it an especially powerful and ﬂ exible instrument to think with. “Portrait in Georgia’s” rheto…

her thigh in her very average bedroom, or removing blades and iodine from a prettily decorated trinket box. The progression of these narratives usually reveal that the idealized image of suburban life is itself an illusion (Lee’s father is revealed as having drinking problems and her parents’ marriage to be disintegrating), meaning that the pathological status of the young female protagonists comes to act as the sign of wider ‘pathologies’ within the family unit as a whole. In a similar structural movement to the logic of sacrifice described in Chapter 2, societal dysfunction is channelled through the suffering female body, a body which is read purely as a signifier rather than according to any individualized or self-ascertained cultural value. This conceptual drive has also been apparent in some of the feminist writing which has attempted to theorize female self-injury, parti…

of disability acts to distract the reader from some other inhumanly danger- ous deviation. Yet, it is crucially important to keep sight of textual depictions of disability as representing very real human disability, and not merely as metaphor. As Michael Davidson puts it: “there are cases in which a prosthe- sis is still a prosthesis” (120); that is, in some cases “disability is not a metaphor” for something else but a reﬂection of “a lived reality” (120). In fact, the crit- ical displacement of the disabled or diseased body reﬂects the invisibility of disability in “polite” society. Seeing the non-normative body as representing itself renders that body visable and accessible to the kind of analysis that appears in the essays in this collection. Invisible and Visible As I have worked on this collection, I have been inspired by the scholar- ship of the writers who have contributed to this…

And yet, Caitlin does not merely pause in her note-taking to contemplate a striking painting—an act to which some may relate. Rather, Caitlin is overwhelmed by the image. It draws her attention with such force that it pushes out all other thought. In an instant, her concern changes from transcribing the professor’s lengthy descriptions to the visceral image that looms before her. Indeed, Caitlin’s orientation changes so drastically that she is no longer even able to attend to the professor’s voice. The image and what it makes her feel is all. The painting ﬂoods Caitlin’s senses and is felt throughout her body. It ﬁlls her nose and throat with the coppery smell of blood. She feels its wet sticky gore upon her ﬁngers. Her eyes rove and plumb its rich, dark depths. Her scalp crawls, skin tightens, and…

In her verbal fantasies his “prick” can always be huge, filling her up as a successful substitute for the structurally impotent father/Other whom she is dedicated to repair through such replacement. Jan’s now rigid body almost seems to be the space into which his phallus has expanded—the corpselike space where perhaps, paradoxically, Bess confronts the asexuated real of the body: by encountering the phallus in full like this, she is catapulted beyond the phallic function. Bess lights up upon hearing that Jan, although severely paralyzed, will live, seeming to have no thought about their lost sex life. She is devastated when Jan, much more attuned to such a loss, urges her to take a lover. “It often happens,” writes Nasio about hysteria, “that love is transformed into d…

understood as representing an anxious search for new artistic direc- tion. The sketch relies on organicist imagery; it is not a fully inte- grated body which we see (echoing with the creature’s in Frankenstein) but only a severed foot and hand. To put it simply, the hand gestures towards a higher authority, an older inspiration, whereas the artist reclines across the foot which represents more earthly, secular considerations. Within this tableau there is a juxtapo- sition of bodies in which the broken body of the Colossus is con- trasted with the human (complete) body of the artist. There is also a juxtaposition between the living and the dead and the real and the imaginary. Foucault revealingly writes in The Order of Things that, ‘No doubt, on the level of appearances, modernity begins when the human being begins to exist within his organism, inside the shell of his head, inside the armature of his limbs, and in the whole structure

integrity and stable boundaries through the penetration of resonance and re-­ sounding. Thus Noé, by drawing on the materiality of noise, solicits a listen- ing body, rather than a listening subject, before his film. This resonant body, exposed to Noé’s auditory and visual strategies, approaches Nancy’s account of the resonant body as a membrane or channel through which vibrations and sensations pass, dissolved in a mutual feedback of resonance between a self and world, listening body and film, with unfixed boundaries. In order to understand more about the film’s relation to trauma through sound, we must look now at sound’s relation to time.

desire for her presence. Language represents an effort to control through representation the traumatic separation that one must inevita- bly undergo; it is therefore always restless with desire for a presence it can only symbolize but never achieve. Because language is predicated upon the pain of absence, pain is inseparable from the pleasures of signiﬁcation. But emphasizing that pain underlying signiﬁcation—representing the gaps in language rather than representing that which is desired— offers the distinct pleasure of foregrounding the presence of language itself. One might prefer the representation of maternal absence to pres- ence, sunset to sunrise, pain to pleasure because it makes one conscious of the fact that one actually has language at hand (or a spool in hand). One may well achieve some abstract, “inﬁnite Aurora” in heaven, and that aurora may ultimately compensate for the p…

something that many of us would rather not want to see: the looming presence of death. Like Elkins (1997), we may feel that it is “painfully close to something I know I cannot or must not see” (p. 115). But we might glimpse something else as well. As we gaze upon the terribly violent death that the image documents, we may ﬁnd our eyes are drawn to the face of its victim. If we rest there and gaze upon her visage, we may perceive, like Kayla, her humanity. And, in her humanity, we may apprehend something of the mystery of existence. Looking at the woman’s counte- nance, despite—or perhaps because of—being at the moment of death, her face seems uplifted, almost joyous.2 She appears to stand in absolute deﬁance of the violence being perpetrated upon her physical body. It is as if she has risen above the vio- lence to which she is the closest witness. Her face seems to reveal her sublime grace as a human being and attests to the fact that, no matter what we might endure,

doesn’t step in to occupy her subjective perspective; instead this spatial and temporal displacement is lived transversally across character and cinematic bodies. These are two modes of negotiating this relation: in a kind of internal edit, Susan makes the cut herself through a relation be- tween hands and eyes, a direct action on her body inserting a black frame between two worlds, and then she allows the camera to take responsibil- ity for her own displacement, to move on her behalf. Two tools of cine- matic transition—the edit and the camera movement—are deployed, and they result in the first instance of reaction to seeing herself in that film, as if the goal of such encounters was to discover that otherness of the self, in an “auto-a¤ection.” Susan lives this sequence as if from within a movie, where irrational cuts are not accepted examples of a cinematic shorthand but expe…

of life in the computer. While she ﬁnds that digitization of memory gives rise to new forms of materiality in practices of remembering, she remains critical of the promises of new software programs to ﬁx and preserve private memories. She calls for a deeper understanding of the social changes that come along with new tech- nologies for remediating what is dearest to us—our very personal memories. In chapter 9, Anneke Smelik explores the digital remediations of the human body in science ﬁction ﬁlms and biomedical documentaries. She compares a recurring moment in both genres: the spectacular ride through a tunnel, either into cyber- space or into the human body. Discussing examples that range from B movies like Freejack to the sophisticated trilogy of The Matrix, she points out the heavy tra‹c between and among virtual/real, inner/outer, and fact/ﬁction that is performed by the tunnel ride. Smelik suggests that kinetic representations of cyberspace are

brought as close to me as possible. (Proust 1993: 847) Disappointment: Of this sort was the window in our hotel behind the balusters of which my mother sat waiting for me, gazing at the canal with a patience which she would not have displayed in the old days at Combray, at a time when, cherishing hopes for my future which had never been realised, she was unwilling to let me see how much she loved me. Nowadays she was well aware that an apparent coldness on her part would alter nothing, and the affection she lavished upon me was like those forbidden foods which are no longer withheld from invalids when it is certain that they are past recovery. (1993: 845–6) The idea stares hard at us, with the cruelty of disappointed love, but without this cruelty it is impossible to write. For it is impossible to think without feel- ing helpless, that is, stripped naked by a gaze. This ravishin…

during this process. Rather, the nontherapeutic approach to trauma that she describes suggests a wild utopianism-a hopefulness in despair­ that is reminiscent of the politics of despair Sylvia Townsend Warner describes in Summer Will Show. For her examples, Cvetkovich turns to artists and activists whose work is bound up with the everyday experi­ ence of feeling bad. Cvetkovich is involved with an academic and activist organization, the Public Feelings Project, that has attempted to create a political move­ ment that takes seriously such apparently useless feelings. The Chicago­ based "feeltank" associated with the group organizes an annual depres­ sion march. The protesters march in bathrobes and slippers, carrying signs that say, "Depressed? It might be political," and passing out fake prescriptions for Prozac. The point of an event like this is not only that the political landscape is bad but also that it makes you feel bad, and that

Between sessions of physical therapy and darkroom work, I was able to complete five chapters and select all the photographs by November 2000. Then I found myself unable to concentrate. By November 2001, two more false starts had gotten me only as far as Chapter Ten. I left the manuscript there and fought post-traumatic stress disorder for a year. It was during that time that my physical therapist at USC transcribed for me the words of Abraham Lincoln: "If I had eight hours to chop down a tree, I would spend six hours sharpening my axe." On Halloween 2002, I asked my editor what we should do about the book; I was still feeling poorly. She and the editor-in-chief suggested that I rethink the original concept and tr…

guardsmen, etc.), she had no other discourse at the beginning of her treatment but accounts of this desire-delirium, and her actings-out, all intimately related. On the level of transference - and to affIrm that she too, like me, could write of love - Anne began to draw comic strips representing the lives of policemen and their sexual adventures. Little by little, onomatopoetics give way to bubbles enclosing words and dialogues of increasing complexity, and to her telling me that 'these cop stories, they're like a dream, a novel.' At the next stage, Anne imagines herself a writer of love songs - but in English. One will note the utilization of drawings, and then the foreign language, to reach a more and more exact representation of unconscious contents. The sending of letters to the analyst is the following stage, expressing more directly the psychic pain and lament. Inside the sessions where she brings her writings, Anne's discourse modifies

Her work is primarily a content analysis, that is, she examines various depictions of female characters which it is difficult for females to read easily unless they adopt the position of a male reader. She states: ‘To read the canon of what is currently considered classic American literature is perforce to identify as male’ (ibid.: xii). She suggests, and Elaine Showalter’s work in this area would seem to reinforce her point, that it is standard reading practice for women students at university studying literature to position themselves as male in order to make sense of the text (Showalter 1971).6 Fetterley states: ‘While women obviously cannot rewrite literary works so that they become ours by virtue of reflecting our reality, we can accurately name the realit…

Schuyler does it; Barthes does it; Conrad does it; Ginsberg does it. Why is it so hard for me to do it? For while I’ve come to know my own body as a mother, and while I can imagine the bodies of a multitude of strangers as my mother (basic Buddhist meditation), I still have a hard time imagining my mother’s body as my mother. I can easily conjure my father’s body, though he has been dead thirty years. I can see him in the shower—tan, red, steaming, singing. I can conjure the slight oiliness of the curls on the back of his head, curls now present on Iggy. I can remember how certain clothes looked on him: a gray cable-knit sweater, his old Levi’s, his daily suit. He was a density of heat and energy and …

Her purpose was to be of use to other can- cer-sufferers who had been made to feel shame and humiliation, and indeed, this little book gave comfort to many thousands of patients and their families. In keeping with its utilitarian intent, the writing style was lucid and accessible, purged of that teasing, mystifying opacity that had charac- terized her earlier books. In examining the life-work of any writer, it is instructive to consider which themes, positions, or stylistic maneuvers are carried forth from the past, which ones abandoned or reversed—in other words, how the writer builds on infrastruc- tural footfalls he or she knows can be relied on, even as the new challenge is embraced. So, just as in Against Interpretation, Illness as Metaphor advocates a prophylactic stance against one form of rhetoric; as in On Photography, it rummages far and wide through the literature, accumulating
