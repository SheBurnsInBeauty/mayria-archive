At the same time, his fictional worlds reflect our own in a tendentious way; they make explicit structures and processes that are implicit in the infrastructure of our present world. By adding the historical continuity of the future to our social institutions he reveals the historical, contingent nature of those institutions. The fictional worlds of his novels contain political analyses that are both highly organized and highly critical. These novels thus increase the importance of the genre by making it a more engaged and historical fictional form. These are large claims. and anyone picking up a Dick novel at random and reading it may wonder at them. The truth of the matter is that Dick's",

I realized today that making collages in puberty I always looked through magazines for pictures of tits, assses, hot-looking women. No cunts—I was too chicken to be that blatant. Everything I did had to be sup- pressed somehow. Probably made the work better. But now I’m just as turned on by the sight of me, my own dick, my ass (skin- ny as it is) and my piss, shit, or whatever. I get hard looking at myself. Can you believe it? Mr. Auto Erotic. I’m not in love with myself. And it’s not that I think that I’m all that great, it’s just that I see my body for the sexual history it contains—a sexual map—and it gets me going.

I was actually reading another piece of his lately, about Bruno Mars, and trying to pinpoint what I love about his writing. SFJ is a musician himself and I think you can tell that in the rhythm of his writing – rhythm is such an important thing for me in writing, and I love the rhythm he has. But also I think it’s a certain precision he has that I admire. He has this obvious vast wealth of knowledge which makes his writing have weight, and seem so unhurried, and his sentences so fi nely-turned. Plenty of music writers can do that, I know, but SFJ marries it to something else – he’ll sud- denly deliver a single line that has a warmth or a humour or a particularly arresting image, or something that just seems very human rather than encyclopaedic.

We live in a libido- dominated world in which we share a denial about the death drive. That is capitalism and that is Heidegger’s ‘they’ thinking, but it is not our own thinking, not deep down and authentically. Deep down and authentically, we know the death drive is who we are and who everyone else is as well. As Julie Reshe says, “the darkness of the soul is the only thing we genuinely hold in common. Our internal breakdown, brokenness, malfunction, trag­ edy, and absurdity encounter who we most genuinely are.”48 That is why young Charlie will always love her uncle Charlie because her Uncle Charlie",

I am grateful for your love of me and of John, and we both thank you for the sharing of ideas over the years. John wrote some acknowledgments before his death. He wished to rec- ognize my cousin Gene Parodi and his wife, Bonnie, whose empathic pres- ence during a trip we made together to Italy in 2003 engaged John in sharing himself at increasingly intimate levels. This experience reconnected John to the power and presence of Roberto Assagioli, and this reawakening allowed us to remember that Roberto’s therapeutic presence was essentially about empathic or altruistic love.

That’s what we mean when we talk about the abundance of being that has come through our we-relationship. JACK: We both have been blessed with abundant being, but in truth, I think in that sense, you have become deeper. ANNE: Do you mean I have become deeper than you? If so, I doubt it, but thanks. Or that I have become deeper than I was? If so, that’s true. JACK: I think you have become deeper than I and much deeper than you were.

I absolutely love the consistent curiosity, the pas- sionate exploration, and the humility of open self-questioning. This is why I love science.

My greatest gratitude goes to my wife, Rebecca Wittmann, who loves our gravel road as much as I do and, more than this, knows exactly how to write a great book, so was able to help me at every turn. She makes everything possible. I dedicate this to her and to the new bodies that we belong to: Nora Kathryn, who likes to sit on my lap and help me type, and her big brother, Charlie, whose astute questions in my office the other day spurred me finally to finish this book. “Papa, are you writing different stories each day?

In a review essay on Chris Kraus, Jenny Turner comments “how much Acker there is curled up inside that book [Chris Kraus’s novel, I Love Dick]” (14). Turner captures here how Acker did change the possibilities for women’s writing. She refused the highly popular realist novel of women’s lives, the influential utopian strand of contemporary women’s experimental writing denoted by écriture féminine, and the more accessible and polished version of women’s postmodern fiction exemplified by Angela Carter and Jeannette Winterson. Rather, she forged a feminist minor literature as a bricoleuse who ‘made do’ with the culture’s treasur…",

Chris was an electrifying, shin- ing example of how to do the two at once. He embodied for me the cutting knowledge of the genius fag in its most vivid, world-­burning force.

I wish in particular that I could have made it clearer how funny Dick's novels are, and how important comedy is to his work. But I comfort myself with the certainty that better critics than I will take it from here, so that my mistakes will be corrected, and our understanding of this great artist furthered. And first explorers are often excused their errors, their omissions, their tall tales.",

What, then, is Dick’s story in this conception? Initially, Dick has a separate relation (a relation of projection) to each of his imaginary objects. What Klein does is to articulate the relations of the objects among themselves, Dick being one of the objects in the system: Dick learns to assume himself as such, to assume himself as a signifier. “Dick—little train, Daddy—big train, Dick is going into mummy.” In saying this, Klein takes the relation between Dick and the train and articulates it as a relation between two trains.

At some stages of the writing process, I have received comments from Rineke van Daalen, Eric Dunning, Jon Fletcher, Tom Inglis, Richard Kilminster, Stephen Mennell, Jakob Pastoetter, Michael Schröter, Peter Stearns, Bram van Stolk, and Luuk Wouters. I am grateful for their support and valuable comments. My language, including my translations from German and Dutch sources, has been corrected by Eric Dunning and Stephen Mennell. Thanks a lot Stephen! Thanks a lot Eric! Of course, my work owes a lot to the support of my intimates and friends of whom I would like to mention Truus, Julia, Roos, Sam, and Joost. And it pleases me enormously to dedicate this book to my grandson, Sam Voerman.…",

This psychological state of the self, split (amputation) and doubled (extension) by its mirror reflection, constitutes for Krauss not the subject matter but rather the form, or model, of video.* It is likely that McLuhan’s general alignment of mans (or woman’s) use of media with Narcissus’ experience has fed into Krauss’s assessment of the specific medium of video. There are some crucial points of comparison between the work of the media analyst and that of the art theorist that will prove important for my discussion of American body art and its modes of perception. McLuhan and Krauss focus their accounts on the human body. Media affect the body, and the subject needs to respond psychologically to this physical irritation.
