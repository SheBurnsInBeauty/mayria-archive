Hélène Cixous’ subject of love 105 in The Book of Promethea where, in her theorisation or exploration of an escape from antagonistic dualism, her subjects can be explicitly understood as encounter- ing divinity, although the nature of that divinity often remains ambiguous. Consider, for example, the tone and language of her description of just such a moment from The Book of Promethea. [I]f I get ready to embrace Promethea – and every time it is as if I were embracing the world, it is simpler and simpler and more and more religious, because from that moment on rarely does the kiss remain one between the two of us; it is scarcely given before it calls the whole universe to celebrate, in an inﬁnitesimal and incredible celebration, gen- esis ﬁlls the air we breathe – so I have scarcely bent to kiss her before I see the earth quiver, the oak tree three steps to the right of Promethea suddenly lights up, all the leaves catch,

The subject of love 180 represents – Promethea’s ‘yes’ to life that frees her to be in the present and allows her to fearlessly make extravagant, perhaps abundant, declarations of love – forces Cixous to acknowledge the binary constraints of her previous devotions. She has, she realises, always contented herself with loving (1991a: 104). But Promethea insists that, if this is to truly be a book of love, i.e., a book of divine love, Cixous must write that she too is loved. In so insisting that Cixous write that she too is love Promethea provides the occasion for her to reﬂect on the structure of love, in terms both of reciprocity and of mutuality. As I discussed in Chapter 2, reciprocity and mutuality are typically conﬁgured as occurring when two parties engage in loving each other: ‘I love you’ evokes an ‘I love you too’ – no blurring of the boundaries of subjectivity here. But Promethea…

120 Hélène Cixous giving other has a presence that raises the question how to ap- proach or love her but also, and even more importantly, of how to give oneself to the other to be loved and receive the other's love. The 'livre' of Promethea is both book and the very gesture of giving oneself, that is, of se livrer to the other. Who gives herself to whom? This movement of giving oneself exceeds the frame of the book as object, it dé-livre, unbinds, and de-livers. The writer now declares to have discovered a dispossession of the self with the theatre. The Book of Promethea is not a play, though, as in Manne, it is written as a 'braiding' of voices. But here, the author herself is asserted to be plural. She is present as writer and as narrator, as a letter, H, with aIl of the familiar associations with her own name, Hélène, a mute letter (that in fact has no aspirate traits), …

INTRODUCTION xxix The Book of Promethea concerns this endeavor to create an alternative subject position, in which both self and other coexist in a mutually enabling love.21 For Cixous, language is endemic to the repressive structures of thinking and narration we use to organize our lives.22 Since woman has figured within the socio-symbolic system only as the other of man, Cixous suggests that the inscription of women’s sexuality and history could recast the prevailing order. She sees writing as the locus and means of this reformation.23 Ecriture féminine Cixous’ name is most often associated with that of écriture féminine—“feminine writing.” For Cixous such a writing is feminine in two senses. First while Cixous suggests that feminine writing is potentially the province of both sexes, she believes women are currently closer to a feminine economy than men. As a result she sees in women’s writing the potential to circumvent and reformulate

much greater degree than Cixous’s earlier texts had done. Humour plays an important part in this process (Promethea is in fact a delight- ful, thoroughly entertaining book to read). Also signi¢cant are the many doubts, ideas and debates I, H and Promethea have over the writing of the book ^ all of which involve the reader as both an observer and a participant in the book’s creation. The narrators (partially) release the text from their control, giving it a degree of extra-authorial freedom. Pondering a ‘disorganized’ notebook in which she has written of her day-to-day life with Promethea, I feels ‘obliged’ to present it to the reader ‘in its authentic, immedi- ate state’ (p. 61). Likewise, on the penultimate page, Promethea expresses the wish that the narrators do not ‘end’ the book, as such, but instead hand over its reins to the reader to do with as they choose: ‘It’s all up to you now…

that reﬂects a period in Cixous’ work in which she was explicitly engaging with issues of sexual difference. Yet what is equally apparent in this text is the over- arching trope of a kind of divine justice that informs her analysis, including her call for women to be liberated from beneath the oppressive constraints of a patri- archal law which has been buttressed by a patriarchal notion of God. It is in the context of this spirit of something like divine justice that Cixous calls upon women to ‘write themselves’, to write the embodied experience of woman, and by what- ever means, to break through the oppression and silence of the patriarchal logos. To write – the act will ‘realise’ the un-censored relationship of woman to her sexuality, to her woman-being giving her back access to her own forces; that will return her goods, her pleasures, her organs, her vast bodily territories kept under seal; that will tear her out

served as her points of departure—Cixous works out her own theoretical and eth- ical concerns. Her writings nevertheless paint a portrait—many portraits—of Lispector. "For more than ten years now, H.C. has been teaching and writing about Clarice, painting the same head over and over—nor is she finished yet," Susan Suleiman writes (Suleiman 1991, xiv). What, we may ask, are the con- tours of this likeness? How do the attention, respect, and gentle stubbornness of Cixous's gaze frame the Brazilian author, and what are the implications of this gaze? The critics who have discussed Cixous's readings of Lispector have avoided a probing critique, and it is indeed difficult to do otherwise. Cixous's passionate reading, shading into the homoerotic, and its celebration of a woman and of the feminine, will be at least partly attractive to any feminist, and admirers of Lis- pector will appreciate Ci…

Introduction 9 At the phenomenal level of the subject’s relation to being, or perhaps in more Cixousian terms, becoming, I ﬁnd Cixous’ work on a kind of divine other-regarding love is most suggestive. For in her attention to the phenomenal experience of subjectivity a glimpse can be seen of the way in which an other-regarding love might be lived outside of and beyond the self-sacriﬁcial logic that has historic- ally dominated so much of Judaic and Christian conversations about love. In repudiating any formal allegiance to traditional religious institutions or their texts, yet in nonetheless locating so much of her writing within the language of these traditions, Cixous seems free to engage in a kind of theo-poetic philosophy that is not in a defensive relation to the orthodoxy of institutions. Thus, I want to suggest, perhaps her interest in a just relation between human beings, her theorisation of a graceful relation to and with difference, and her invocation of a

the reader of her texts can only partially participate in. Although her ‘theoretical’ writing of this period stresses the need for writing to ‘let go’, to make room for the other, her ¢ction is several steps behind this ideal. Gradually, however, with texts such as Angst, Vivre l’orange and Promethea, other voices begin to make their pres- ence felt. Cixous’s writing passes through a time of change and rebirth. Following her discovery of the writing of Clarice Lispector, and her involvement in the work of Ariane Mnouchkine and the The¤ a“ treduSoleil,herwritingmovesbeyond‘thesceneoftheuncon- scious’ and engages with the other in ‘the scene of history’. L’Indiade, Sihanouk and Manna take her writing in new directions, into new genres. The process of creating these texts helps bring fresh impetus and focus to Cixous’s overall writing project. Although her most recent writing re-engages wit…

even as it demands them. It is the complexity and audacity of this project, combined with an overpowering intellectual lucidity that remains Beauvoir’s primary legacy to us today. While antiquity plays an equally signiﬁcant role in the work of Cixous, it also stands in a fundamentally different relation- ship to the discursive space she elaborates. It is less a space of “absolute beauty” than a moment in a complex semiotic and textual weave, in which the maternal, the feminine, and a vibrant, pulsating material world offer occasions for reﬂection, enjoyment, and life, for the writing of a new world that stands not in opposition to the present, not as its negation, but as the unveiling of all that must be repressed in order to constitute that present. Cixous is less Diotima than Demeter. 2.

permits such a love? Undoubtedly, Antony and Cleopatra have indeed discovered a different register of wealth. And it is a register that is located at the heart of a self/other relation that is mediated by a feminine relation to otherness. However, while Cixous indicates the signiﬁcance of the self’s relation to its own ‘being’ as a central aspect of this different, feminine economy of desire, her analysis reaches the limits of its poetic extension at this point in ‘Sorties’. Through her reading of Achilles and Penthesileia Cixous establishes some of the conditions upon which a feminine relation to otherness may rest in the con- text of love. Moreover, she clariﬁes the importance of her understanding of the feminine as a way of being rather than as the signiﬁer of an essentially sexed body,

In this text, then, woman becomes central to poetic creation through the sublimation of the erotic and the regendering of desire into a ritual of cultural production. In essence, the woman who has been sentenced to write by the scevian example now ironically sentences herself to immortality by facilitating the establishment of a structure of exchange that undermines the totalizing effect of individual mastery. At the moment of apparent retreat, du Guillet attributes to herself the power to endow Apollo with deity while at the same time permitting Sceve to find the path to spiritua…

through a possessive ‘I’, Promethea is able to engage in a relationship with the other that calls forth, rather than negates, otherness. But Promethea is variously counterposed to the narrators, for whom the challenge of self-dispossession proves great indeed. Caught midway between an awareness that Promethea’s self- dispossession signals divine possibility, and their recognition that masculine or cultural power still resides in the security of identity categories that are neces- sarily in debt to notions of self-possession, they are reluctant to surrender their ‘self’ to the present. In the end The Book of Promethea poses the notion that a ‘genuinely’ other- regarding love is determined by a non-possessive relation to self, and through- out Cixous’ work notions of dispossession have consistently been conﬁgured in

world—one in which love is not free and spontaneous but is subject to will, desire, and manipulation, techniques in which the preceptor, as he explains, is skilled. Secrets are abolished, and love is there for the reader's taking. And yet the openness of these works, appealing as it may seem, has concomitant dangers. If there is no frame, the reader is much more at risk. The reader of the treatises does not pretend to be like the poetic lover. He or she is the lover these texts represent. Since his or her love is therefore real rather than imagined, it lacks the protective cushioning of fantasy. And since the text claims to be true—unlike love poetry, which defines itself as fictional—it runs the risk of being proven false if it does not co- incide with the reader's experience and expectations. These dangers do in fact materialize as the reader proceeds through these expositio…

xxvi INTRODUCTION Hélène Cixous is the author of some forty books and over a hundred articles, including works of fiction, drama, philosophy, feminism,1 literary theory and literary criticism. Of this vast oeuvre by far the majority are works of fiction, and so it is somewhat surprising that Cixous should be known, in the English-speaking world at least, as primarily a theoretician and critic. Of her books published to date, thirty-four are works of fiction or drama.2 The Hélène Cixous Reader comprises translated extracts from across the full range of Hélène Cixous’ oeuvre, illustrating her work as a feminist and literary critic, and the concerns, scope and style of her fictional and dramatic writing. The extracts are presented chronologically in order to reveal the development of Cixous’ thought, and each text is prefaced with a short introduction situating the passage in the context of the work from which it is

Promethea comes up with ‘Promethea Falls in Love’ (p. 211). At this point, the text ends with two lines of unattributed dial- ogue (p. 211): A Falls? A Is. These lines can be read as a suggestion that the title should be ‘PrometheaIsinLove’.However,theycanalsobesaidtobeanindi- cation that Promethea simply ‘is’. That is to say, in the ¢nal analysis the bald fact of her existence (her ‘is-ness’) is all that can be gleaned from the pages of Promethea’s book. From one point of view, there- fore, the pages of her book appear to have been condensed and focused into one deceptively mundane, single, mysterious word. However, as Cixous points out in the interview in this present book, appearances can be deceptive. The French word ‘est’ (‘is’) can also be translated as ‘east’, as Cixous remarks: ‘that’s how the language plays: in several directions and at several levels’ (see Chapter 6). Anyattemp…

indiscreetly, and that her reasons for leaving her room will soon become clear. Then, following immediately the scenes between Antigone, the Nurse, and Ismene (pp. 82–93), comes an exchange between Antigone and her ﬁance´, Haemon, in which they declare their love for one another and imagine their future happiness together (pp. 93–6). Despite the apparent contradiction with the characterization of Antigone as child, this romantic theme in fact ﬁts seamlessly with it. We hear that Antigone’s and Haemon’s relationship has not been consummated, and so the idealized love that Antigone feels for him is as much a utopian fantasy as her perfect childhood. Anouilh, throughout his career, regularly drama- tized thwarted romances (for example, in Eurydice [1941] and Rome´o et Jeanette [1945] ) as a means of expressing the sordid effects of the world on what was true and beautiful, but essentially ephemeral and impossible. It is from this perspective, then, that I believe we are to under-

performing impressive tasks.” But by the end, she has passed into a kind of fugue state, half recalling, half imagining how she sent him Nessus’s poisoned shirt. Oenone is full of pathos and anger: “You take your plea sure now in whores who leave their husbands/ to come with you across the expanse of the sea.” She likens the faithless and shallow Paris to “leaves/dropped from the tree that the slightest wind can stir/ this way and that to ﬂ utter and then lie still for a while.” Sappho is full of yearning for everything she has lost because of her love for Phaon: “My songs will not come. My lyre and plectrum/ lie mute in my hands.” Dido ﬁ nds it inexplicable that Aeneas would rather found Rome than spend his life with her. Ariadne, heartbroken and frightened after Theseus has abandoned her on a seemingly deserted island, likens her dishe veled hair to a Bacchante’s— little knowing that in a moment Bacchus himself

concepts of woman and liberté; Hélène Cixous, who coined the concept of écriture féminine and whose engagement with antiquity is as com- plex and multivoiced as her work itself; and Marguerite Duras, whose novels and ﬁlms elaborate a uniquely feminine style that looks forward to the experimental textual practices pioneered by Cixous and Irigaray, while recapitulating what is in its essence a Platonic and Lacanian vision of the sublime. Beauvoir is, of course, a central ﬁgure in the history of feminism. She has read Plato and has a clear knowledge of the traditional interpretation of his texts in modern France, but, as we shall see, antiquity itself serves for her not only as a source of the present but also as a locus of freedom and transcendence. Cixous, as one of the most proliﬁc female authors in modern France, is also one of the three canonical “French feminists.” This terminology is not unproblematic, but the inﬂuence of her concept of écriture féminine is undeniable and her

be reduced to a “masculine economy.” Cixous has an avowedly passionate relationship with her intertexts, and her delight at the discovery of Clarice Lispector is well-known. At the same time her work is exceptionally open to male writers (such as Joyce or Genet) and political figures (such as Mandela) in whom she can sense a feminine. In, for example, “La Venue a l’éeriture” she (a writer, and therefore a reader) is alternately mother, child, lover, beloved, giving and receiving sustenance in an abundance of fantasmatic relationships which do seem before or beyond any stable economy of sexual opposition, and which she terms “feminine.” Two: The Gift Given Time is also highly intertextual with respect to Derrida’s own oeuvre, obsessively auto-erotically footnoted—revealed to HÉLÈNE CIXOUS AND JACQUES DERRIDA 127

xvi INTRODUCTION Be. , Western art, an unconscious record of the West's reliance on mimetic repre- sentation as a vehicle for social and metaphysical solace. Following the shape of my argument, the chapters in this book are grouped into two parts. The first part presents an analysis of the Zeuxis narrative. I begin by explaining the relevance of myths and legends about artistic creation for the study of visual culture. While long-lived legends such as those of Veronica's Veil, St. Luke Painting the Virgin, Pygmalion and Galatea, the Corinthian Maid, and Apelles Painting Campaspe contrib- ute to our understanding of the history of Western art, the legend of Zeuxis Selecting Models stands apart. Zeuxis Selecting Models taps into the un- conscious history of art. In chapter 1 I also present an account of classi- cal mimesis. As acknowledged by the writings of Plato, Xenophon, and Aristotle, classical mimesis became a privileged mode of representation

feminine economy than men. Cixous’ insistence on the cultural interpretation of anatomical sex is important here, since her work has been branded with the charge of biological essentialism. Cixous reads two biblical scenes as illustrations of the ways individuals may respond to prohibition. Both Eve, in the book of Genesis, and Abraham are issued with instructions they cannot comprehend, yet only Eve questions and defies these to discover the truth for herself. Clarice Lispector is cited as the writer whose work has come closest to locating and conveying a feminine relation to others. Cixous describes Lispector’s texts as books “of the right distance.” Unlike the (masculine) approach which appropriates whatever he (sic) designates as other, Lispector’s writing, Cixous argues, entails a “relentless practice of deegoization” in which both self and other can coexist “as equals.” Recalling the author’s endeavor in The Book of Promethea, writing is again valued

the creature, as that which renders language limited and apophatics nec- essary. Hughes notes that the women mystics remedy this blind spot by setting the divine-human relation in the context of intimate love, which includes the body and the world of human-human relations in a more robustly incarnate vision. However, where the fulﬁllment of this divine- human love relation seems to ultimately eclipse the integrity of the human (woman) partner, and with it the embodied world, Hughes ar- gues that the work of Cixous can function as a theologically fruitful sup- plement. Cixous may offer a vision of an embodied apophatic of intimate love that preserves the embodied integrity of both partners while render- ing a poetics that might inform the speech of theology.

take to be Cixous’ conception of divinity, and for this reason I turn to them before considering in detail her exemplary divine love story, The Book of Promethea (1991a), in Chapter 5. In ‘Grace and Innocence’ (1992), Cixous’ subject of innocence is one who has a speciﬁc relationship to time. In proposing that the issue of the Fall is not one that concerns knowledge per se, but rather a way of living knowledge, Cixous privileges a relationship to subjectivity that approximates something like a non- self-present present. Developing her earlier work in ‘Sorties’, she suggests that in a feminine relation to self-possession – a relation that is actually marked by the dispossession of self-possession – can be found a different way of thinking of the subject who knows it knows, i.e., a different way of thinking about the subject that was inaugurated in the Fall. The subject of a ‘second innocence’, and thus of paradise, then, is the feminine subject of the present who has relinquished

‘seventy-two hours’ (p. 20). Suddenly, the telephone rings and a voice enquires: ‘‘And Iran?’’ (p. 22). This interruption to her inter- nal reverie, a reminder of an upcoming demonstration in support of the women of Iran, reconnects her with external events. She understands that a place must be found for the women of Iran, for the East, for history, in the ‘inner Orient’ of her writing (p. 20). In terms of Cixous’s writing, this realization takes several years to bear fruit. Promethea is an important staging point along the way, but in order to achieve the full e¡ect she desires ^ a writing where the political exists alongside and with the personal ^ Cixous ¢nds that it is necessary to move some distance away from the world of ¢ction and embrace the world of the theatre instead.

of the woman. […] I see here a wonderful, deeply meaningful allegory of the development of man and woman to full and complete humanity.12 Consequently, it is clear that Hélène Cixous’s writing makes an effort to play on the alternatives in a text that carries the traces of these alterations and that makes a motivating force of the heterogeneity that constitutes it: This book could be called Pierre Vole, no one would know what this title means. Pierre Vole would fly and reach his/its secret goal, every one would receive one pierre or another, what is important is that ‘Pierre’ should fly, he or she, coming from a he [il] or from a she [elle], or from an isle [îie] or from an el’.

tions under these influences. Although it is not possible to exclude another, more complex, possibility, this change could also have been planned by the author shaping the content in perfect harmony with its form. The structure of the Dialogues, in fact, reveals a theoretical plan for the work that is inserted into the same medieval Neoplatonic Alexandrine tradition, which aims to continue Boethius’s theories explicitly carried on by Ficino and Pico as well. The first dialogue, ‘On Love and Desire,’ thus represents the first and lowest level of an intellectual itinerary connecting the ‘Love’ theme to practical and concrete dimensions, i.e., with ethical or political issues. The second dialogue, ‘On the Universality of Love,’ represents the second step; its content involves a natural feature spreading out from physics, and mythological matters, which in turn is connected to cosmology and astrol- ogy. The third dialogue, ‘On the Origin of Love,’ is the third and most ele-

feelings in a responsible way. Without this acceptance, romantic life and personal ethical choices are reduced to instruments for our survival. I believe that love may be prompted by lucky chemistry, but it is tested over and over by life. It requires us to accept our own vulnerability. It demands a refined ethics to pass the tests life gives us and to understand the meanings that they offer. It seems that love—​good and healthy love—​involves an ethical component. This ethical component requires us to use our freedom to move toward the tranquility that Epicureans identified as happiness (more on this in the next chapter). In this chapter I will draw from the life of one of my clients, which I will compare to the story of Odysseus and Penelope. I will analyze Odysseus and Penelope’s story as a paradigm of a challenging love story in order to understand what makes their tale so …

weeping by the beach. His captor is a nymph, and lives in a land with none of the apparatuses of civilisation; he wishes to return to his home and wife. In time, he will be offered a much more plausible match, Nausicaa, the beautiful daughter of the Phaeacian king. Yet he rejects her too, and not before recounting the story of his time spent bed-​sharing with Circe (another divine island-​dweller). These episodes are located at one level in the fantastic, archipelagic ‘other space’ of his travels; but they suggest real places too, the colonised islands on the horizons of the eighth-​century audience’s consciousness. For all that the narrative tempts its listeners or readers with the possibility of consequence-​free dalliance in foreign spaces, the poem is highly normative, teleological, in its steering of Odysseus back to his Ithacan wife and endogamous family.

fact that the love is unreciprocated, or felt to be so, that provokes precisely this feeling. At the same time, the lover will feel uplifted by the experience of loving the beloved: their very love, whether or not reciprocated, will, at least in the ﬁrst ﬂush of love, bring the ego into relationship with the Self archetype. This will be experienced as tremendously uplifting in the person’s life. His Dark Materials is a tale partly about the value and efﬁcacy of human love. In this trilogy, the writer gives us a new Adam and Eve myth, a different story of human “salvation” (Pullman, 1995.). In the girl Lyra’s world, a parallel universe to our own, everyone has a personal “daemon”, a real creature that is at the same time also their non-human alter ego. A child’s daemon can take on a variety of animal forms; only when a person becomes adult does their daemon take on a ﬁxed form. Will, a boy from our world, discov- ers his own daemon in the course of the tale. Thus, we all have a

the bridegroom, as though the commitment to Christ is like the enforced position of woman. Marriage to the beautiful woman with ethereal appearance and ‘sea-green’ eyes is what might allow him to feel male, his imagination dressing himself as a young cavalier if he were to become her lover (p. 125). In this attitude to gender relations in love he again contrasts very markedly with d’Albert in Mademoiselle de Maupin, who, despite searching for the ideal feminine form, has little fear about considering himself as female and Rosette as male when seeking to attain a union in love that transcends the purely carnal,66 and then happily falls in love with a man when contemplating ‘his’ androgynous perfection. Gautier, like Balzac (whom he had recently befriended), appears to have taken an interest in Swedenborg’s marriage of the angels as described in On Conjugial Love.67 ‘La Morte amoureuse’ was published one year after Balzac had published Séraphita, his tale of a seraph, or

of female emancipation but also suggests how Labe's impas- sioned appeal to the women of Lyons to forsake their tradi- tional domestic roles in search ofequality with men in the social and literary community prefigures her subsequent poetic effort to equalize male and female roles in the Petrarchan love lyric. Furthermore, my discussion considers how Labe's richly poly- valent, sometimes eroticized diction subverts conventional gen- der categories and proposes new models of female agency that will be enacted in her other works. The third chapter turns to Labe's only other narrative work, Le Debat de Folie et d'Amour, a long mythological prose dia- logue that pits the allegorized figures ofAmour and Folie against one another in a complex ethical argument over their respec- tive powers and identities during a banquet at Jupiter's court. 10 5

particular, to a timely makeover on the part of the goddess Athene, Odysseus—this unlikely arrival—is rapidly transformed into the perfect image of the appropriately eligible man. Like the events of Pride and Prejudice, Nausicaa’s momentous washday is explicitly framed by marriage expectations. The night before, she has a dream that is arranged by Athene, who has Odysseus’s interests at heart. (To Nausicaa it just seems that her best friend has been put- ting in practical nocturnal hints in relation to the larger but ordinary life-plan for her future.) Nausicaa should go and do the laundry because, as everyone knows, weddings are not to be had without decent clothes to put on. When she awakes the princess is all set to carry out this plan.

sixteenth-century France, bidding farewell to his jealous virginal sweetheart; in four, the now Teutonic soldier goes off to a brothel in frustration before leaving; in five, before finally leaving for Troy, he goes home, only to find his sweetheart in his bed. Rumour has it too that Helen is happy with Paris anyway. The temporal and spatial circling is both a fantasy structure and a metafictional device which points to the literary and fictive ontological status of the text. Carpentier's next tale in the volume is a fragment of a text, beginning at Chapter Four. Already the reader is made aware of the textual identity of the story. It turns out to be essentially a multicultural coming together of all the flood myth heroes, their gods, and their creation myths. In some cultures man is born of woman (Noah), in others of pebbles (Deucalion), in others, of palm seeds (Amaliwak). This latter,

The real crux of the problem would not be an either/or choice, but a mediation between the two, something that she herself inadvertently hints at in her recent Nuit miraculeuse, a scenario for Ariane Mnouchkine's film on the contem- porary heritage of 1789. Cixous needs to be read less against herself—less as a proper name, a cult sponding to certain shifting preoccupations of global importance, though they might be articulated, in her own style, from a French vantage point. Through her readings we sense a concern both aesthetic and ethical for the world, and a grow- ing preoccupation with a site, a milieu, that is, with a need for new and other links with the world, the self, and, it is hoped, social collectivities.

mixed with white; no longer is there the vigour and energy and all that lately was so pleasing to behold; nor does the body, which Echo had once loved, remain [l l. 437-42; 448-50; 459-64; 471-73; 487-93]. Unable to stop at an acceptance of this mirroring vision of itself, the novel proceeded, at least in some critics' eyes, to pine away until the form barely remained. These critics share Ovid's viewpoint on Narcissus' fate. They argue that, like Narcissus, the novel began to lose those attractive features-of action, of personality- which had made it so beloved (in the last century) to become absorbed in a deeper self-reflective state which- and herein lay the fear- threatened to deny the novel's existence as a realistic narrative of something outside itself. Literature at this stage, writes Foucault: n'a plus alors qu'à se recourber dans un perpétuel retour sur soi, comme si son discourse ne

and lived in a natural environment in which “the soul of the world (die Seele der Welt), the holy air, still surrounded him in its omnipresence.”23 The World Soul flows through history, forming an intellectual connec- tion between the heroic past and an idealized future. This future, for Hyperion, lies of course not only in political freedom but in an aes- thetic ideal that he projects onto Diotima, compelling her yet again to abandon any subject-position she might attain for herself in favour of an idealization that supports Hyperion’s cause. As he writes to her, the new world will be “a copy of you. O you, with your Elysian silence, if only we could create that which you are!”—the silent woman as Elysian Utopia.24 By contrast, Byron’s narrator and hero are not compelled to worship an eternal spirit of Greece, neither as a past ideal from which the modern world has fallen, nor…

them, rendering them habitable without removing their awful power. This is true both of the forbidden forest itself, with its ruined abbey turned safe haven, as well as for the sublimity topos of Savoy, the alpine wonders of which Adeline seeks for her eventual home by the novel’s end. That the kind of jaded, weary knowledge that Burke warns of should not come with repeated trial is signaled by Adeline’s repeated reflection on her vulnerability to deception and her willingness to preserve this vulnerability. Radcliffe’s narrator draws a connection between the aesthetic sublime and what I have come to think of as the ethical sublime. Even quite early in The Romance of the Forest, the narrator makes such a link explicit: “When from these objects [the romantic glades that opened into the forest] she turned her regard upon Monsieur and Madame La Motte, to whose tender attentions sh…

chapters, with the difference that the later chapters act as the feminist post- modern reconstructions of the fi rst two. Chapters 1 and 5 and Chapters 2 and 4 may be seen as couplets, each member of which plays off the other’s main aspects of enjoyment, with the third chapter providing the hinge that centers the ideas developed in those couplets concerning the meta phor of lovemaking. The last chapter moves the previous chapters’ arguments be- yond themselves, leaving them on the verge of opening up to another pos- sible set of circular motions. Hence, the structure of the book seeks to imitate the open- ended and mutually indwelling “dance about” or choral movement of perichoresis (circumincession) through which the fellowship in the Godhead becomes characterized by intimacy, a “cleaving together” of God and cosmos embracing each other, as they enter into each other, permeate …

Journeys, traversaIs, are the very stuff of aIl her writing. As readers, we are invited to accompany her on her jour- neys and follow the invitation to explore ourselves. In these texts, life is a quest, a se arch for others, for what agitates us. To stop is to die. AlI modes of confinement have to be lifted. AlI has to be traversaI and flow. Life is full of bubbling springs, it is made of mystery. Once a mystery or an enigrna has been solved, we need to go on to another mystery. To an exterior journey, there corres- ponds an inner, imaginary journey through oneself and through texts. And we need to remember that texts as desire 'make pos- sible' what they desire by opening new spaces. Through a search for her others, C…

became especially apparent in literary representations of an unmarried queen as an object of sublimated desire. Most importantly, the idea of feminine chastity which was emphasized by Petrarch and the Renaissance Neoplatonists acquired a new and unexpected significance when associated with a woman who was possessed of both political and spiritual authority. Attitudes to love derived from Petrarchan love poetry and Florentine Neoplatonic philosophy were widely disseminated among western courtly societies during the European Renaissance. Although, as I shall show, these discourses differed in several respects, both systems combined a curiously paradoxical conception of a beloved woman with emphasis upon the search of a male lover for a new identity. The female beloved was declared by poets and writers to be the true object of the processes of emotional enquiry delineated in their discourses of love, and was accorded an exaggerated emotional and imaginative

of both, are brought to perfection. For when the Creator came to the cre- ation of woman, he rested himself in this creation, thinking that he had noth- ing more honorable to create; in her were completed and consummated all the wisdom and power of the Creator; after her no creation could be found or imagined. Since, therefore, woman is the ultimate end of creation, the most perfect accomplishment of all the works of God and the perfection of the universe itself, who will deny that she possesses honor surpassing every other creature? Without her the world itself, already perfect to a fault and complete at every level, would have been imperfect; it could only be perfected in the 26. It is a fundamental postulate of Aristoteltan physrcs that the heavens-from the moon outward-are eternal and possessed of a different kind of matter from that of the earth Only the elements (earth, air, fire, water) from which the earth and things on it are created are corruptible; heavenly

From femin ine to human: cultural pluralism 95 The singular love story intersects with the universal, that is, with the story of the country: 'And aIl this martyrdom will have been a long and painful marriage ceremony. The marriage of a people with its land. '20 The tactics of the homage and its style are familiar. Cixous chooses to write about an ideal person or couple, in order to say what is, was or could be. Beyond the misery of which she is most aware, she chooses to enter the scene of history with extraordinary characters with whom she identifies: mythic and literary figures, Achilles and Penthesilea, or Anthony and Cleopatra are joined by Winnie and Nelson. Her interest in history written with closed eyes that see with inner vision leads her to develop further her interests in epic theatre where scenes of writing-as-history can be performed dif- ferently.

mutable, and subject to defilement.” All of these terms work to further define feminine thinking and feminine constructs of time in apposition to male attempts to historicize a kosmos of “good order” through the binding of perceived threats to that order. Here she explores the importance of the metaphor of women’s headgear to the ancient Greek patriarchal order and in particular the symbolism of the headbinder for Sappho as a hermetic lid on female purity to prevent “leakage.” Carson admits she is unsure whether or not Sappho’s use of the image is meant to condone or to critique—rather, it “confirms” the Greeks’ beliefs that the female “plays havoc with boundaries and defies the rules that keep matter in place” (152). Thus, Anne Carson’s Men in the Off Hours always suggests the limits and destructive agenda of patriarchal time. The poem “First Chaldaic Oracle” enacts a Gnostic med…

When Pygmalion returns home, and goes to kiss the statue on the couch, She seemed warm: he laid his lips on hers again, and touched her breast with his hands-at his touch the ivory lost its hardness, and grew soft: his fingers made an imprint on the yielding surface, just as wax of Hymettus melts in the sun and, worked by men's fingers, is fashioned into many different shapes, and made fit for use by being used. The lover stood, amazed, afraid of being mistaken, his joy tempered with doubt, and again and again stroked the object of his prayers. It was indeed a human body! The veins throbbed as he pressed them with his thumb [Corpus erat! saliunt temptatae pollice venae].

her original self. Returning to Emma’s sense of the mural gazing back at her, might the sublime be an experience of looking beyond the image as image and seeing the image as being? Might this be why the image seems so startling when it speaks back to us? If this is the case, when we experience the sublime, we do not merely look upon an image; we may be encountering the image in its abso- lute otherness. We may be experiencing the full realization of the image’s intention when brought into existence. And yet, there might still be more that can learned from Medusa’s story. Con- sider Medusa’s original form, that which she was before Athena changed her. It is claimed that Medusa was not only the most beautiful of the three Gorgons but that she was one of the most beautiful woman ever made, which was why she had so many mortal and divine suitors.

with powers of uncertain limits and motives of slender intelligibility. Although bearing the names of classical deities, they operate at some distance from Homer and Vergil. The Latin Mercury, for instance, corres- ponds not only to the Greek Hermes, but to the Egyptian god Thoth: he represents often the teachings of the fashionable Hermetic cult. This was based on recently discovered documents believed to go back to the Egypt of Moses’ time. Hermetism, in Bruno’s view, was superior to Christianity and was destined to supersede it. In the system propounded in the dialogues, the phenomena we observe are the eVects of a world-soul which animates nature and makes it into a single organism. The world of nature is inWnite, with no edge, surface, or limit. But the world’s inWnity is not the same as God’s inWnity because the world has parts that are not inWnite, whereas God is wholly in the who…

has pointed out, and as the lines of the poem read, the things of the earth are ends in themselves. The worship of nature, in a very Wordsworthean sense, is a means by which the sorrow and pain may be somewhat lightened: the shape of beauty "moves away the pall from our dark spirits". Following this apostrophe to physical beauty, the narrative proper begins. The scene is set upon the mountain of Latmos and the shepherds of Latmos are celebrating the feast of Pan. Endymion comes upon the scene and is described in images suggesting a fallen god: . . . His youth was fully blown, Showing like Ganymede to manhood grown; And, for those simple times, his garments were A chieftain king's: beneath his breast, half bare, Was hung a silver bugle, and between His nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen. A smile was on his countenance; he seemed To common lookers on, like one who dream'd Of idleness in groves Elysian: But there were some who feelingly could scan

in La Belle Dame and Lamia. At the age of twenty, Keats could apparently still indulge in "the fancy that the dream-goddess and human maid are actually one - which is, of course, what we should all like to believe at one stage".20 It does seem to me that we can read the final book of Endymion as a rather fitting conclusion to all that has taken place in the first three; Book IV is simply a unifying development of the deification of erotic impulses which we have seen throughout the poem. Keats is trying to make it indisputably clear that erotic love is the su- preme value. He does this by suggesting that love for an immortal goddess and love for a mortal woman are the same. Keats is end- ing the poem on the same idea he has developed throughout, showing the almost supernatural power of human love to im- mortalize those who worship at its shrine. The introduction of the Indian maiden into the poem is neces- sary and structurally in keeping with everything else of importance

imaging,” as Inger sings, and clearly we’re meant to understand that she’s making a crucial distinction, that the world as imagined by a woman might be completely different. (387–8) Indeed, the ending of the novel valorizes revision over replication as well. Helle has died, killed by the habit she shared with the narrator Fran, the habit that killed Angela Carter as well: smoking. She leaves her unfinished opera to Fran to complete, and in an effort to find out what and how Helle would have finished the piece, Fran attempts to piece together the different tales of Helle’s life. The novel interweaves this tentative biography with Fran’s memories of her relationships with Helle and with Sam, the husband of Helle’s niece—but Fran finds herself creatively blocked, in large part because of the awe in which she holds Helle. She is not able to finish the opera until she throws off her…

where she would be “enshrined and worshipped as a household Saint, in the light of her husband’s fireside” (461). Thus, the novel has generally been read as endorsing Hilda’s world-view. Nevertheless, the novel also subtly criticizes her narrow views. First of all, as Richard Brodhead and other critics have noted, it is clear that Kenyon capitulates to Hilda mainly because he is in love with her (Brodhead, “Introduction” xxii). Second, her moral immaturity is illustrated (for a Protestant audience) by her need to confess to a Catholic priest and her exaggerated relief from this remedy. Third, her cruel rejection of Miriam and obsessive concern with her own purity have struck many readers as selfish and misguided. Both Miriam and Kenyon reproach Hilda for her severe and merciless judgment, as hard and remorseless as a “steel blade” (384). Even Hilda doubts the ethical soundness …

environment, and to connect present-day occurrences with past events. These different uses come together in the episode in which Mimi, her eyes misting over with tears at the thought of the suffering that Aurélie and Philippa endured in the past, remembers that ‘It was a misty morning when Philippa had first come to the cove’ (p. 21). Mist is further associated with the visits that Aurélie pays to the menhirs and the visions they inspire in her. The impression that Légende gives of a continuum of woman-identified experience connecting two generations of women is accentuated by the spiralling structure of the narrative and by the strategies of repetition that Allard introduces. Key events, such as Philippa’s arrival on the Brittany coast, are recounted from more than one perspective, while the situation of Mimi, the representative of the present generation, frequently echoes tha…

Observe here the power of Chloe’s imaginary identifications – that is, she sees in Daphnis the perfection she wishes in herself, both visually and tactilely; note how she touches herself to see if her skin is as soft as that of Daphnis (1.13.2). As noted, Longus’ text is a elaborate symbolic structure which relies heavily on the force of mental images, phantasia, conjured by words. To the extent that Lon- gus’ narrator is an indicator of the text’s implied reader, the reader of Daphnis and Chloe is expected to make such Imaginary identifications, which will add power to the significances of the Symbolic order, all items furnished for both education and pleasure. Further, as noted, since objet a is the true motivator of desire, and all substitutions for it merely temporary and (very) approximate, there is al- ways a restless, repetitive search for further substitute…

After this, when her sadness coincides with a full moon, she goes to the seashore to be swallowed by Manjiku. Manjiku swallows her but casts her onto the seashore. His spell is broken and when Amadé opens her eyes, she sees a gentleman standing by her side. In “Serafine I” and “Serafine II,” we see that Serafine talks about her island and brings images of the island into her stories to Miranda and Xanthe. Talking about the island as a place where she was born, lived, and left her daughter behind to come with Anthony Everard and Kit to England acts as a life force for her. Moreover, it empowers her in the family. Serafine reminds us of Sycorax, with Korkmaz believing that Serafine’s voice is actually “the continuum of Sycror…

being mediated by nonhuman affective agencies.” Speitz, like others in this volume, links the materiality of affect to aesthetics and in so doing reminds us how mundane everyday facts like air, oxygen, and respiration are actually profoundly weird and, to use her word again, sublime. Yet here this type of material sublimity carries over to the textual and the aesthetic as well since “human words and marks share space with the nonhuman page and once uttered aloud, they take shape in not-exclusively human sounds, sounds made manifest by contingent collaborations of earth, air, verse, and versifier.” By rethinking aesthetics in the light of such nonhuman agencies, the romantic sublime thus becomes, in Speitz’s hands, more than anthropocentric terror—boundless ecology and ontology. Her essay, then, has powerful ethical implications. Indeed, her study of romantic aerography and acoustics underscores how “romantic affect and aesthetics can dampen

Show, in which she imagines an improbable lesbian love affair against the backdrop of the failed 1848 revolution in Paris. The novel links the "impossibility" of lesbian love to the impossible object of revolutionary transformation. The novel ends as its heroine sits down to read The Communist Manifesto after the failure of the coup and the death of her lover. I argue that Warner describes a form of hope inseparable from de­ spair, a structure of feeling that might serve as a model for political life in the present.  o ln.' the epilogue, I consider the importance of feeling backward in contemporary queer cultural production.

support.” Such support and the sharing of a life extend to Aurora embrac- ing Marian and her child and taking them in under her protection. She convinces Marian to journey with her to Tuscany, back to Aurora’s moth- er’s home, and Aurora tells her that she has “a home for [her] and no one else” (VI: 454). Aurora’s care and love for Marian is so pronounced that she encourages Marian to rise from her “grave” and live with Aurora as her companion, a move that is similar to the attachment that Shirley Keeldar and Caroline Helstone feel for one another in Charlotte Brontë’s Shirley, when Caroline suggests that Shirley would be enough for her, that she doesn’t need a man (226) and Shirley “need[s no society] but that of Caroline” (237). Aurora entreats Marian to “Come with me, sweetest sister/And sit within my house and do me good/From henceforth, thou and thine, ye are my own” (VII: 117–119). This invitation to live with

Cixous goes some way to resolving the suppression and misunderstanding of Dionysus in the lives of men, where he is so often misrepresented as a philandering drunkard, a wayward and destructive Don Juan. As the god of music, dance and theatre, certainly of tragedy (thereby ambiguously sharing with Apollo the patronage of poetry), the god of the mask, and the god of fluid change and re-invention of the ever more fragmentary self, we have a source of discovery, a source of revelation and shocking wonderment at the transience of all life and all art, but also in his ‘effeminacy’, his sexual ambiguity and shape-shifting fluidity, a rebuttal of those stolid patriarchal virtues of constancy and conservatism. His is an enlivening breath, and a call to poetry, to the erotic, and a call back to water. 24 Cixous, ‘The Laugh of the Medusa…

tered thus far, because it marries singularity and determinacy with generic- ity and plurality, yielding neither an undifferentiated and abstract notion of humanity nor a diversity of individuals with nothing in common. The second half of the chapter explores how Serres develops further the con- tinuity between epigenetics and hermeneutics which Malabou begins to elaborate in Avant demain. Humanity is best understood, for Serres, as part of the ‘Great Story’ (Grand Récit) of the universe, a story not only about but also told by the natural world in a way that emphasises the continuity between ‘human’ language and ‘nonhuman’ processes. This insistence upon continuity between the human and the nonhuman also positions Serres very differently to Badiou, Meillassoux and Malabou, who all continue to assume that humanity inhabits a meaningless and indiffer- ent universe, and continue to maintain that to think otherwise is anthro-

world. This imaginative seeing in which the sun itself becomes a reverie object is nevertheless very much outside the visual field, behind a huge dark-lensed port where reverie is safe. Its meaning emerges as the reverse side of the represented world, as a negation of it. This is, of course, for the reader the experience of the imaginary. And if we consider the role of the material imagination here, we discover that it is the touching of the sun which activates the image. Furthermore, their eyes are thinking it, not merely passively registering its presence. Though dreaming further on this image of melted gold, the reader gains ac- cess to a realm of the fabulous, a land of conquest and plunder beyond the rain- bow. If we dwelt too long with this image we would find a reverie that would

Once predicated on rescuing humanity from imminent extinction, the narrative closures (with miniscule cracks) of the series now move beyond humanist considerations: a feminandroid and feminalien gaze upon the Earth at the end of Alien Resurrection. A beautiful globe, female figures looking and looking good: lines of flight and lines of sight – movements, projections and identifications enabled by code and vision machines shedding all but the semblance of nature, species, gender. The flight of the heroine, her fears, her desires, her fantasies and anxieties, takes off elsewhere: other identificatory possibilities and configurations (post-, trans-, hyper-) generate other prospects and projections. The logic of a particular version of the “post” – post-human and post feminist – seems fully realized in Alien Resurrection: the categories of human and gender appear obsolete, along with all the ideological bases – nature, bodies, feelings, ideals – that support them. From the black hole

juxtaposed with a “misty, indefinite” film of distance dreaming, in the same way as what the exactitude of the photograph’s physical surface that it heightens, is only a temporal hallucination. In many places of her description, like Wang Qiyao’s tableau vivant in the contest and this scene, present is revealed only retrospectively through the mist of distant time, so that future loss casts a shadow on the most festive scene and is displaced in the narrative into the characters’ inexplicable psychology of anticipatory loss and mourn- ing. In this light, the wedding of Eros and mourning reflects the time scheme of the novel of nostalgia—the fusion of past, present, and future that by turning death from figure to fact and festival into mourning in its retrospective narrative, creates the timeless aura of nostalgia. The transformation from loss to timelessness is parallel to the photograph’s welding of the momentary shot that

In Finnegans Wake, Shem's riddle of love, obscene and sublime, refers to the tradition of Eros the bittersweet: "and offering the prize of a bit- tersweet crab, a little present from the past" [FW 170.07). Eros reap- pears in Joyce's biblical echo of the feminine, from Eve, the first mother, to Isolde, the Wake's incarnation of the desirable daughter: "she sail eurn bitter bed by thirt sweet of her face!" [FW 291.06). Eros turns bread into bed, and the sweat of the brow into sweetness. Hard work, childbirth, and death await the daughters of Eve after the ex- pulsion from paradise. Joyce's sentence recalls the mother's death in Ulysses, her revenant, and the mystery of love. The Extremes of Eros In "The Individual as Object of Love in Plato," Gregory Vlastos ex- plores some of the questions that are raised by Plato's accounts of love. 1 In the appendix, "Sex in Platonic Love," Vlastos hig…

in early 2003. It would, however, be an oversimplification to see this death as a hindrance that would have prevented Lacoue- Labarthe from bringing his book to an end. Announced by the publisher in early 2004, it was, ad- mittedly, an unfinished project but one he had never abandoned. In drawing the mythical figure of the writer from the posthumous condition of writing, Lacoue- Labarthe’s brief declaration indicates instead an obstacle, or at least a fundamental difficulty—that of myth, to which Blanchot was all the more riveted as he sought obstinately to free himself from it. Drawing on archival material, this introduction will strive to sketch out gradually a picture of the stumbling block that contributed to the incomple- tion of this book even before the death of Lacoue- Labarthe. The said archives (which contain preparatory notes as well as correspondence, seminars, and public declarations) offer material of varying but insufficient degrees of com-

against the cliffs and the white foam swept high above them. Argo was spun round as the flood reached her” (2.565–70). But the most interesting portion of the Argonautica, from our perspective, is the entirety of Book 3, the tale of Jason and Medea. This account deals with the initial encounter of Medea, daughter of King Aeetes of Colchis, whom—it is of some significance to note—the gods cause to fall in love with Jason, and so help him obtain the golden fleece. At the very outset Medea is called “something of a witch” (epei doloessa tetuktai [3.89]—doloessa really meaning subtle or wily). Hecate, goddess of the underworld and of witchcraft, has taught Medea the use of magic herbs, and Medea herself has made a magic ointment from the ichor of Prometheus. This helps Jason overcome the various challenges that Aeetes puts to him—the serpent’s teeth that, when sown, spring up as soldiers, fi…

Introduction N JOHANN WOLFGANG GOETHE’S Prometheus, an early dramatic fragment (1773), Pandora rushes into the arms of her father, Prometheus, and breathlessly reports that she has witnessed what must have been sexual intercourse between her friend Mira and Mira’s lover Arabar in an open meadow. Pandora is overwhelmed by what she has seen — Mira’s initiation into womanhood — and by the nameless, vicarious passion ignited in her- self. “Er küßte sie tausendmal,” she reports. “Und hing an ihrem Munde, / Um seinen Geist ihr einzuhauchen.” Alarmed by Pandora’s outcry, Arabar had fled and left Mira to exhaust her still live desire in Pandora’s embrace, who remains aflame with excitement. “Was ist das alles,” the girl asks her father, “was sie erschüttert / Und mich?” Prometheus answers with one of the oldest of conceits, “Da ist ein Augenblick, der alles erfüllt. / Alles, was wi…

The ravaged landscape that the poet describes here, this ‘lande du sens’, recalls T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land. Bonnefoy writes: ‘C’est comme si le feu avait pris feu, / Et ce second brasier, dépossession, / Comme s’il prenait feu encore, dans les hauts / De l’étoffe de ce qui est’ (DL, 65). The fire or the light that revealed the sanctity of existence at the beginning of ‘La Terre’ now consumes itself endlessly, fuelled by nothing other than its own negativity. Bonnefoy suggests that what might have been a home has been turned into a wasteland. Humanity
