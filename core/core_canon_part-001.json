This is already implicit in early work on the primacy of perception, and it is this primacy, together with the consequent emphasis on cor- poreality as productive negativity, that remains at the heart of Merleau- Ponty's account ofmaterial existence as folded flesh. l The aim ofexistential phenomenology as Merleau-Ponty understood it is to return to lived experience before it is written over and objectified by theory. \"The first philosophical act would appear to be to return to the world of actual experience which is prior to the objective world\" in order to \"restore to things their concrete phYSiognomy\" and thereby to under- talce a \"genealogy ofbeing.\"2 For him, this…",

She calls for a “conservationist” approach to the dissemination of photographs that would prevent the public from becom- ing inured to the suffering of others (180). Of course, the rationing of images is not a solution that could ever have been carried out. Indeed, she could not have imagined in 1978 the vast archive of images that would, in a few decades, be instantly available to anyone with a computer and access to the Internet. In Illness as Metaphor, published only one year after On Photography, Son- tag again explores the ethical and persuasive possibilities of the essay—this time to argue against cultural myths and metaphors about illness. If literature frightens patients away from seeking treatment, then her essay serves as a cor- rective.

Spectators are encouraged to identify with the look of the male hero and make the heroine a passive object of erotic spectacle. Mulvey’s concept of the ‘male gaze’ subse- quently became the main talking point of feminist film debate. This chapter begins with Mulvey’s background in the Woman’s Movement and charts her intellectual trajectory from politics to aesthetics. It then goes on to detail her arguments about the male gaze and how film is structured according to male fantasies of voyeurism and fetishism. The chapter will focus on ‘Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema’ but it will also draw on Mulvey’s other essays from Visual and Other Pleasures (1989) and Fetishism and Curiosit…",

      "text": "PREFACE Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak’s answer to the question she poses in the title of her seminal essay “Can the Subaltern Speak?” is a clear “no.” For Spivak, the subaltern, particularly the subaltern as female, lacks or is denied access to the dominant discourse and thus “there is no space from which the sexed subaltern subject can speak” (Spivak 1988, 307). By her claim that the subaltern cannot speak, Spivak actually wants to say that even if the female subaltern tries to speak she is condemned to silence because she has no distinctive voice in which to make herself heard by the dominant discourse (Spivak 1996, 292). Another important point Spivak stresses is that if the subaltern were to make herself heard, then “her status as a subaltern would be changed utterly; she would cease to be subaltern” (ibid., 6).

In Intimate Revolt, Kristeva defines the abject as a notion she develops from her clinical experience and as a symptom of a psychical economy where the separation between the subject and the object is not clear: “which also refers to the archaic rela- tionship of nonseparation with the maternal container: the mother being the primary abject” (2002a, 260). 4.

The question remains if the disadvantages that the symbolic system creates for women would be annihilated by the new symbolic modifications, which open it to self-identification in the name of equality and inclusion. The fourth chapter, “Different Ontologies in Queer Theory,” compares Butler’s ontology of the body as embedded in her queer theory with the naturalist accounts of sexual difference of Elizabeth Grosz and Claire Coleb- rook. First, I focus on Judith Butler’s ontological understanding of the body, in Gender Trouble, which dates from 1990, and Bodies that Matter, which responds to objections in 1993. In Gender Trouble, sexuality is said to give rise to the construction of sexual difference, and gender identity is explained as an outcome of a gendering process. Butler transforms the idea of social",

Whereas in classical Greece, bios (a form of life, or way of living, deﬁned within the political sphere) could be, and systematically was, distinguished from zoe (the simple fact of life, common to animals, men, and gods), in modern society, he ar- gues, bios and zoe became conﬂated, making bare, biological life the very matter of modern politics.

Several published papers join a small pamplet, her 2003 Companion Species Manifesto: Dogs, People, and Significant Otherness. A lthough alluding to her earlier manifesto for cyborgs, the early w riting from this project enacts quite different voices and is offered out o f a very different space—time, for Haraway and for us all.

When she writes about pain, she narrows her focus to the capacity of language to repre- sent the material world—to name objects—eschewing a more complex view of language that includes its social and creative functions. Language about pain fails, in her view, because it cannot identify its object and thus it cannot confer a verifiable reality upon an internal experience. Like physicians, Scarry wants language to name and validate what is real and true. For both, this desire cre- ates the conditions for doubt and indifference. It is also the case, however, that in the second half of The Body in Pain, Scarry complicates her original assertions and describes the paths by which pain, “this most radically private of experiences,” enters cultur…",

Thacker’s recent work on “the horror of philosophy” is influential on this book in several ways. At the root of his work lies not an expansion of central motifs developed by writers in the horror genre, but rather what they tend to leave out, namely, the unthink- able itself, the direct intersection of horror and philosophy.

This is one of the important ques- tions suggested by Sara Ahmed in chapter 12 as she returns to the relation between theory and practice, not to map out a series of programmes but, rather, to understand how emotions work ‘as forms of mediation between knowledge/theory and practice/activism’. This involves a close reading of the emotions. Some emotions that inform feminism may also be implicated in the very power relations that feminism critiques. For example, as Ahmed discusses, feminists’ senses of pain and anger are, for Wendy Brown, emotions that continue to tie feminists to a position of subordination from which they should be moving.

In his elaborate reading of Yosef Yerushalmi’s Freud’s Moses (and we need to remember that Derrida’s theory of the archive emerges out of a reading of another’s reading of the Freudian archive: his theory of the archive thus takes the form of what he might call a “dangerous supplement” to the thoughts of another), he draws our attention to the etymology of the word “archive,” noting that the term itself means a place of commandment and commencement.

But capitalism, individualism, the collapse of absolutism and the rise of democracy worked to forge new modes of power; specically disciplinary powers that sought to regulate behaviour, movement and thoughts.

She sees these two poles as masculine and feminine respectively: the Symbolic Law of the Father, on one side, and the Semiotic Chora, the felt maternal container, on the other (Révolution), and Doubrovsky uses this dichotomy to explore what he sees as a fundamental split in himself: an ‘insurmounta- ble bisexuality’ (‘L’initiative’, 193).

This art ‘movement’, named as such by the curator and art critic Nicolas Bourriaud, is now ubiquitous. It presents a precise instance of the problem: claiming a contemporary political effi cacy – in the name of Guattari – for ‘an art form where the substrate is formed by inter- subjectivity, and which takes being- together as a central theme’ (Bourriaud 2002: 15). But, Alliez asks, does this ‘inter- subjective substrate’ really represent a break with contemporary forms of subjection, or does it simply produce ‘a populism of the multi- tude, or more exactly a populism of which the multitude would be the (post)aesthetic subject and the object of “re- aestheticisation”?

In keeping with her complex conceptualization of the cyborg as a promising monster that can create spaces of transition, situated knowledge (and passionate detachment) is fundamentally about embodied practice. Thus, in contrast to the ‘God Trick’ of SSK and ANT in which the world is apprehended by a seer who is everywhere and nowhere, for Haraway all knowledge is situated and embodied.

This is, perhaps, one of the most challenging and difficult ethical imperatives underpinning Lévinas’ logic. In other words, even if we reduce the other to an association with the position of the perpetrator, who certainly fails or has failed to see the other’s ‘nudity’, our ethical encounter with the other’s face remains unconditionally predicated on our non-sovereign, un-predetermined, com-passionate hospitality.

For Deleuze, time is multiplicity rather than passage – Aion over Chronos: be it the ‘original time’ of his Proust and Signs (seen in either the invol- untary image of eternity or the actual eternity affirmed in art), the ‘crystal-image’ of time in Cinema 2, the ‘pure and empty form of time’ (Aion) in Difference and Repetition, or the third synthesis of the Nietzschean eternal return, time is one metaphysical element heavily mediated by Deleuze’s theory of the virtual.79 A de-temporalisation of time.

The metaphor which Deleuze and Guattari offered to express desire’s complexity was the ‘rhizome’, a stem of a plant that can produce both roots and shoots. There is a rupture in the rhizome each time the segmentary lines explode into a line of ﬂight, but the line of ﬂight is part of the rhizome. These lines never cease to refer to one another, which is why a dualism or dichotomy can never be assumed, even in the rudimentary form of good and bad. A rupture is made, a line of ﬂight is traced, yet there is always the risk of ﬁnding along it organizations which restratify everything, formations that restore power to a signiﬁer, attributions that reconstitute a subject.

Here, Benjamin misleadingly meditates upon the “decay” (225), the “shriveling” (233), and the “destruction” (240) of what he calls the “aura of art.” Proposing that this aura, or the sense of a work’s uniqueness, is “inseparable from its being imbedded in the fabric of tradition” (225), Benjamin suggests that “the technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition” so that “that which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art” (223).

Grosz's thought of volatile bodies, including but not privileging the human body, is an argument for a differantial relation- ship of nature and technology, body and machine, the virtual and the real. Rather than being in an oppositional or dialectical relationship, nature and technology, body and machine, the virtual and the real are interimplicated; culture is nature deferred, as is technology. Unlike But- ler, Grosz does not treat the body in terms of a radicalized social con- struction. Rather, for Grosz, bodies are given, in the Derridean sense, in specific modalities of materiality, and it is as such that they are en- gaged with cultural inscription devices such as racism, sexism, hetero- sexism, and ethnoce…",

When the parasite causes “perturbations” with his noise, the host attempts to exclude him; but the parasite, playing his position as guest, is “there, well-entrenched,” difficult to exclude because the host has already given him energy (as the reader has given the writer money or, at least, time).

It is one of a potentially infinite number. Bataille posited “the notion of a ‘general economy’ in which the ‘expenditure’ (the ‘consumption’) of wealth, rather than production, was the primary object” (9). By turning classical economics on its head – and empha- sizing all the ways in which organisms and societies are obliged to deal with “the accursed share” (i.e., waste, luxury, excess, and so on) – Bataille widens the frame of Freud’s tautology – “libidinal economy” – to include the entire cosmos. All modes of exchange – whether commercial, gifting, or sacrificial – are underwritten by an erotic exuberance flowing from the energetic mandate of life itself. “[I]t is not necessity,” notes Bataille, “but its contrary, ‘luxury,’ that presents living",

The various ways that the subject deals with its bêtise culmi- nates in different approaches to the text. According to Barthes, it should also be possible to generate a topology of the pleasures of read- ing via the psychoanalytic diagnostic schemas of hysteria, obsessive neurosis, paranoia and perversion (cf. 258/63). The exercise that Barthes suggests here is very interesting, and yet he devotes barely half a page to the various positions that the subject can take with re- spect to the text.

Or as Adorno argues of phi- losophy more generally, “The presentation of philosophy is not an external matter of indifference to it but immanent to its idea.”46 Fortunately for the rhetorically aspiring pessimist, there are a number of aesthetic forms and possibilities that lend themselves to pessimistic per- suasion. Although in the present book we make mention of a few of these, other scholars have already insightfully forayed into this area. Dienstag, for instance, suggests that “aphorisms and pessimism are fitted to one another” and points out that many of the great pessimists have written aphoris…",

Like Grosz, she turns to Deleuze, more specifically to his notion of ‘becoming’, in order to figure this movement. Drawing on images of ‘girls and girls and horses’ and work from Colette and Radclyffe Hall, she is interested in the ‘lines of desire’ that run through these intermingled images and how this way of approaching desire frees us from situating it in one object or reducing it to lack. As she argues: ‘Turning away from the game of matching signifiers to sig- nifieds, we can begin to focus on the movement of images as effecting and affecting movement’ (1996, 59). What is clear in both Grosz’s and Probyn’s Deleuzian refigurings is an emphasis on understanding desire as movement. And this becomes very useful to scholars who want to think of alternative ways to theorise desire. Their figurations, as mentioned earlier, also work to inform projects on Theorising Desire 25",

To say that life is precarious’, she writes, ‘is to say that the possibility of being sustained relies fundamentally on social and political conditions, and not only on a postulated internal drive to live’ (Frames 14).

At the same time, and like the concepts that for Deleuze and Guattari have the power to reconfigure the contours of what they define, the revolu- tionary force of rhythm can be employed to negotiate and expand the territories of human sexuality. Grosz, to whom we have often had reason to return in earlier chapters, has developed the ways in which rhythm and territories function to frame chaos and create intensive nonhuman states. The notion of becoming wolf, which in Deleuze and Guattari’s reading is a way of allowing for multiplicities rather than confining unities, can be engaged to expand the milieus of human and nonhuman territories.

He sees the semiotic per- spective as the most apt at seizing the deep anthropological value of this intertex- tual maze. Flaubert’s Tentation represents a series of temptations; it meta-repre- sents the temptations of the sacred and the paradoxical interplay between the force of creativity and the form of creation, triggering a reflection on its existen- tial meaning. Leone examines these temptations in six steps, revealing that grasping the essence of the temptation Flaubert dealt with means coming to terms with the semiotic nucleus of ritual. (Interpretations by Barthes, Foucault, Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) and the opposition between Flaubert and Nietzsche are of particular relevance.)

The feminist tendency to reduce love to ‘an ideological delusion; an idealized image of (inhibited) sexual desire; or a symbolic or discursive element performing disciplinary power’ (Jónasdóttir, 2014: 19) precluded analyses of love itself, of what it is about love that makes it a vehicle of oppression. It also forestalled a theoretical acknowledgment of love’s liberating potential. Diagnosing the history of feminist perspectives on love, bell hooks argues that it was a mistake that second wave feminists tended to see love itself as the problem. ‘We were to do away with love and put in its place a concern with gaining rights and power’, she remembers. This inhibited the development of a more complex feminist theo- rization of love, inasmuch as ‘[r]ather than rethinking love and insisting on its importance and value, feminist discourse on love simply stopped’ (2000b: 102).

At any point it is a compilation of ‘eating machines, speaking machines, shitting and fucking machines’ (Deleuze and Guattari 2004a, 1); each of these machines feeds upon flows of desire – the desire for, or perhaps rather, the desire that is connection, the desire that is production, the desire that is reproduction.

Despite our present sense of expanding possibilities for gendered em­ bodiment, the melancholic trace in Stephen's experience of herself is im­ possible to wish away.24 Unwanted Being The relationship between gender formation and loss is at the heart of Judith Butler's work on the melancholy of gender.

Although the demonization of human difference—social, sexual, or medical— is clearly an irrational process—hence the deployment of this strategy in the always-irra- tional Gothic text—Susan Sontag provides an explanation, if not a rationale for the impulse. In “AIDS and Its Metaphors,” Sontag explains the slippage by which fear of the illness (or disability) translates into fear of the ill (or disabled) person; the victim thus replaces the condition, becoming the ﬁgure of mystery and murder. Thus the “stigmati- zation of certain illnesses” leads “by extension” to the stigmatization of “those who are ill” (99). Of course, the Gothic mode possesses all the apparatus to present such a human, yet inhuman, monster. 8.

The entanglements that comprise reality emerge and evolve through intra-actions, which are ongoing processes of contingent and shifting materialization. Barad’s account of quantum physics and entanglement describes the imbrication of ontology, epistemology and ethics in all human, and more-than-human, engagements with the world. Entanglement is thus key to what Barad calls ‘ethico-onto-epistemology’ (2007: 90). It not only describes what the world is made of, but conditions how we know (where knowing is inclusive of a broad range of modes of engagement that go beyond human cognition) and implies ethics as constitut…",

She embraces the ethical principle of a‹rmation by putting forward what she calls a “sustainable nomadic ethics.” The concept of nomadism points to an understanding of the self and of the subject as a dynamic process of continuous becoming. In order for that nomadic self to be sustainable, Braidotti argues, the subject needs endurance. Endurance, for her, is joyful a‹rmation as the inherently positive potential of the subject. Thus Braidotti develops a new ﬁgura- tion of living subjectivities in the posthumanist mode.

Moreover, this immanentism is concretised in orthodox Marxist terms, whereby the immanent realm of biopolitical production is a priori viewed as a site of freedom, so that all that is required for the ‘emancipation’ of the multitude is the resistance to the transcendent ‘sovereignty of biopower’. As a result, Hardt and Negri’s emancipatory project comes down to a demand for a ‘biopolitics without sovereignty’, which replicates rather than deconstructs the structure of the Empire.

Yet, this risk is worth taking; in­ deed, to use Levinas’s words, it is “a very fine risk,” which enables us to exit the philosophical discussion of the history of war, aptly characterized by Levinas as “the ontology of totality,” and to confront instead the differends of history. As I have argued, Levinas himself undertakes such a risk in his writings on human rights when he redefines obligation as a struggle for the rights of others. In a more radical way, Lyotard allows us to displace and reinscribe the opposition between his…",

Rather, although the operation of the senses does indeed do that, it is something more primitive than this engagement. It is what is required for that engagement to be controlled by confrontation with the deliverances of experience, rather than simply by the mysterious fulfilment or frustra- tion of our purposes. How is it, though, that sensory experience can reveal something beyond itself?

Logically, this means that there must already be a sense of lack because, from a Lacanian perspective, there can be no desire without lack. Deleuzians would disagree. But for Lacan desire cannot be dissociated from lack. So in the mirror stage there’s an alienation that’s already a lack of sorts. After the mirror stage comes language acquisition, which introduces the notorious Lacanian lack-in-being: the price that all of us pay to enter the symbolic order as socially intelligible (albeit neurotic) creatures. And language—as Žižek likes to remind us— “murders” the Thing, the originary (non)object.25 The result is full- blown desire: the desire to fill the void left by this originary object, which is always a fantasy object in the sense that it never existed.

And, as ­shall be argued throughout this work, they may well be indices of multiplicious semiosis, a dynamics referred to ­here as para-­semiosis. Giving a full account of what para-­semiosis means is the work of Sentient Flesh. The ­thing to keep in mind at this moment is the issue of what the usages of Negro and poiēsis have to do with each other and humanism as designators. The focus ­here is on the relationship between poiēsis and humanism; or rather, it is on a certain history of knowledge that",

These pure-style urges resurfaced in the sixties with a vengeance, curiously enough, in spite of its being such a politically active time. Partly a recurrence of the ideal of “art for art’s sake,” it yet held a political dimension: the revolutionary impulse that had crystallized in the New Left sought for a way to distance itself from the corny, moralizing agitprop of the Old Left. Sontag, nobody’s fool, was well aware that her call to reject interpretation made no sense on practical levels. As she wrote, decades later, in AIDS and Its Metaphors: “[O]f course, all think-",

One will therefore have to examine whether the mode of givenness that signifies this presence in the flesh may be described satisfactorily by Merleau-Ponty’s notion of flesh: Is what the expression Leibhaftigkeit designates already visible or does it, rather, remain in the background to any visibility? We may now return to the feeling of unease mentioned above. Ulti- mately, it comes down to the fact that Merleau-Ponty puts forward a univocal concept of the flesh to which the very distinction between the feeling and the felt—that is to say, intentional distance—appeals.

We replace mod- els of depletion with a recognition of the vital need to rehearse, expand, explore synaptic patterning—a need that is not limited to the survival and aft erlife that Benjamin and Derrida petitioned for in their conception of translation as living on through translational heirs but that goes beyond the implicit death meta- phor to a more generous and generative feminine understanding of the ampli- fi cation that is translation. And so I see it now more clearly: my enduring fascination with translation lies in the fact that it bears witness to the intimately human possibilities of plas- ticity.

Despite the growing popularity that Agamben’s work is currently experiencing, there is little critical material available that would seek to unite his earlier, more literary work with his later philosophical, po liti cal, and theological rumi- nations, such as those centered on the fi gure of the homo sacer, the West- ern legacy of the messianic, the called- for forces of profanation or his development of an ontology of pure potentiality. Lacking this connection, I believe an opportunity is missed, not only to illuminate the overall unity of Agamben’s thought, but also to more fully develop a radical conception of poetics today in relation to the philosophical, as well as the theological.

As an alternative to Levinas, Žižek turns to Primo Levi and his account of the Muselmann, which helps to recast the Other beyond a postmodern Levinasian-inflected ethics. If Žižek criticizes Levinas’s “ethical petrification” (LC, 165) of otherness, he praises Levi’s disclosure of the Other—the Muselmann—a being radically stripped of its symbolic veneer, resistant to the subject’s imaginary projection (the Other as alter ego), and refused the human privilege of intersubjectivity. In contrast to Levinas’s gentrification of the face—what amounts to an imaginary-symbolic Other—Levi portrays the Muselmann as faceless: “When confronted with a Muselmann, one cannot discern in his face the trace of the abyss of the Other in his/her vulnerability, addressing us with the infinite call of our responsibility.

In this way, the transcendental is introduced into the life, disease, and death of the individuals who are caught up in the movement of existence—its current of illness, decline, and very occa- sional recovery. “Horizon,” in its phenomenological force, shows itself as the clue—Husserl would say “the transcendental clue”—to the mean- ing of the substance of The Magic Mountain: the essence of time.

But it is exactly at this point that I would stake my claim for re-visioning the Romantic poetic world of longing. It is true that Freud is Lacan's fodder; but the ways in which he complicates his philosophical father allow us a new path back into the issues of power, sexuality, and expression.

For Amiel-Houser and Mendelson-Maoz, the ethi- cal difficulty is to visualize the other person/character as a “radical alterity, totally exterior and inaccessible” (206) and simultaneously be on their side to help them. However, while interpreting Levinas, they touch upon the fact that the reader/critic might disrespectfully cross the boundaries between himself and what he reads (207). To understand the desired, though not defined as the ideal, state of mind that the new ethical criticism aims to discuss, Gregory’s explanations and remarks about the transforming nature of the reading process are worth referring to. He, in a way, redefines the empathetic identification as a feeling or rather as a reverberating “influ- ence” of the text upon the reader/critic; from the perspective of new ethical criticism, the literary text invites the reader to reformulate what they imitate in the interactive",

This can perhaps be illustrated by examining one of Foucault's central arguments ± that concerning the nature of `reverse' discourses. Following Foucault, it can be argued that as soon as we fight back by formulating `reverse' discourses ± for example, a feminist discourse which challenges assumptions about the inferiority of women to men, or a lesbian and gay discourse which challenges the medical definition of same-sex attraction as a perversion ± we engage with the dominant",

Psychoanalysis provides a starting point for this exploration because, in the words of Marilia Aisenstein, if psychoanalysis is unique, and irreplaceable, in relation to other forms of psychological treatment, it is so, in my view, because it opens up thought processes and enables the subject to reintegrate into the chain of psychic events even something unthinkable, such as the appearance of a lethal illness. (Aisenstein 2006, 679) Psychoanalysis, therefore, offers new ways of thinking about BIID and PLS, two phenomena that are to a great extent, incomprehensible.

By contrast, Nancy Holland offers an account of Jacques Derrida’s discourses of desire across the thirty years of his highly productive career. She shows that at least two different discourses of desire are at work in Derrida’s writings. The first, “male” discourse is discussed in the context of three essays in Writing and Difference (1967); the second, “female” discourse is discussed in the context of Cinders (1980) and Memoirs of the Blind (1990).

In elaborating agential reality, Barad is bringing technology and science studies to bear on feminist theorizing of the body. For Barad bodies arise intra-actionally as phenomenon and therefore intra-actional bodies are not just a matter of shaping the surface of a body or a body’s morphology, as Butler proposed. Barad is taking up the very atoms or the very volume of bodies as non-conscious phenomena, not as a citational iteration but an intra-actional iteration (Barad, 1998: 106).

For Merleau-Ponty then, the world perceives itself by opening itself to the experience of its own difference— the energies, torsions, contrasts, and tensions of its noncoincidence. In its very directness, the intention of this global embrace (invagination) is to seize the essential fullness of Being in all its expressions.

And it is a register that is located at the heart of a self/other relation that is mediated by a feminine relation to otherness. However, while Cixous indicates the signiﬁcance of the self’s relation to its own ‘being’ as a central aspect of this different, feminine economy of desire, her analysis reaches the limits of its poetic extension at this point in ‘Sorties’. Through her reading of Achilles and Penthesileia Cixous establishes some of the conditions upon which a feminine relation to otherness may rest in the con- text of love. Moreover, she clariﬁes the importance of her understanding of the feminine as a way of being rather than as the signiﬁer of an essentially sexed body,",

If we question, or deconstruct, the very basis of our distinctive form of critique, is this deconstruction tantamount to a kind of political quietism? This is a question that is raised by Judith Butler’s rhetorical analyses of gender diﬀerence talk discussed by Colebrook, and Butler’s famous slogan “everyone is in drag.” Thomas Docherty discusses this problem in terms of the infusion of ideas from literary criticism into social theory, especially in the form of Jacques Derrid…",

Kruks quite rightly concludes that for Merleau-Ponty “the body is not . . . a ‘short cut’ to a common ground,” but rather a “source of its possibility” (42, 37), and this is precisely the position being supported in the present paper. Embodiment as existential dimen- sionality creates the possibility of communication and the various levels of violence of intersubjectivity as well. 40.

In the chapter “Docile Bodies” in Discipline and Punish, trans. Alan Sheridan (New York: Vintage, 1977), Michel Foucault writes: “The first of the great operations of discipline is, therefore, the constitution of ‘tableaux vivants,’ which transform the confused, useless or dangerous multitudes into ordered multiplicities” (148). 3.

Subjectivity is out of the picture and, with it, a sustained political analysis of the posthuman condition.”29 We will return to the intersections of contemporary feminism and posthumanism in chapter 4. At present, I want to underline how Braidotti’s counterthesis encapsulates the signiﬁ- cantly different project shared by many scholars associated with feminist materialist critiques of technoscience. Braidotti advocates for a conceptual framework that includes, as she puts it, “both scientiﬁc and technological complexity and its implications for political subjectivity, political econ- omy and forms of governance.”30 In short, (technological and scientiﬁc) matter and (social) meaning cannot be separated. What is essential to grasp is that feminist new materialists like Braidotti (and her like- minded artist peers) work both through and against the larger new material…",

Pandora is overwhelmed by what she has seen — Mira’s initiation into womanhood — and by the nameless, vicarious passion ignited in her- self. “Er küßte sie tausendmal,” she reports. “Und hing an ihrem Munde, / Um seinen Geist ihr einzuhauchen.” Alarmed by Pandora’s outcry, Arabar had fled and left Mira to exhaust her still live desire in Pandora’s embrace, who remains aflame with excitement. “Was ist das alles,” the girl asks her father, “was sie erschüttert / Und mich?” Prometheus answers with one of the oldest of conceits, “Da ist ein Augenblick, der alles erfüllt. / Alles, was wi…",

Thus the monstrous-feminine that Creed (1993) notes as ubiquitous in horror texts may relate to more than the monstrousness of the archaic mother (which Creed opposes, in somewhat traditional gender-categorization, to the “law of the father”). The growing, older child excited and alarmed by Hansel and Gretel pushing the wicked witch into the oven may be reworking early encounters with the abhorrent mother but may as well be looking for imagery powerful enough to contain his or her abundant aggression around restrictions on autonomy or insults to self-regard, or may be anxious to explore life’s awful and marvelous possibilities. Also important in conjecture about infantile experience is the awareness that later childhood and adult experience of trauma can lead to emotion and imagery",

They argue that, like Narcissus, the novel began to lose those attractive features-of action, of personality- which had made it so beloved (in the last century) to become absorbed in a deeper self-reflective state which- and herein lay the fear- threatened to deny the novel's existence as a realistic narrative of something outside itself.

For if, as the title’s medical metaphor (Spleen) implies, the hidden figure of the city (de Paris) mediates the symptoms of a social body afflicted by alienated relations of class, gender, and race, it can be said that that city is in pain. Such an assertion presupposes that the poems encode a body at once indi- vidual and collective, biological and artifactual; a body whose urban identity is not only a construction but also a precondition of the text’s images of social and political malaise.

Yet, even if Scheler thinks the mutual penetration of life and spirit, for him the issue of this mutual penetration is the enlivening of spirit and not the return of thinking to its bodily origins.

Thus, by approaching literature through philosophy, Blanchot is renewing this double problem by which thinking can only proceed by way of its involvement with writing, which will prevent it from ever being fully defined, and writing, because it proceeds by way of thinking, will be exposed to the implications that this transformed thinking will now bring to writing.

Rather, Barthes’s study proposes a sort of structural anthropology of the Racinian world, as he analyses the signifying system underlying each of the plays. He ﬁnds in them a consistent setting – the antechamber posed between an inner sanctuary and the outside world – and a consistent set of charac- ters playing out variants of what Barthes describes as a ‘fundamental relationship’ (la relation fondamentale). He provocatively represents this relationship in the form of what he calls ‘a double equation’: A has all power over B. A loves B, who does not love A.9 Pushing the analysis ever further, Barthes shows how Racine’s plays revolve around the same drama of authority, involving the father and his son, the king and his subject, and ultimately God and his creature. Even on this cursory account of new critical readings of Racine, it should be apparent how very different they are in tone and content Impostures of French theory 13",

The representation of the wounded and painful part of the body Let us emphasize that such a connection of causes inducing corporeal pain evokes that which presides at the formation of the psychical pain. We see that the logical schemas accounting for these two forms of pain are almost identical. However, one of their differences resides in the imaginary contents of the hypertrophic representation.14 Indeed, while for corporeal pain the rep- resentation refers to a wounded body, psychical pain refers to an object that has been loved and lost (a person, a thing, or a value).

She argues instead for a theorization of the body that accounts for both its social and its psychic formation, for both the inscription of its external surface and the production of its internal, psychical operations. The body is, therefore, central in the formation of individual identity and is the site of the subject’s desires and fantasies, actions and behaviour.

But, in terms of ﬁlm practice, cinema also owns the objects and characters that it manifests in its images. Thus, the experience in cinema is double: ‘the ﬁlmgoer’s experience of the ﬁlm, and the ﬁlm’s experience of its characters and objects’ (Frampton, 2006: 41).

In Jane Kilby’s analysis of how sexual trauma is ‘an unethical transgression of a skin boundary’, she oﬀers an understanding of skin as testimony. However, rather than suggesting that skin speaks, that it simply has a voice that can be heard by others, she suggests that the skin must be read, and that it is the reader who must embody the possibility of skin as testimony. In a close analysis of Louise Pembroke’s drawings about self-harm, Kilby shows how the self-harm testimony appears to deny any form of communication and dialogue.

This, I would concede, is an existential “crisis” of potentially formidable proportions. If desire results from the foundational lack caused by the signifi er, the drives persist as a surplus of enjoyment that continues to bubble up into the symbolic, allowing remnants of the real to seep into the domain of signifi cation and sociality in a highly explosive manner.

The following is a central trajectory for the narrative texts to be discussed. Femininity and death cause a disorder to stability, mark moments of ambivalence, disruption or duplicity and their eradication produces a recuperation of order, a return to stability. The threat that death and femininity pose is recuperated by representation, staging absence as a form of re-presence, or return, even if or rather precisely because this means appeasing the threat of real mortality, of sexual insufficiency, of lack of plenitude and wholeness.

In that session Derrida returns to Sigmund Freud, following the red thread of blood as philosophy – and here psychoanalysis – shows itself to be unable to oppose the death penalty. Locating anxiety regarding the flow of blood, Freud finds himself turning his discussion of the defloration of women into one of female resentment born of penis envy (that is not the surprise). What is striking but, again, not surprising is Freud’s twofold transition from the so-called ‘primitive’ peoples to his contemporary moment (itself a familiar synthesis from his colonial orchestration of the Subject of Europe in his speculative writings).13 Firstly he locates the clearest instances of such resentment among ‘the strivings and in the literary productions of “emancipated” women’ in his",

In pondering how I might go about this task, I've come to realize— albeit with the clarity of hindsight—that my work has been shaped by a rather bruising intellectual itinerary. The result is by no means a happy amal- gam of insights gleaned from desultory studies in different academic depart- ments. It is, I suspect, much more a response to the sort of blustering hostility that my questions have so often occasioned. The vehemence of this hostility has sometimes been bewildering.

We illustrate how such concepts have been employed by critical phenomenologists, especially Kelly Oliver and Alia Al-Saji, to articulate a critical account of ethical vision.

Braidotti charts the conflicting possibilities for the future enabled by what her essay explores as the 'teratological' imaginary. Elizabeth Grosz, whose work on Deleuze and the body has already transformed feminism, now uses Deleuze to address the question of transformation itself. For Grosz, the issue presented by Deleuze has moved from the specificity of bodies and desires, to the movement of the virtual. Grosz's argument is not a straight- forward uncovering of a project or deep meaning in Deleuze's texts. Rather, Grosz weaves her own reading of Bergson back through Deleuze's use of Bergson to ask whether there might be a politics of the future. Given the ostensible demise of the emancipationist",

I examine the ways in which Adorno confronts a seminal problem in the philosophical interpretation of art: Without the intervention of theoretical or philosophical discourse, the conceptual dimension of an artwork would remain incomprehensible. But if the com- mentator succeeded fully in articulating and interpreting the conceptual truth content of the artwork, this success also would have made the art- work itself superfluous. After all, what the artwork represents and achieves in its singular way could be replaced by discursive logic. One of the themes that a reading of The Trial therefore should emphasize is the very way in which a literary text both calls for philosophical interpretation and resists such interpretation at the same time. This double gesture of calling forth and resisting philosophical interpretation, while shared by all great literary …",

In one passage, she picks up on the ‘other’ unpublished image that structures Camera Lucida (upon which few com- mentators remark), the image of Jerome, Napoleon’s cousin, which Barthes tells us sparked his desire to find out what photography is.

It is less a space of “absolute beauty” than a moment in a complex semiotic and textual weave, in which the maternal, the feminine, and a vibrant, pulsating material world offer occasions for reﬂection, enjoyment, and life, for the writing of a new world that stands not in opposition to the present, not as its negation, but as the unveiling of all that must be repressed in order to constitute that present.

I would argue, therefore, that Joyce and Proust do take up this masculine trait of playing with themselves in language, but for a different reason. Bloom and Marcel are left to play out their desires ‘alone’ in language because, for them, the ‘sexual relation’ is also impossible. However, Joyce and Proust detail an alternative act of union through their play with language that offers the potential for sharing a desire that remains immanent to itself. The nourishment that is offered to the reader, and the prospective reading that nourishes the writer, are grounded on a desire for the word that can be shared.

Famously, Merleau-Ponty translates Edmund Hus- serl’s notion of the “lived body” (Leib) as the shared “ﬂ esh of the world” (la chair du monde).34 The translation emphasizes the co-implication of the affective registers of touch and sight in an enveloping network of chias- tic exchanges between “the sensing and the sensed.”35 Such intertwin- ing expresses the intercorporeal drama that Merleau-Ponty also calls the “topology of being.”36 For Merleau-Ponty, the topological image es- chews allegiance to a ﬁ xed Archimedean point of sovereign rationality or its attendant scientistic trappings of instrumental objective knowledge. Merleau-Ponty’s topology instead endorses an incarnate rationality that replaces data-driven notions of “concept, idea, mi…",

By trying to stay aware—in a hyperreflection—of the alterations that thought introduces in the experience of brute Being I pointed to a shift in the directionality of Merleau-Ponty’s thought in that passage. First he describes the perceiver’s coming to herself as sensible, and then the perceiver experiences that from which she first emerged as an ex- tension of her own flesh. How are we to interpret these alterations of thought?

The authors’ pursuit of a shape for the clutter does not deny its disorganization in search of better working genres for endurance, relationality, and world-remagnetizing but becomes a practice of living on, of life itself.

Indeed, it is not the sequence alone that must be rendered heterogeneously: images, impressions and sensations are to be rendered as they are in themselves, ‘multiples et différentes’ (RTP4, 467; SLT6, 245). Art actually registers or produces a multiplication of worlds, since it is faithful to ‘la différence qu’il y a dans la façon dont nous apparaît le monde’ (RTP4, 474; SLT6, 254).

Indeed, if one wants a sense of ‘what it is like to be a thing’ vis-à-vis human perception, asking about such objec- tification is a good place to start. Drawing on feminist phenomenological analyses of embodied knowledge, I suggest that those who learn ‘first and best’ how to live as objectified often know what it is to ‘withdraw’ from the perceptions and conceptualisations of another, to exceed the distortions and caricatures of knowers engaged in the sort of project of access Harman (and others) worry about. Although I do not propose that objectification is wholly equivalent to Harman’s ‘respect’ for objects, I do propose it both as a ‘gateway’ and as a cautionary account revealing that how we are with and as objects is at least as important as what we theorise objects to be. There are particular epistemological and ontological risks that arise when human beings attend to objects, and those risks shift, but do not disperse, when",

Next, Dick allows the rich dynamics of human psy- chology to come into play, exploring states that include empathy, projection, and schizoid alienation while subtly deconstructing any strict opposition between human and android. In fact, the emotional resonances of the scenes often stem from the realization on the part of the main character (and the reader) that genuine feelings and respect for others do not line up with and cannot be predicated on this opposition. Indeed, Dick’s importance for this article lies precisely in how compellingly he renders the android, and how he makes its appearance in the human world seem inevitable, following the developments of cybernetics and electronics.8 As a writer, Dick is not that interested in exploring the possibility of either",

Proust’s hermetically sealed novel In Search of Lost Time is itself one of the dominant monads of Western culture. Complete interiorisation has been attained in the work of art, since it is the product of a pure manipulation of the ‘free materials of nature’ in the service of an Idea. It is possible that Deleuze and Guattari’s attack on the notion that it is possible to ‘extrapolate’ a transcendent object from the process of desire originates in Deleuze’s Proustian analysis of the experience of love. Deleuze and Guattari’s tendency to give primacy to desire therefore cannot be said to arise out of a radicalisation of the classical Freudian distinction between the ‘object’ and ‘aim’ of desire (SE 14, 122).

The maternal body itself is full of alterity and negation. And the prototype for symbolic negation is the experience of birth. I describe the child's abject relation to its mother as a relation to its own birth. In the third chapter I develop a reading of Kristeva's imaginary father in order to recuperate this concept for feminist theory.

Among the range of implied “hows” are matters tropological (how, for instance, does the period’s literature articulate desire through the motif of economy?); contextual (how do fully-­embodied eco- nomic phenomena relate to literary representations of sex, pleasure, and desire?); and formal (how do fin-de-siècle writers deploy poetic/narrative/ metrical economy to articulate various forms of “unacceptable”—often ­homoerotic—desire?).

For it becomes clear in Malabou’s work that to remain absolutely attached, to refuse the movement and migrations of plasticity, is to remain a deluded master, one who paralyzes the movement of thought, bodies, ways of being, and knowing. Rather, Malabou’s thought powerfully evinces the ethos that it is incumbent on philosophy to become passionate, to detach from itself, to “suffer” and and let itself be shaped by that which solicits or challenges it to become otherwise than it is or has been.

Max’s symptoms of not climaxing, constipation, and perpetual thinking made more sense when they were connected to Max’s own “elimination” and his desire to simultaneously retain his sense of self and to hold back or stave off death. A focus on the existential given of death anxiety (never to be underestimated) is fleshed out in relation to the obsessional mode or form of the neurotic’s question, particularly as it manifested in Max’s symptoms, dreams, ego identifications, and our therapeutic relationship. Why was Max’s existence so inextricably tied to death? Within his family, we uncover a “symbolic debt” in the form of a death of which no one spoke; the repressed in the form of a family secret returns in Max’s being.

For Nietzsche, this development had speciﬁc implications for historio- graphy.

In addition, in some ways the last three chapters consist of echoes or aftereffects of this central reading, as creation is implicated in God, the Real, and Substance. Throughout the entire book, the theme of sublimation persists, even if it becomes less obvi- ous, although even sublimation is subordinated to the sublime, which goes by multiple names, including God, the Thing, the Other, the Real, and Substance.

Yet here this type of material sublimity carries over to the textual and the aesthetic as well since “human words and marks share space with the nonhuman page and once uttered aloud, they take shape in not-exclusively human sounds, sounds made manifest by contingent collaborations of earth, air, verse, and versifier.” By rethinking aesthetics in the light of such nonhuman agencies, the romantic sublime thus becomes, in Speitz’s hands, more than anthropocentric terror—boundless ecology and ontology. Her essay, then, has powerful ethical implications. Indeed, her study of romantic aerography and acoustics underscores how “romantic affect and aesthetics can dampen",

But this intrusion of Blanchot also designates a difference within the text itself that causes Deleuze’s book to change course. I want to show that Deleuze’s use of Blanchot helps him to seal off a line of flight that, in reality, traverses the entire organization (dispositif) of the time-image and calls into question the possibility of inscribing the image in time.

Through the juxtaposition of Levinas’s ethics of responsibility and Kristeva’s ethics of “the irreconcilable,” I develop a psychoanalytic model of ethical relation to the Other, irreducible either to the narcissistic reflection of the ego Ideal or to the fetishistic em­ bodiment of the abject in social relations. By pushing Kristeva’s and Levinas’s ethics toward their limits, I define such a model as the interplay be­ tween the sublimation of the death drive and the confrontation with the ab­ ject as one’s own most intimate yet inassimilable alterity. By rethinking the conditions of ethical responsibility in the context of the libidinal economy of the drive, I contest the separation of ethics not only from embodiment and sensibility but also from conflict and sexuality. Kristeva’s ethics of democracy is crucial for und…",

To conceive of one signifying framework that could account for the numerous sensations and attendant contextual elements (instruments used, accompanying music or locations, clothing to reveal or hide the wounds, and so on) is to remain bound to a repressive and institutionalized schema that seeks to co-opt and control any body that refuses to adhere to the standardized codes of the human. The multiplicity of meanings that surround self-harm, in the social sphere and the realm of personal experience, may be evoked through the scene in The Piano Teacher in which Erika, sitting on the side of the bath, cuts her genitals in a gesture that is presented as a habitual act of mutilation. Furthermore, this scene enacts a dovetailing of self-mutilation and masochism in its emphasis upon a key point of interconnection betwee…",

Because Merleau-Ponty does not identify a point of birth and separation for the subject, the visible world becomes like the interior of the maternal body to which the subject has unencumbered tactile access. The subject never really sees what lies outside the sensory network of the ﬂesh in which she or he is immersed, and therefore cannot see the other and the world from outside an egocentric position. The ﬂesh is a totalizing structure that reafﬁrms the subject’s centrality in the world through bodily perception. Perception occurs within a ‘fog’ or ‘mist’ of the seer’s intentions, and the subject …",

Language represents an effort to control through representation the traumatic separation that one must inevita- bly undergo; it is therefore always restless with desire for a presence it can only symbolize but never achieve. Because language is predicated upon the pain of absence, pain is inseparable from the pleasures of signiﬁcation. But emphasizing that pain underlying signiﬁcation—representing the gaps in language rather than representing that which is desired— offers the distinct pleasure of foregrounding the presence of language itself. One might prefer the representation of maternal absence to pres- ence, sunset to sunrise, pain to pleasure because it makes one conscious of the fact that one actually has language at hand (or a spool in hand).

In this sense, Henry notes, Biran’s account of affectivity and other passive phenomena is “strangely” like the account of Descartes in his treatise on the passions: they depend on (are brought about by) something that lies beyond the sphere of immanent subjectivity, namely, on mere extension. Henry’s own remedy is to view both passivity and activity as grounded in a deeper foundation of corporeal subjectivity, a more fundamental “power” (1965, 225) that is alive not just when one moves effortfully but also when one is passively influenced. Henry speaks here of a “latent tension” experi- enced in the body, which is the “essence” of feeling and affectivity, as well as of active motor effort; this tension is “the proper interior quivering of knowing” (le propre frémissement intérieur du savoir), where this know- ing is “a life, not a dead knowing” (1…",

It seems important to be clear about what my interpretive strategies are and to what sort of interpretive authority I appeal. Susan Sontag, in her essay “Against Interpretation,” argues, as the title suggests, against interpreting works of art. Her idea is that most interpretations start with some kind of theory—Freudian Theory, Feminist Theory, Lacanian Theory, Jungian Theory—and then force the artwork into the box of the theory and thereby do terrible vio­ lence to the artwork, even killing it. I love theories and have many of my own, but I take Sontag’s point and I know just what she means about the violence a theory can do to a beautiful movie, say. At the end of her essay, however, she calls for an “erotics of interpretation.”3 I really like …",

This is a highly complex thematic, with numerous (disseminated) authors and texts involved or embroiled from Alfred Jarry’s ‘oulipian grammatology’ (Tufail 1999: 122ff.) to Mallarmé (Temple 1999) to Baudelaire and Valéry (Robbins and Wolfreys 1999), and beyond. Again here, however, my focus will be specifically on Artaud. As Brannigan argues persuasively (Brannigan 1999b: 55), there is a powerful series of intellectual and theoretical resonances between Derrida and surrealism (here Artaud being seen as a ‘dissident’ surrealist).

The important diﬀerence is that whereas in Barthes’s account we ended with the exhibition’s ideological postulation of ‘‘a human essence,’’ in Fish’s essay we end with ‘‘a psychological unity.’’ The rub here is that in criticism on, say, lyric poetry, ‘‘a psychological unity’’ can do, and does do with regularity, much the same work as ‘‘a human essence.’’ The unity posited in the case of each poem may be diﬀerent (it is this diﬀer-",

The central thesis of Barthes's article is the notion of icriture, or writing. It is claimed that in the process of writing, any voice or point of origin is wiped out, so any appeal to the author to clear up misunder- standings is useless. The author is just not there any more. Writing, rather, is the neutral space where our own identity vanishes, and the function of the symbol takes over. In other words: when the author 'dies', writing (icriture) is born. This is not only baffling, it is also counter- intuitive. That the very act of writing wipes out the writer is clearly meant metaphorically, but this is still a tall order.

Perhaps the most indecent thing for Derrida is the recognition that these mourning essays constitute a genre. If all these heartfelt acts of mourning belong to a genre, then the poi- gnancy seems conventional rather than authentic. The generic na- ture of these memorials was foregrounded when they were col- lected together and published as a book; reading this collection, the previous chapter focused on the generic, on issues posed by this genre. The present chapter continues our exploration of this ethi- cally problematic and theoretically invaluable genre. We turn here to two memorial essays by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick.

On the other end of the continuum, con- temporary representations of the body in performance art, in consensual sadomasochism, and in female saints are discussed as attempts to use pain and pleasure to reconnect with the feeling self. Chapter ﬁve concludes the book by suggesting that practices of mindfulness such as vipassana or tonglen forms of Buddhist meditation represent ways for us to come to our senses and live fully aware in the present. These spiritual practices increase so- matic, emotional, and mental awareness, reuniting mind and body in ways that counteract habitual conditioning and allow us to live in permeable space. Just as Grandin came to experience connec- tions with others through the embrace of the squeeze machine, mindful attention to ordinary bodily acts such breathing and eat- ing can lead us to feel the self’s “emptiness” or fundamental inter- relatedness with other selves.

Nevertheless, there is always a nagging impression that one can push through “some Membrane” to “the other side of something” (M&D, 188) or achieve invisibility like Vaucanson’s automaton Duck—vibrating itself into a higher order of being, moving from mechanized inertia towards independence (see M&D, 378–9).

There, I stage an encounter between Kristeva and her feminist interlocutors, and I extrapolate some of her key concepts that have been particularly inﬂ uential within the feminist reception of her work. These include her distinction between the semiotic and the symbolic, her notion of the subject-in-process, her engagement with psychoanalysis and her account of corporeality.

From the cryptic suffering and violence of the obscene there is always a chance of re- turning with a clearer recognition of the eventual necessity of a lan- guage of gentleness and consideration.

In terms of various body parts and various bodies capable of various kinds of expression, the collective value would be understood in terms of the differences inscribed in or on the body.

For Kristeva, signifiance is a question of positioning. The semiotic continuum must be split if signification is to be produced. This splitting (coupure) of the semiotic chora is the thetic phase (from thesis), enabling the subject to attribute differences and thus signification to what was the ceaseless heterogeneity of the chora. Following Lacan, Kristeva posits the mirror phase as the first step that permits 'the constitution of objects detached from the semiotic chora' (p. 100 below), and the Oedipal phase with its threat of castration as the moment in which the process of",

There Deleuze alludes to the revolutionary side of three women filmmakers, Chantal Akerman, Marguerite Duras and Agnes Varda. The repertoire is less ‘classical’ or ‘popular’ than, as with his choice of literature, anti-consumption. Deleuze deals with an anti-cinema that does not give the spectator the easy satisfaction of consuming images or of identifying with the screen.

Jane Bennett has recently asked, “Why did Foucault’s concern with ‘bodies and pleas- ures’ . . . not count as materialist? Why is there not a more robust debate between . . . contending accounts of how materiality matters to politics?”8 Lingis suggests the same rhetorical question.

Today, philosophy seems to be taking a similar path in reaction against the bombastic, noisy ideologies of the twentieth century, preferring to take inspiration from the god of small things (to cite a perhaps too-​familiar title) in search of elusive meanings that broaden our mental horizons (Borsari, 1992). The final section of an essay in philosopher Remo Bodei’s, The Life of Things, The Love of Things (2009), on the many aesthetic and epistemological pathways that objects induce us to pursue, demonstrates the way in which this philosophical approach can become almost an ethical program: Life’s brevity and the chance circumstances of birth, which enclose every individual into a limited space and time, permit …",

In the history of feminist theory it has been the starting place for feminist interventions: the starting point that asks the question about the authority of judgements made without the recognition of gender difference. Just as important is the identification of the male with the human today: in the work of Judith Butler we can perceive the way in which the ‘trou- ble with gender’ became the starting point for Butler’s determination to refuse the resolu- tion of the question by Beauvoir (identification with the male) by constructing an account of gender that disallowed the presence of gender as anything other than a learned (and repeated) performative practice. Indeed, Butler’s account of gender renders it as a fiction in which achieved gender status is a fiction rather than an absolute state supported by fic- tion, which is the case in the work of Beauvoir.",

Philosophers and scientists alike have traded, without acknowledgement, on the essential carnality of this sense. In his commitment to making a radical break with the privilege given to objective thought as the basis of knowledge Merleau-Ponty does not subordinate vision to other senses. Instead, he includes it in a general account of perception whose structuration defies reduction to disembodied or objective modes of consciousness. For this reason, Merleau-Ponty’s work, with its insistence on the primacy of perception and, in later work, its questioning of the relationship between perception and language, offers itself as a unique interrogation and reint…",

With Michel Serres’s universal humanism (Chapter 5) the argument returns to the question of host capacities in order, finally, to go beyond it. Rather than Badiou’s and Meillassoux’s determinate capacity for thought and rather than Malabou’s meta-capacity of plasticity, Serres seeks to elab- orate a figure of the human that accommodates both determinate qualities (like Badiou and Meillassoux) and de-differentiation (like Malabou).

Hughes notes that the women mystics remedy this blind spot by setting the divine-human relation in the context of intimate love, which includes the body and the world of human-human relations in a more robustly incarnate vision. However, where the fulﬁllment of this divine- human love relation seems to ultimately eclipse the integrity of the human (woman) partner, and with it the embodied world, Hughes ar- gues that the work of Cixous can function as a theologically fruitful sup- plement. Cixous may offer a vision of an embodied apophatic of intimate love that preserves the embodied integrity of both partners while render- ing a poetics that might inform the speech of theology.

Deleuze objects that each section is in fact mobile so that movement is not added to immobile sections because, even though every shot is fixed, spatial, and immobile, the means by which the shot becomes cinema, namely the projector, constitutes…",

Here, bodies are no longer assumed simply to be given in and to the world but are rather understood as both the locus of thinking – the site from which thinking takes place – and as the object of thought – as being already subject to interpretation and conceptualisation. As Elaine Scarry has shown in The Body in Pain, the interfaces between bodies and their worlds are made and unmade through social practices, the pain of which may shatter language and defy its representational potential (1985: 5). Thus the practices of thinking are not separated from the realm of the body but are implicated in the passion, emotions and materiality that are associated with lived embodiment. The task of Thinking Through the Skin is, at one level, to continue the feminist project of taking bodies seriously as both the subject and object of thinking.",

T HE P RO B LE MATI C S OF T HE F LES H Phenomenology is often associated with the notion of embodiment, and this is largely due to the considerable inﬂuence of Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s writings. In the 1960s, that theorist’s Phenomenology of Perception (1945) and The Visible and the Invisible (1959) had a profound impact on artists, critics, and art historians, particularly in the United States. Though since then other theorists of phenom­ enology have come to the foreground of the discipline, his work still poses a number of ethical challenges that are worthwhile considering further.3 Merleau-Ponty initiated a line of questioning on the a priori conditions of perception. He hypothesized that perception is founded on a pre-objective awareness of oneself as interwoven in a network of sense with other people, ob…",

On a deeper level, however, the ‘schizophrenic existence’ posited by Held, if embraced in a non-dual fashion, could perhaps be seen as the most non-dual and integrated stance possible for women in present society, since it is the only one at one with the position that women occupy. The female position as we know it is constituted by severe contradictions, however half-real one set of their poles is.

I use the plural of 'masculinities' throughout this book to indicate that there is not one single 'masculinity' analysed here, but a range of different representations of masculinity. In analysing masculinities in film, I have particularly found models worthy of emulation in Steven Cohan's Masked Men (1997) and Robert Corber's In the Name of National Security (1993), which look at Hollywood cinema in the 15 years following World War 2.

It stands to reason, therefore, that the story implicitly but not very ambiguously makes a case for male-gazing, as not merely biologically determined or socially conditioned—as something that, in Mulvey’s view, men do to women—but as an artistic resource and perspectival option. According to New Yorker theater critic Hilton Als, “few feminists have articulated the ways in which some women may find stereotypical male behavior necessary, if only because it enables them to act out its sup- posed counterpart, femininity.” Als’ reasoning echoes the understanding of gazing voiced by Cather. If we must, as the prevailing wisdom argues, treat “femininity” and masculinity as gender-producing performances rather than genetically coded identities, then male-gazing belongs to this larger repertory of gender-making and gender-bending performances and opportunities for exploring and staging the effects of desire both",

Its first two sections investigate the objective functional system of objects and their ‘subjective’ system, then the fascination of gadgets and robotics, and finally, the socio-ideological system of objects and consumption. It is thus important to be clear about the overall argument of the book. The first two sections attempt to analyse, first, changes in practices of interior design starting from the point of view of the arrangement of furniture and of interior ‘ambience’, then the ‘antique’ and other special collections. The third section is concerns the ‘meta-system’ and the ‘dysfunctional’ system. This section, though short, has a valuable statement as a recapitulation of the main themes of the book, which explicitly draws on the ideas of Barthes and shows how they were put to work. This statement suggests that, after analysing objects in thei…",

Bennett’s project is also explicitly tied to human activity and ethical engagement while extending the powers of free action and a quasi-agency through a robust ontological framework that deepens the autonomy of objects. Using the tension between disenchantment and re-enchantment as a starting point, I want to expand Bennett’s and Schmitz’s insights to develop an ontologically oriented understanding of aesthetic wonder. Like Bennett, Jeffrey Kosky’s project is oriented toward re-establishing enchantment in a disenchanted world. In Arts of Wonder, Kosky details how the intersection of art and religion can help to re-establish enchant­",

Where the foundational fantasy is concerned, there is a strange and interesting departure in this new work, and it has to do with the way in which you speak of the function of affects. Affects, you suggest are themselves forms of egoic, comparative judgments that one makes about an object. When one feels envy, anger, deprivation or self pity, one is adopting a judgmental stance towards the object.

For Fisher, the interjection of cyberspace does not create, but supplements the current dismal reality as a mirror of the austere times and corroded imagination of its world subjects.

I argue that in their work the maternal body occupies the site of similitude and identity. Returning to Kristeva I suggest that her depiction of women’s writing as derivative reinforces an Oedipal scenario where women are reduced to the status of daughters who faithfully desire to reproduce their fathers’ words. Against this I gesture toward writing by women that displaces this masculine coupling. I complete the chapter with a discussion of the attempt, in Irigaray’s work, to theorise mothers and daughters as speaking subjects who do more than simply repeat the same. I conclude the book by returning to a question that runs throughout the work, the question of the place of women’s writing. Here I return to the spatial metaphors wi…",

What, however, is of special interest to me is a particular kind of omission, description, or trivialization (these categories, as we might expect, ultimately overlap [see BP 69–70])—a technique whose pretence is, precisely, that it does not dismiss the body but brings vividly to light the repellent nature of physical violence. Central to this particular type of sublime is a perceptual process identical in structure to that which Scarry locates in specific acts of violence—in torture, as we shall see in chapter 4, and in war, whose inner “logic” preoccupies me here.

It may be noted that Barthes' work on narrative, similarly, is concerned with the structural conventions that a story must obey, if, paradoxically, it is to appear to the reader as if it was unfolding, not according to a convention, but rather naturally (Barthes 1977b). In Mythologies, in particular, Barthes analyses the way in which a second, 'mythological', level of meaning is added onto signs. The signs under investigation are not only linguistic signs, but also any carriers of meaning, including photographs and other visual images. Myth, for Barthes, works by allowing a particular image to reinforce our preju- dices, making them appear to have universal validity.

Ainley is right to point to how the semiotic and transgressive aspects of the speaking being disrupts the law, but Kristeva thinks the symbolic and law-abiding aspect of being a speaking being is vital as well.

[PSA] COMPLEXITY THEORY The world is full of complex systems, from the internal structure of single-celled organisms to the working of the stock exchange. Complexity theory has attempted to define these ‘self-organizing’ systems, and then to find the general principles that underlie them, with the goal of producing a unified law of complexity. Although the search for a unified law betrays a deep-seated reductionist bias, there is also a counterbalancing holism in that the behaviour of",

The benefit of such an approach, apart from correspond- ing more closely to biophysical, biocultural and biodigital reality, is that it recognises the body as a mutating force and emphasises its ‘thousand modes of sex and reproduction’ (Parisi 2004: 197). Parisi’s project, heavily influenced by Spinoza as well as by Deleuze and Guattari, thus opens for ways of rethinking what bodies are and what they can do, and indeed, she argues herself, for acknowledging ‘new cultures and new species’ and ‘the proliferation of a new nature",

Following a Lacanian framework, feminist ﬁlm theorists have developed an account of a female experience of pleasure in the objectiﬁed female body within a patriarchal order. The story goes something like this.6 Subjectivity is crucially constituted by relations of looking. Through active looking the subject acquires a sense of subject set off against ob- jects. Through looking at an image of himself in the mirror, the subject gains a sense of narcissistic identiﬁcation with a totalized motor being misrepresented as a unity. In the phallocratic order, however, this sub- ject who takes pleasure in looking at objects other than himself and who takes pleasure in looking at totalized images of himself is a male subject.

Placé sous le signe d’un tel paradoxe, le ilm adopte la forme d’un réseau d’inadéquations entre Lázaro, Luisa et Francisco, aspirants comédiens formant un triangle amoureux.

Only this time in repose, because Agamben’s vision of the end-­of-­history—­the moment humanity transcends its own neuroses and self-­alienation—­resembles a tranquil pagan picnic at dawn, the morning after an interspecies orgy.2 The participants have human bodies and animal heads, since “the total humanization of the animal coincides with a total animalization of man” (2004, 77). The distinction no longer holds. This banquet glows not with erotic tension but with “sexual fulfillment”—­“an element which seems to belong totally to nature but instead everywhere surpasses it” (2004, 83). Such scenes, in which Agamben’s thought shifts from the properly philosophical to an elliptical poetics—­a shift which reliably appears at the end of almost all his monographs—­make it difficult to trace his foot- steps with confidence. The language becomes mimetic of its subject: the mysteries of being, and being-­with. It is also proleptic, in the sense that",

Normality/abnormality, fantasy/reality, sanity/ insanity, beauty/obscenity, agency/dispossession and of course pleasure/ pain – all are thrown into disarray by the corporeal pleasures and desiring drives of the female masochistic subject and her encounters with others and with the sociocultural sphere. In their place arises a move toward processes of signification (and asignification) which are open and always aware of the ethical encounter with alterity in its plural and shifting forms. Bataille states that the things that we ‘know’ become ‘dead objects’ (1988: 4) and that ‘we reach ecstasy by a contestation of knowledge’ (1988: 12). The desires, pleasures and unpleasures with which the female masochist engages are, as this book has offered, frequently as fraught with a…",

What cannot be accounted for through rational or scientiﬁc approaches, like haunting, can yet be named and imaged through the languages of art. The sphere of artistic representation is crucial for understanding how violent spaces are socially constructed and for observing their relation to subjectivity and the imagination (Das et al., 2000; Burgin, 1995). It is precisely in the ﬁeld of the arts that the abstract conceptualization of space, traditionally associated with Euclidian geometry, was ﬁrst questioned (Kern, 1983).

Levinas’s thinking may be contrasted to that found in Elaine Scarry’s influ- ential 1980s book, The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985), which is also relevant for the present study. Levinas’s thinking of the suffering of the other does not entail simply a reversal of the analysis found in The Body in Pain (influenced, as the latter is, more by the analytic tradition rather than the continental). This is in the sense that it does not operate in terms of, and therefore merely subvert, the same conceptual field. Nevertheless, there is a striking contrast between the two. For Scarry, while the pain of the other is always susceptible to doubt, denial or disregard, one’s own pain is undeni- ably certain. For Levinas, on the contrary, while one’s own pain can never",

Time cannot, then, be a sequence but must be marked by an event that will enable us to develop rationally. Our relation to time alters with a certain historical event. Once our reason is redeemed we are capable of determining history for ourselves. The word that Michael uses - 'disciplined' - allows us to think here about Milton's conception of history in relation to modernity.

In one of Lispector's best-known novels, The Passion according to G.H.

It should be clear by now that the notion of co(a)gency serves what we might call an ‘(a)methodological’ purpose. I mean this in the broad sense (see Chapter 1) of allowing us to ‘perform’ the world in a particular way, that is, to narrate everyday life anew. It is a rough and ready tool for excavating usually unnoticed connections that constitute patterns that might suggest unforeseen orderings and disorderings. Co(a)gents are, as I have noted above, reiﬁcations, objectifications. This strategy runs counter to what I called above the ‘will to deconstruction’ that seems to prevail in some academic quarters, and in which there is a concern to focus not upon entities, but upon relations (e.g. Callon and Law, 1995), circulations (Latour, 1999a) or prepositions (Serres and Latour, 1995): the project is to dissolve entities into ﬂows, to demonstrate how the product",

As noted, Longus’ text is a elaborate symbolic structure which relies heavily on the force of mental images, phantasia, conjured by words. To the extent that Lon- gus’ narrator is an indicator of the text’s implied reader, the reader of Daphnis and Chloe is expected to make such Imaginary identifications, which will add power to the significances of the Symbolic order, all items furnished for both education and pleasure.

Even the most “materialist” orientation all too often relies on some big Other supposed to register and legitimize our acts; how then would an activity look which no longer counts on it?

It is one of the tasks of this book to account for the cultural function of this skin fetishism. In so far as we frame this book around the social and cultural production of the skin, we follow the work of Elizabeth Grosz, Rosi Braidotti and Judith Butler. In Grosz’s Volatile Bodies, the challenge to mind/body dualism also challenges the surface/depth model of subjectivity (1994: 218). For Grosz, following from Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari (1992), embodiment involves the intensity of desires and ﬂows which themselves produce the eﬀect of ‘depth’ or interiority. In Rosi Braidotti’s work, also in dialogue with Deleuze and Guattari, the body is under- stood in terms of folding: ‘it is a folding-in of external inﬂuences and a simul- taneous unfolding outwards of aﬀects’ (2000: 159).

The venerable aspect of smooth spaces is that they don't channel desire into arborescent striations and they don't follow axioms like capital. Rather, they present a multitude of vectors as possible lines of flight. Smooth spaces, rhizomes, present moments of becoming; communities can become rhizomatic and smooth, or arborescent and striated. With this in mind, I would like to suggest that open-source computer programming presents an embodiment of the process of rhizomatic becoming, where multitudes can conspire to produce a program which is never total and never complete.

I should stress that they are not the only source for her position and she draws on a wide set of philosophical, social, political, artistic and science-based examples and ideas. It could therefore be claimed that the connection to Deleuze and Guattari can be discarded or needs to be viewed as working alongside others. I accept both these possibilities.

In summary, what limits Merleau-Ponty is the primacy of perception and with it its articulation into perceiving and perceived. The problem is not only that we are used to understanding perception as a specifically human activity, as something humans do. This understanding is overturned if one carefully reads Merleau-Ponty.

We, in short, endorse forms of life that are not in the least bit good for us, coming, as it were, “to misrecognize the bad life as a good one” (174). The hope that effort will eventually pay off, that things will eventually get better, keeps many of us loyal to ways of life that demoralize us; we are so seduced by the mirage of happiness that shimmers on the horizon that we stay patient even when we should not. On the one hand, Berlant is criti- cal of this dynamic, of “the ‘technologies of patience’ that enable a concept of the later to suspend questions about the cruelty of the now” (2011, 28). On the other, she is careful not to pathologize cruel optimism because she recognizes that a degree of hopefulness about the future can be a precondi- tion of surviving the harshness of the present.

It is as legible as it is visible.”78 In discussing the new forms of montage that arrive with the “time-image,” Deleuze writes of a moment of suspension, where the eye “accedes to a function of clairvoyance.” Here “the elements of the image, which are not only visual but also sonorous, enter the internal relations that require the entire image to be ‘read’ no less than seen, to be as legible as it is visible.”79 With this one can argue that the “movement-image” of classical cinema becomes the “time-image” of…",

As Anne Cronin argues, the act of vision stretches both forwards and back. Stretching back, it is simultaneously an act of interpretation which draws, however unconsciously, on other images, the images of memory and the Unconscious.

For Hanold, Gradiva must be one of two things – ‘a hallucination or a mid-day ghost’ (Freud 1990a: 43). But then, in a moment of surprise a lizard darts at the approach of her distinctive tread. She must then be an actual, an existent: ‘So it was no hallucination, but something outside our dreamer’s mind. But could the reality of a rediviva startle a lizard’ (43). Hanold continues to maintain that she has actually come to life in this ‘mid-day hour of ghosts’ (43). Hanold speaks to the ghost and shockingly finds that she is actually a German, like him, of flesh and blood but with all of the qualities of the spectral Gradiva (44). Yet he continues to conflate the physical revenant with Gradiva: ‘A pretty butterfly had…",

Merleau-Ponty takes us beyond that in his considerations of the flesh of the world and of a negativity at the source of perception that is an opening for the sensible and ideas at once. In fact the sensible is sensible in the double sense that it can be sensed and that it makes sense—is meaning- ful—and the body is revealed in its most originary dimension as a dynamic event of an opening articulation of things and the world. One may therefore have included Merleau-Ponty under the heading of this third part of the book that considers the bodily dimension in thought as well as determinations of bodies that are not rooted in subjectivity, also because there are moments where Merleau-Ponty’s thought in The Visible and the Invis- ible is strikingly close to Heidegger’s thought in Contributions to Philosophy. However, at the same time Merleau-Ponty remains tied to the phenomenolog- ical movement through his privileging of perception. Heidegger would probably",

For instance her discussion of the great 1995 strike in France as a generalised attempt to rediscover the self and its dignity reads as kindly, banal and even politically sentimental.

We hear multitudes of sensations congealing into wholes that are neither simply unified nor fragmented. These are structures that Serres, like Bergson before him, calls ‘multiplicities’. In Genesis , he gives many beautiful examples of some kinds of life that have this layered, interwoven and open quality: A flight of screaming birds, a school of herring tearing through the water like a silken sheet, a cloud of chirping crickets, a booming whirlwind of mosquitoes ... Crowds, packs, hordes on the move. 1 If we think of these images of animals and insects and roaming hordes as collections of many things, then we risk reducing their ‘multiplicity’ to meaning simply the numerous, i.e. several instances of what remain distinct entities.

The aim of the analysis is to understand the cognitive achievements of dif- ferent film-makers and types of film. The visual qualities of the film image and the cognitive implications of these qualities are then conceived as autonomous, immanent features of the film. This theory of intrinsic qualities resembles a method of semiotics, but it has an ambiguous relation to conventional semiotic film theory which aims to quantify the narrative units or segments of a film.

Of this vast oeuvre by far the majority are works of fiction, and so it is somewhat surprising that Cixous should be known, in the English-speaking world at least, as primarily a theoretician and critic. Of her books published to date, thirty-four are works of fiction or drama.2 The Hélène Cixous Reader comprises translated extracts from across the full range of Hélène Cixous’ oeuvre, illustrating her work as a feminist and literary critic, and the concerns, scope and style of her fictional and dramatic writing. The extracts are presented chronologically in order to reveal the development of Cixous’ thought, and each text is prefaced with a short introduction situating the passage in the context of the work from which it is",

And although in Gender Trouble (1990) her emphasis is relatively limited to sexual difference, she goes on to develop the idea in a wider field. As Butler sees it, a whole range of normative binaries that are used to characterise embodiment - male/female, health/ill-health, heterosexual/homosexual, black/white and so on - may be exposed in their instability - but also paradoxically confirmed - by the performativity of abject bodies. The precariousness of all bodies is exposed by paying attention to their 'constitutive ou…",

In Arendt’s view, the break in tradition, already begun with the scientiﬁc rev- olution in the seventeenth century, culminated with the political catas- trophes of the twentieth. It is not only pointless but dangerous to try to recover categories of thought that no longer resonate within our current political and historical context, Arendt held. Unfortunately, as she also recognized, just because a tradition has come to an end, traditional con- cepts have not lost their power over us. On the contrary, they can become",

Without re- hearsing in detail the psychoanalytic principles and feminist tenets that inform this interpretation, it is important to note how the structure of the gaze is understood by the proponents of feminist ﬁ lm theory to deﬁ ne and delimit the domain of visual culture as such: the double role of woman as “lack” and as the threat of castration is constitutive of the visual ﬁ eld.

Unlike the spec- tacular terrestrial impacts of climate change, for example, underwater biochemical changes can only be made legible by imaginative forms of scientific and aesthetic mediation, such as those invoked by Richard Doyle as the “ecodelic insight,” the feeling of oneness with the world",

Just as we saw this scenario play out in the case of sexual reproduction, the “ageless,” immortal Nature (Earth) now gets dragged into temporality, exhaustion, and death; it gets pulled into (­human) temporality, which has death as its intrinsic condition, as well as the condition of its own, specific immortality. That is why death remains the only ­thing that man, with all his power and abili- ties, “cannot find an escape from” (Antigone, 359–360).

Indeed, as Claire Colebrook has argued, this Deleuzian concern with apparently spectral or non-material agencies such as, for example, incorporeals or phantasms or pre-individuated larval selves or the aionic dimension of time itself, is a concern primarily with the question of genesis, and specifi cally genesis within, through and from matter rather than anything external to matter (Colebrook 2009: 20).

Artists such as Jasper Johns (she seems to be thinking of his paintings of objects such as flags and tins of paint) create silence by focusing on the thing itself.

For her, women should attain this paradoxical locus in bodily writing. AVA is an example of such bodily writing, not only through its treatment of language but through its use of white space. As Silbergleid suggests, this paradoxical mode of writing relies on Maso’s use of white spaces: “While Maso’s textual silences appear to condone separation—her fragments literally broken by white space on the page—these textual blanks also enable Maso to move toward a language that heals in AVA, a language that brings together and repairs” (18). Thus, the white spaces stand in-between and express the goal Cixous gives to lan- guage. What Maso reveals is that such healing and separateness lie not only in language, as Cixous implies, but also in the material structures of litera- ture that have become unconscious to us.

Noting that Deleuze and Guattari’s work has been relatively absent from discussions regarding postcolonial the- ory, Young argues that their work produces a social theory of desire that ‘cuts through the problematic psychic-social opposition of orthodox psychoanalysis’ (1995, 168). For Young, Deleuze and Guattari’s repre- sentation of capitalism as a desiring machine in Anti-Oedipus not only reflects the development of industrialisation but also the violent process of colonialisation. Deleuze and Guattari’s figuration of the desiring machine and their concept of territorialisation allow Young to map out an ‘ethnography of colonial desire’ which is marked by a ‘dialectic of attraction and repulsion’ (1995, 174–175).

Her analysis is not simply another psychoanalysis of key Western texts, however, because she does not reduce all theological concepts to psychoanalytical ones, but it is nevertheless an investigation and analysis of them on a therapeutic model. She aims to bring to consciousness the deep psychic structures that make up our culture, which she believes are so embedded that simply appealing to rationality will not overcome all the repetition compulsions and deathly urges that structure Western desire. A process of listening and careful unpicking is required to bring us to an understanding and realization of our preoccupation with deathly violence, and to expose the suppressed possibilities of natality and beauty. The latter are not explicitly linked to the feminine by Jantzen, but there is a metonymic association. The therapeutic strategy is a powerful mode of textual analysis, and the call",

      "text": "In this passage, one can hear Butler speaking back to a series of stigma­ tizing narratives about queer and transgendered people. Butler is anx­ ious that her theory of gender melancholia work to disrupt rather than reinforce the habitual association of cross-gender identification, homo­ sexuality, and melancholy. The narratives that Butler resists here sound strikingly like her own theory of gender melancholia. In her theory of blocked identifications there is a surprising and persistent echo of the received understandings of the melancholy of both homosexuality and cross-gender identifica­ tion. Her theory of gender as founded on loss and foreclosed desires chimes in particular with pathologizing descriptions of butch subjec­ tivity. For instance, Halberstam writes regarding the stone butch in Female Masculinity: \"the stone butch has been characterized as more blocked, more lacking, and more rigid than all other sexual identities\"",

There Le Doeuff lays out some of the methodological propositions that guided her enterprise, stressing that what she offers is a retrospective description, a theorization, if you will, of her practice. She attaches to her propositions a “proviso” that they “do not encap- sulate a method systematically deployed” and argues that her practice has, in fact, produced her propositions more than been guided by them.

It is easier to carry a chain of reasoning through on the abstract level than it is to tie it back to the material level, partly because the ‘nature’ of ‘material reality’ is confused; it becomes a mixture, of the generative natural chain, and the subject-object constructions that overlie it. One perspicacious critic of an early draft of this book asked me how I could write about a natural reality as if its character was unproblematic.

Judith Butler argues that what Kristeva discovers as a natural prediscursive maternal subversion is in fact an effect of culture rather than its \"secret cause.\" From that she concludes that by placing the source of subversion outside culture, Kristeva forecloses the possibility of the effective subversion as a cultural practice (Butler 1990, 90–93). As I try to demonstrate, Kristeva quite self­consciously starts her analysis from the effects of disruptions already within the culture and accounts for them not as mere accidents befalling the symbolic but as necessary consequences of the process of signification. 11. See, for instance, Rose (1986, 154): \"It seems to me that the concept of the semiotic, especially in those formulations which identify it with the mother and place it beyond language, is the least useful aspect of Kristeva's work.\" The irony is that of course Rose is ri…",

The corporeal mapping of race and sex is never simple, and feminists need to ask more complex questions about the inter­ relationship of those categories and the body. It is no surprise, then, that the devaluation of women through their putative identification with bodily matters is mirrored by a similarly grounded devalua­ tion of slaves, of children, of animals, and of black people. Work in both philosophy and science studies, as the pieces by Elizabeth Spelman and Lynda Birke show, outlines a move to reduce marginalised others to their bodies. The process of categorisation that works to set in place boundaries between the normal and the abnormal, between the fully human and the sub-human, is as pertinent to the classical institution of slavery as it is to more recent biological reductionism that ties women to their reproductive functions. As Spelman eloquently points out, one heritage of the Platonic distinction between bodies",

Rather than spiraling back toward extinction, then, the death drive would regress from the actual to the virtual; it would constrain the subject to re- visit the very conditions of their survival. In another case, involving a man who lost his wife and his memory in a car accident, Dufourmantelle gives us a sense for how the psychoanalytic clinic of brain damage might unfold: He had forgotten his name, his life.

We will not understand Derrida’s vital contributions to these issues, however, without a full grasp of his thinking of life in particular.

      "text": "this capitalist framework establishes a new cultural reality that Mark Fisher calls capitalist realism. Although Fisher (2009, p.7) differentiates capitalist realism from postmodernism through its comparably ‘deeper, far more pervasive, sense of exhaustion,’ this inescapable reality of capitalism resonates with twenty-­first-­century uses of postmodernism. The chaotic reality produced by post-­Cold War capitalist culture is both inescapable and in perpetual states of crisis, exemplifying a range of postmodernism’s stylistic features – fragmentation, disillusionment, hedonism, hypervio­ lence, and abstraction. The continued critical repurposing of postmodern­ ism, embedded within post-­Cold War capitalism, provides a means of navigating the intensified mechanisms of consumption, excess, and deregu­ lation while acknowledging a ‘stuckness’ within this epochal moment within America…",

Over a few paragraphs, and ignoring art historical practices that tend to keep artists temporally and materially discrete, Deleuze and Guattari’s discussion slips from Lorenzo Lotto to J. M. W. Turner to John Cage. This obscure grouping describes what they call an ‘other’ art: a set of artworks that are formed from relations and experi­ mentation, strange flows, materials and energies. Deleuze and Guattari identify within these particular artworks a ‘force [that] fractured the codes, undid the signifiers, passed under the structures, set the flows in motion, and effected breaks at the limits of desire’ (1983: 369).

Such a relation to otherness, which cannot be based on empathy, becomes the con- dition of possibility for thinking of our different ways of being in the world. The Face This, of course, resonates with Lévinas’ notion of the face of the other in his ethics of alterity. Cooper notes that what Lévinas calls the face of the other is not a visible or tangible object (2006: 15).

This is the point at which encoded words become central. Because the child had not previously been aware of the world as a representational place of persons and objects, she had no connection with naming.

Erikson, in his pioneering work on collective trauma, speaks of “a gathering of the wounded” who have learned a “profoundly unsettling truth: that human institutions cannot be relied on” (Erikson 1994: 232, 239), which astutely describes the isolates of sector B. Those suffering from chronic or pervasive trauma will perceive the world as hostile and beyond their conscious control, influence, or knowledge. This is what Erikson terms the “traumatic world view” (239). However, in the fictional dynamic of plot move- ments, we see a tendency towards inclusion and connectivity, which is recuperative and leads to a coming of terms with trauma, often through social activism. A further expansion of trauma theory, as I have suggested, seems needed, not only to include resilience, but also the influence of forgiveness as a factor in the trauma process. Douglas’…",

For Damasio, consciousness is about the self immersed in the surround through homeostasis; for Prinz, the ‘stream’ of sensory information, seemingly, is without filter. In this way, even self-consciousness is connected to its surround, and porousness becomes a form of relationality.

Even the most ordinary instance of perception re lies on imagination. Moreover, since the invisible essence of any object can never be exhausted in a single perspectival perception, its totality can only be anticipated by means 127",

Merleau-Ponty expresses this paradox of being embedded in a world constituted by our senses and at the same time transcending them: We understand then why we see the things themselves, in their places, where they are, according to their being which is indeed more than their being-perceived—and why at the same time we are separated from them by all the thickness [l’épaisseur] of the look and of the body; it is that this distance is not the contrary of this proximity, it is deeply consonant with it, it is synonymous with it.

In this context Merleau-Ponty almost speaks of different layers (couches)22 but then puts the adequacy of this word into question. Instead he will characterize the originary “natural” experience of perception that is at play in perceptual faith as an archetype that is originarily at play in all different kinds of encounter with the past, the imaginary, and with ideas: “Perception as an encounter with natural things,” he writes, is “the archetype of the originating encounter, instituted and renewed in the encounter with the past, the imaginary, the idea.”23 The archetype of perception is not a basis that is always present and on",

The poet stands his ground. He refuses to ﬂee, even though he feels overwhelmed by the light that comes ﬂooding in from all directions. It is at this point that the last line of the poem resounds like a clarion call: “You must alter your life.” (p. 16) Although Jager (2004) does not mention the sublime, we may see similarities",

Yet, I want to point at some of the problematic assumptions saturating Grosz’s work, stemming very much from the fact that she, like most other new materialist thinkers, operates within the postmodernist tradition that she shares with her social constructionist adversaries. A major problem is Grosz’s emphasis on and gloriﬁ cation of indeterminacy .

Do postmodern discourses attain to such radicalism? One can here isolate three tendencies associated with the names of Emman- uel Levinas (and to a large extent Jacques Derrida), Gilles Deleuze, and Alain Badiou respectively. First of all, a Levinasian perspective tends to bring together the perspec- tive of rights with the perspective of civility. A Kantian formalism regarding the generalized other is supposedly exceeded at the point where a legal ac- knowledgment of freedom passes over into the non-legislatable style of re- garding the other’s speciﬁcity.This is a matterof cultivating a manner, rather than simply following a rule. And apparently this is a liturgical idiom, be- cause respect for the other is described by Levinas in terms of the worshipful acknowledgment of the absolute Other, in his irreducible absence.58",

As with Deleuze and Guattari’s Anti- Oedipus (Deleuze and Guattari 2004), as Foucault (Foucault 2004) notes, Derrida’s texts are also always directed against a certain kind of ‘fascism’; ‘the fascism in us all, in ours heads and in our everyday behaviour…the tracking down of all variations of fascism, from the enormous ones that surround us and crush us to the petty ones that constitute the tyrannical bitterness of our everyday lives’ (Foucault 2004: xiv).

Collings’ radical passivity proposes a startling and empathic form of a justice-to-come that departs from Meillassoux’s resolutely anthropocentric Fourth World of justice. Aaron Ottinger’s essay crosscuts Collings’s argument, although it finds a positivity in Brassier’s ideas about extinction that underlines a different type of disaster, one that is mathematical and material.

This is not a simple revisiting of S/Z nearly half a century on from its appearance; it is, rather, a reopening of realism prompted by the sometimes different propositions found in the preparatory seminar of 1967–9.

This gap between pleasures and bodies helps explain why the attempt to embody pleasure slides so easily into the embodiment of pain. To address the complex Romantic epistemology of pleasure and pain, I here juxtapose Byron’s remarks on pleasure in Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage (1812–18) with those of his physician, John William Polidori, who published An Essay on the Source of Positive Pleasure in 1818.

Bakhtin argues that time and space are inseparable, the intersection of the two creating the integral whole as ‘space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time, plot and history’ (1986: 85).

Yet, it is crucially important to keep sight of textual depictions of disability as representing very real human disability, and not merely as metaphor. As Michael Davidson puts it: “there are cases in which a prosthe- sis is still a prosthesis” (120); that is, in some cases “disability is not a metaphor” for something else but a reﬂection of “a lived reality” (120). In fact, the crit- ical displacement of the disabled or diseased body reﬂects the invisibility of disability in “polite” society.

However, Nancy offers an explicit focus on lines and limits in the context of politics, which, when extended to the ethical sphere, casts a new light on the resources offered by all three thinkers, offering both an extension of, and critical counterpoint to, the more com- mon use of Levinas and Derrida. The engagements with the three key thinkers undertaken then provides a series of different resources for approaching the problem of the relationship between ethics and ‘practical’ politics. The current debate assumes that the concept of ‘ethics’ can, and",

As Jacques Derrida reads it, catachresis is ‘the violent, forced, abusive inscription of a sign, the imposition of a sign upon a meaning which did not yet have its own proper sign in language’ (1982, p. 255). For Davidson, there is no sign in language – ‘text’, it seems, is insufﬁcient – that conveys both the intertextual and interdiscursive quality of all textuality, as well as the material representation of this intertextual- ity in the body of actual texts, thus, ‘for lack of a better term’ (p. 78), he invents the catachrestic neologism ‘palimtext’. Davidson’s catachrestic use of the palimpsest draws attention to ‘the degree to which writing is archaeological, the gradual accretion and sedi- mentation of textual materials, no layer of which can ever be isolated from any other’ (Davidson 1989, p. 79).

Barthes's first major work, Writing Degree Zero (1 953), is a defense of linguistic and stylistic experimentation. A response to Jean-Paul Sartre's VV!zat is Literature? ( 1 94 7), in which Sartre suggests that in order to write politically one should use a plain style and language, Writing Degree Zero details a theoretical framework which combines avant-garde aesthetics with revolutionary politics: experimenta­ tion itself is recognized as political.

If the speaker cannot achieve consummation in the former set of actions, he may nevertheless achieve erotic pleasure in the latter. At the same time, the chiasmus of ``So when I thinke to end that I begonne, / I must begin and neuer bring to end'' creates a self-referential ®gure from which there is no linguistic or logical escape.

A similar but opposite strategy to their respective employment of pleasure and desire may be found in the different ways in which Deleuze and Foucault deal with the notion of the subject. While Foucault continues to discuss the subject, not least in his tracing of the ‘desiring subject’, Deleuze largely tries to abandon the notion in favour of more creative ideas of folding and becoming. If it is indeed a reference to Deleuze and Guattari, as Noys argues, Foucault would say that this attempted abandonment of the subject fails.

When it comes to the animal, many have celebrated the productive effects of Deleuze and Guattari’s take, while some have interpreted it as highly problematic. Donna Haraway, for example, rejects Deleuze and Guattari’s take on animals quite vehe- mently. Haraway’s repudiation of Deleuze and Guattari’s writing on becoming-­animal bears similarities with Jardine’s early response to their concept of becoming-­woman.

It is, for example, now widely held that perception does not simply involve the passive registering of atoms of sensation, or raw sense- data. The least perception involves a bringing to bear of concepts informed by our practical interests, our general cultural stock, and, of course, our personal beliefs and associations. Given, therefore, that our perception is informed by such creative (p.113) complexity, it is perhaps generally apt to say that we perceive ‘styles of being’ rather than objects pure and simple. Now, in our everyday engagement with the world, we are for the most part too involved to notice this creative dimension to perception.

The experiential and material artistic practices of Rist, Piccinini, and Mori all demonstrate a metaphorical capsule aesthetic in the distinctive ways they elaborate upon the mutual entanglements between humans and non- humans and the conditions of postanthropocentric posthumanism (Braidotti) more broadly.

She skilfully and convincingly uses her deep understanding of metapsychology and her mastery of Freud’s seminal papers to demonstrate that thought is one of the manifestations of desire, which, by definition, implies a painful renun- ciation of the object of desire. She explains the trajectory involved in the transformation of a human need into the desire of an object and the devel- opment of the capacity to tolerate pain which is intrinsic to the absence of the object of desire. Using her own words, the author states, “only desire can give rise to the activity of thought, the inalienable pleasure and privi- lege of man”. She develops this idea further by stating that thinking is not only painful but sometimes dangerous, because to think is to exist as a subject, to differentiate oneself from others, with all the risks associated with it.

Further, the analysis of this cou­ pling must acknowledge the way that surrounding objects affect and, in a sense determine, the presentation of the work of art. It is here, just as the human observer becomes ported into a new object that is not completely human, that the second aspect of Merleau-Ponty’s flesh becomes apparent. As stated earlier, one consequence of the revers­ ibility of flesh is that we as humans no longer have an ontologically privi­ leged position from which to observe, manipulate, and engage with other objects.

Whereas the Kleinian understanding of developmental sexual formation may lead us to think that pleasures of polymorphous perversity or bisexuality are given up and these are lost in the trajectory toward normative heterosexuality, Butler emphasizes something different. For her, gendering itself is in effect a function of a demetaphorization, and one that is realized in the performance of heterosexuality as it is founded on a loss that is sustained in a crypt.

These writings were destined to be among Merleau-Ponty’s last, and the more familiar phenomenological language of intention has at this point given way to a novel account of sensibility, one that emphasizes the material passivity and vulnerability of the flesh as much as it does its perceptual powers.

The first is the cinematic Deleuze that emerges from a meeting of philosophy and film in Cinema 1: The Movement-Image and Cinema 2: The Time-Image (hereafter Cinema 1 and Cinema 2, or the Cinema books).2 What is remarkable about this work is that in it we find an eminent philosopher examining cinema seriously as a conceptual practice.

In the later chapters of this book, I try to follow their lead in locating feminist masculinity between hegemonic patriarchal masculinity on one side and feminist rejections of masculinity on the other. But as written, these accounts of feminist mascu­ linity are crucially incomplete; key theoretical and practical questions remain unanswered.

If this is the case, it appears that certain structures are, in some manner, prefigured in consciousness—otherwise, any objects associ- ated with them would be mere sensations disengaged from human meaning (TSB 169).

He considers that “lack refers to a positive condition of desire rather than desire to a negative condition of lack”. When we categorize desire as production, we make it possible to detach the strict equations of subject of desire for the masculine and object of desire for the feminine.

How does phenomenology reinvigorate a truly interrogative mode, in the sense Irigaray intends, as a questioning of the other/object that recognizes its fundamental alterity?

If one believes social emotions must be grounded in certainty or that particular emotions, such as love or empathy, necessarily lead to ethical action, one will often be disappointed. But Das’s discussion of Manto’s story suggests that acknowledgment, compassion, and love, like all acts of inter- pretation, are vulnerable to error, ignorance, and indeterminacy. And yet, she shows they are also fundamentally necessary in embodied and social life. While Das appears to have traveled far from Scarry’s The Body in Pain, her analysis of the limits and possibilities of language about pain ultimately builds in productive ways on Scarry’s critical legacy. Like Scarry, Das acknowledges that pain can reduce the human voice to a wordless cry. Like Scarry, she also sees that pain motiv…",

Such work is modest and weak if taken as critique, strong and strident if taken as celebration, since after all – particularly in the work of Fleury and Beecroft – what is glossily and cannily produced is another set of commodities, and the publicity and sponsorship arrangements through which they are seen and sold. To consume these goods, bearing the tinge of a critique of themselves and their consumption, is the very deﬁnition of ‘camp’, which Susan Sontag argued long ago is the tactic intellectuals employ to sanction their enjoyment of mass culture.

Of course, the same is true vice versa for thinking about death from the viewpoint of anthropology. The (quasi)-transcendental structure that Derrida proposes can account for this aporia and the way each side of the aporia both excludes and is implicated in the other. Derrida refers to this (quasi)- transcendental structure as the ‘Marrano’.

Here the interpretation directed at Deleuze by Laura Mulvey is very fitting: accordingly, Kiarostami reminds us of the “time-image” cinema which emerged from the ruins of the Second World War and initially took shape in Italian neo- realism and the director Roberto Rossellini, whom Kiarostami has expressly said he admires (cf. Laura Mulvey, Death 24x a Second. Stillness and the Moving Image, London: Reaktion Books 2006, p. 130, footnote. 5). In the language of André Bazin, a long take—in which cinematic times and real time are identical— creates time for thinking within the flow of a film. The audience is then called upon to become (more) active (pp. 130, 141). 10 Not even Taste of Cherry (1997) offers this depth, despite the fact that with its plot—an elderly man wishes to take his own life and searches for another man prepared to bury him—and its narrative form—movement and searching in the form of a car journey on which the main character meets three possible candi-",

Butler writes that “the ‘how’ not only organizes the image, but works to organize our perception and thinking as well.”13 For war photos then, what Butler calls the “operation of the frame” is key.

This book is thus concerned with how the plural forms of female subjectivity that have been apparent in recent women’s writing in French impact upon figurations of corporeality. In thinking through ‘the becoming of the body’, it might be helpful to invoke the word ‘transformation’. No longer concerned with the mere reappropria- tion and reinhabiting of historically silenced and excluded voices and bodies, these four writers share a common interest in the radical recon- ceptualisation of the female body. What is particularly striking about their works is that they appear to move beyond the cultural resignifica- tion called for by the second wave, and through the discursive itera- tions of gender signalled by queer theorists such as Judith Butler, to",

It seeks to see the erotic as charged with energy but con- textualized by social norms in relation to bodily erotic practices. By contrast, LaFountain’s reading of Bataille examines alterna- tives to erotic norms and seeks to understand erotic transgression. Here the Freudian model is animated by the Hegelian dialectic. If there might be some possibility of “being whole again”—an idea that the Hegelian totality could be understood not only as the achievement of mind or spirit in its self-actualization but also as some former unity that the erotic calls out for—this condition marks the confrontation with death and excess (the experience of le petit mort). Death and excess present limits to totality. The erotic, orgasmic body confronts death and excess by trying to sim- ulate them.

In due course, then, feminism entered a third- wave, or a deconstructive, phase: one in which women's identity was affirmed at the same time as it was recognised that such an identity was constituted rather than given, and multiple rather than simple (Moi 1985; Braidotti 1991).

In the case of Deleuze and Guattari’s work, the thesis is apparent from the very title of the ﬁrst book they published on the topic. The core of their interpretation is the centrality of the Oedipal triangle to the interpretive practices of canonical psychoanalytic texts, whose effect is, in their view, invariably to reterritori- alize the deterritorializations of the unconscious by making desire depend- ent on an original fantasy, whose basic form involves the threat of castration imposed by a father over a child whose natural object of desire is the mother’s body. By appropriating the concept of the unconscious as the ul- timate substrate of deterritorialization, Deleuze and Guattari argue con- vincingly that the concept of desire as conditioned by the lack imposed by castration not only deprives the concept of the unconscious of its philo-",

One of our interests, then, is in exploring the ways that selected texts demonstrate an awareness of the difﬁculties for women in expressing their desires. Far from being ‘natural’, essential or unproblematically given, the experience of being female is ‘constituted’, as Judith Butler puts it, ‘through discursively constrained performative acts.’5 The per- formance of gender, Butler argues, ‘must be understood not as a singu- lar or deliberative “act”, but, rather, as the reiterative and citational practice by which discourse produces the effects that it names.’6 What has often been seen as an ‘origin and cause’ of identity categories",

One of the strengths of Bennett’s book is her argument that the power that things have to affect is ‘not entirely reducible to the context in which (human) subjects set them’ (5), thus implicating the effects that objects have on each other outside of human observation or thought. However, Bennett still privileges the network or assemblage of objects inter- acting together, as seen in the collection of debris she sees on the street (Harman 2014: 98).

Indeed, Keathley compares the cinephilic moment to Roland Barthes’s punctum developed in Camera Lucida (2000: 26–­7). The cine- philic moment thus involves an abdication of will and is inexplicable in terms of representation, or traditional systems of consideration. In many ways, it compares with LaBelle’s dual operation of unfolding and enfolding that he identifies in the acoustic that I explored in Chapter 3.

Another extremely important “post-” in the development of ecofeminist literary theory and analysis is that of the “posthuman,” which Kerim Can Yazgünoğlu tackles in his chapter. He argues that posthuman thought exposes how anthropocentrism combined with speciesism works to imagine a human world separate from nature rather than fully imbricated in it. Key concepts of posthumanism for ecofeminism to address are “embodied subjects,” “posthuman bodies,” and “ecological genders.” A key aspect of ecofeminism to which posthumanist thought is indebted is that of the dismantling of Cartesian dualisms. Working with Rosi Braidotti’s critique of the “anthropos,” he shows how to develop that sort of posthuman feminism into a richer posthuman ecofeminism.

Perception is a non-passive continual moulding, driven and given by affect. Closely linked to Deleuze and Guattari's concepts of 'multiplicity', 'expe­ rience' and 'rhizomatics', the concept of 'affect' should also be considered in relation to the concepts of 'arborescence' and 'lines of flight'.

The project of rethinking gender as articulated in Butler’s work is thus both deeply rooted in philosophical antecedents and heterodox in its approach to the question of gender. These antecedents are clear in Butler’s use of language, since gender, as she demonstrates, is always a matter of language.

I also consider how pain can shape worlds as bodies, through the ways in which stories of pain circulate in the public domain, with spe- ciﬁc reference to the report on the stolen generation in Australia, Bringing them Home. The second chapter turns to hate, exploring how feelings of injury get converted into hatred for others, who become read as causing ‘our injury’.

From the climate crisis and global pandemic to the chronic multiple crises of capital­ ism and politics revolving around identity-based discrimination, there seems plenty to be pessimistic about. Pessimism has found diverse forms of philosophical and cultural expression, and it is the latter that this book will primarily be concerned with. Pessimism poses a challenge to dominant notions of temporality and progress—aspects that it shares with haunto­ logical thought. In Jacques Derrida and Mark Fisher’s theories of hauntol­ ogy, the present is disrupted by hauntings from the political and cultural past and potential futures. Likewise, pessimism haunts contemporary cul­ ture and fundamentally unsettles linear temporalities. The introduction",

Taken together, Breillat, Didion and Lorde help to teach a range of lessons from what I have defined as an existential philosophical perspective. Approached in the right spirit – and again, speaking from my own experience – they refresh and inspire the disciplinary practice. The selection of sources is admittedly far from perfect.

For, by focusing, however productively, on historical continuities, Agamben is led to downplay the rupture the nineteenth- century “life sciences” represented, and it is precisely the notion of rupture, of a thought or act that would be able to break from its immanent conditions, that is needed to restore power to life. The most insidious difﬁculty confronting us, however, is the fact that we ourselves remain dupes of the dogma that death is imbedded in life; that is, we remain victims of the theme of bodily ﬁnitude, or of bare life, that these sciences cultivate. Alain Badiou, in an interview in Artforum, makes this important point: “The real romantic heritage—which is still with us today—is the theme of ﬁnitude.

She is interested in the variety of ways in which semiosis and chora have been forgotten or repressed in and through a symbolic language that we might say is aligned with the Platonic view of the chora. The symbolic order, as it has taken shape in global culture, is an acculturated language that often simply acts as, sees itself as, a substitution for bodily instincts. The semiotic relationship to the mother, which had a less external relationship to the world—constituted as it was largely by the child’s drives and their private articulations—begins to be lost as the child enters the symbolic. And Kristeva proposes that much of the symbolic language in which we engage has the effect of establishing and maintaining us in a relationship with the not- Mother, who becomes the other, and we inhabit a world too radically external",

Although this book does not insist that the above narratives about the female body in representation are either correct or comprehensive, it uses them as a provisional framework for the analysis of contemporary art, and raises questions about them that are kept in suspension. Both narratives have three themes in common: power, idealism and ambiguity. In the ﬁrst, the themes are positively aligned, since both idealism and ambiguity service the demands of capitalist power. In the second, where the alliance between patriarchal, capitalist power and idealism is under attack by feminists, ambiguity is foregrounded. This ambiguity renders uncertain the status of feminist art production as a counternarrative and it risks pushing the art towards either morbidity or utopian fantasy. Rather than",

Moreover, she denies that sex difference is more fundamental than other differences, construing it merely as a transient artefact of these shifting gender norms. Despite these advantages, Butler’s thought is problematic in that her stress on the cultural production of sex and gender privileges culture over matter and nature. A viable synthesis of her thought with that of Irigaray must therefore considerably revise Butler’s thought too, speciﬁcally (I will argue) by predicating Butler’s claims on the idea that bodies do have a natural character, but one of multiplicity. By this, I mean that each body is naturally composed of multiple forces (pre-conscious impulses to pursue particular kinds of activity), where this character of multiplicity is universally…",

She sees writing as the locus and means of this reformation.23 Ecriture féminine Cixous’ name is most often associated with that of écriture féminine—“feminine writing.” For Cixous such a writing is feminine in two senses.

Susan Sontag, one of the first critics to support the New Fiction, argues against “the project of interpretation” which she considers “stifling” because “the merit of these works lies certainly elsewhere than in their ‘meanings’” (7, 9). She notes that “a great deal of today’s art may be understood as motivated by a flight from interpretation. To avoid interpretation, art may become parody. Or it may become abstract. Or it may become (‘merely’) decorative. Or it may become non-art” (10); art employs “techniques that would fragment, dissociate, alienate, break up” (200). Indeed, the anti-representational, self-reflexive postmodern narrative “systematically sets out to short-circuit traditional interpretive temptations” (Jameson 1987, 219).4 The question of in- terpretation and interpretability leads directly to questions of com- position, of the condition…",

The trial that followed, Guattari insisted, was political. Desire, if allowed to open up to the world rather than be repressed by it, is no longer destructive (as, for example, the desire fuelling fascism) but creative. Importantly, the possibility of expression of ‘social desire’ needs to be opened up beyond resource to representatives. New and direct expressions of desire are crucial if we are to escape the dominant order and ‘build another world’ (Guattari 1996a: 192).

I have chosen the word “toxic” to name such phenomena, but I think that in Braidotti’s work, there are a related pair of operative normative distinctions that do this job in a different way. She distinguishes between “sustaining” or “sustainable”2 forms and those that are understood as “destructive” or even “perverse.” I take it that toxic forms of production would belong to the latter category. The other distinction seems to describe an internal modality of vitalism: some forms of reassembly destroy life, that is, diminish its vitality and restrict its relationality, while other forms increase both its intensity and its relationality.

Meanwhile, fire, flames, tinder, embers, cinders and ashes link the work on mourning (on the crypt and the incalculable remainder) in Glas and Fors to the pyrotechnic erotic encounter between philosophy and psychoanalysis in the Post Card and announce the later writings on translation, poetry and the secret.

Like many of the avant-garde films discussed in this book, and following Deleuze's thought, I move away from discourses about the ways films re- present the world and toward ones in which film images create worlds. In Deleuzian terms, \"time-images\" are direct images of time, comprising the interchange of the actual, what is represented, and the virtual, that which exceeds the image and can only be thought or sensed—both of which the body and mind experience as the sensation of being in time. Deleuze stresses the direct experience of duration as that which \"goes beyond the purely empirical succession of time—past, present and future.\" Rather than being chronological, duration is \"…",

Numerous studies exploring contemporary culture in terms of rhizomatic structures, lines of flight, difference and desire suggest that Deleuze and Guattari’s work provides powerful tools to talk about culture and capitalism as they shape contemporary life.

Sontag’s linking of pastiche with its favoured audience, gay men, is instructive because she shows how a relationship evolved around a social minority making a bid for a cultural form in which they felt they could stake some of their fragmented and sexually deviant identity. The insistence, on the way, on both style and pleasure made the product attractive to those outside as well as inside. The result was the absorption of camp style into the mainstream of popular taste. Sontag’s approach is useful because she is not so much talking about pure or original ‘artistic’ invention, but rather describing how forms can be taken over and reassembled to suit the requirements of the group in question.

In seeking innovative and creative ways to read these dynamics of female corporeality, this book turns to the philosophy of Deleuze, and to his collaborations with Félix Guattari. As we shall see, articulations of corporeality in the work of these writers hold great resonance with a Deleuzian vocabulary, one that invokes flux, mobility, geography, surface and aleatory connection. Navigating such a theoretical frame- work will not be without some critical risk. Deleuze has often been criticised for taking a masculinist approach to philosophical endeavour, for obscuring the body and feminine specificity. Nonetheless, this book will maintain that his philosophy is of increasing relevance to feminist concerns and to thinking about the dynamism of the female body. On",

Concept albums, and devices such as naming each side of an album differently and quoting stanzas from poetry (in Hounds’ case Tennyson’s The Coming of Arthur, 1870), do encourage a more ‘lit crit’ attitude to interpretation, with both reviewers and artists being tempted to make critical connections between inﬂuences, works and weighty matters of epistemological analysis. All such critical baggage can have a considerable impact upon the individual’s critical terrain – how we approach an album, and what we bring with us. More than two decades after the release, it is difﬁcult not to bemoan the impossibility of a ‘pure’ or ‘unconstrained’ reading of Hounds, but the passing of time forces us to either confront the critical context as well as the artistic text, or run the risk of forming an interpretation based on inadequate or insufﬁcient data, if that doesn’t sound too clinical a description.

Undoubtedly, one could under- score similarities between the events described in this book and what we are witnessing today, although we would be inadmissibly ingenuous to assume that the diagnoses of these situations are interchangeable. Nevertheless, in similar assumptions we can encounter the presence of negative influences that can effect the repetition (however differentiated may be the complexes in which they appear) of consequences of immobility, of petrification, of fossilized structures whose preservation works to maintain unjust inequalities.

In her work on Deleuze and nomadics, Rosi Braidotti argues that ‘becoming nomadic means you learn to reinvent yourself and you desire the self as a process of transformation. It’s about the desire for change, for flows and shifts of multiple desires. Deleuze is no Romantic. Deleuze’s nomadology stresses the need for a change of conceptual schemes alto- gether’ (2003, 53, author’s italics).

Categorical desires typically concern one’s ground projects—projects one identiﬁes with. However, I think that the relevant sense of identiﬁcation is not conﬁned to categorical desires: One could have a Proustian moment in anticipation of the diminution of grief for a friend who is not deeply involved in one’s ground projects. This is why I prefer to put the point in terms of the notion of identiﬁcation rather than categorical desires. The notion is well-known from the work of Harry Frankfurt (1971) and the large literature that it has inspired. 10 ",

Indeed, Scarry argues that imagination is the only state that is wholly its objects. There is in imagining no activity, no “state,” no experienceable condition or felt-occurrence separate from the objects: the only evidence that one is “imagining” is that imaginary objects appear in the mind. Thus, while pain is like seeing or desiring but not like seeing x or desiring y, the opposite but equally extraordinary characteristic belongs to imagining. (162) For Scarry, pain and imagination are finally “the ‘framing events’ within whose boundaries all other perceptual, somatic, and emotional events occur; thus, between the two extremes can be mapped the whole terrain of the human psyche” (165). Clarke sees this as well. Representing slavery as an institution that is",

Combining philosophy and feminist cultural studies, Sara Ahmed looks at how the individual’s desire, or social imperative, to be happy, is actually condi- tional to the fulfillment of affective, moral, and ideological conditions, chief of which is the belief that we will be made happy by taking part in that which is deemed good, and that by being happy ourselves, we will make others happy.

Some element of this is perhaps apparent in Gilpin’s description of the experience of using the convex mirror while traveling in a chaise: the rapid succession of pictures “gliding before the eye” are “like the visions of the imagination; or the brilliant landscapes of a dream.”57 This startling sense of strangeness, while linked to the unfamiliar distur- bances of “moving” pictures, is also a function of what de Bolla refers to as an imaginative relation to the phenomenology of viewing landscapes; and in developing an alternative visual aesthetics, it has the effect of constructing “a phantasmic relation to the real” (de Bolla, 119). It is precisely through this ghostly phantom of the real that the invisible may be seen to appear within the more insistent ﬁ eld of the visible, or that the invisible “clings” to the visible, as Novalis has put it.

For one thing, she disagrees about the point in time at which the infant begins to differentiate itself from its mother. She places this break before the mirror stage, at an earlier time, when the infant begins to expel from itself what it ﬁnds unpalatable. This is the process she calls abjection, which I will discuss in detail in the next chapter. For another, Kristeva suggests that the child begins to learn the ways of the symbolic – of culture – from its mother and not just its father. Recall from Chapter 1 Kristeva’s notion of the chora, the psychic space in which the infant resides and in which it expresses its energy. Insofar as the mother is the child’s primary caregiver, the chora is a maternal space. The child orients its energy in relation to its mother – who is not yet an “obj…",

Excitable Speech revisits the contingent ground of performativity through the work of J.L.Austin, and thereby functions somewhat as an archaeology of her previous works. Here Butler is driven to a greater degree of explication of her theoretical debts and methodology in an effort perhaps to halt further misappropriation, which is faintly ironic given the emphasis of her work on the necessity of re-signification.

In Merleau-Ponty’s (1968) work, there is an emphasis on embodiment, not only as ﬂeshy and material but also as ‘wordly’, as being in an intimate and living relationship to the world, which is a world made up of other bodies. Given his focus on the experiential, Merleau- Ponty’s work attends to the multiplicity of sense perceptions: bodies can be touched as well as seen. Following from Merleau-Ponty and Cathryn Vasseleu (1998), Claudia Castañeda’s contribution to this collection attends to the relation- ship between touch and the sociality of embodiment: one is always touched by others, not all of whom are necessarily human. Merleau-Ponty theorises the ﬂeshiness of such intercorporeality through considering the concept of the reversibility of touch: While each monocular vision, each touching with one sole hand has its own",

Although Spector records a move in De Quincey from specular doubling to radical estrangement, he stops short of acknowledging De Quincey’s more dramatic move from specular- ity to spectrality, to the spectralization of the human subject.

In Flags of Our Fathers, the cin- ematic ontology is the idea of ‘motion picture’, of taking a still image and returning it to the dynamic space of movement. During the transition to the narrative level, a picture is given back its story. This constitutes a philoso- phy of film as an art of the gesture. Let us once again take Deleuze as our starting point. He introduces the concept of the “movement-image” in order to express the idea that, in the case of film, no further distinction is possible between image and move- ment, as is possible in the case of painting on the one hand, or of dance and theatre on the other, the two areas being diametrically opposed. While painted images are “immobile in themselves” and need “spirit” which has “to ‘make’ movement”, choreographic and theatrical images conversely “remain attached to a moving body”.1 In the first case, the image is a physi-",

Lingis raises a criticism of Merleau-Ponty’s adherence to a phenomenological standpoint in his account of the libidinal body as flesh. Lingis’s criticism is directed towards the indistinguishability of erotic sensibility and sensuous sensibility in carnal intimacy.16 The intentionality inherent in Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology is present in the account of the libidinal body.

Perhaps the loudest of these is the one that says, ‘But there are only men in Foucault, there are no women’. Not out of duty, but out of respect for the apparatus that has given me voice, I hope to show here some of the creative possibilities that Foucault may hold out to feminist theory. This is also to remember that over the years there have been many ‘women in Foucault’. We can be inspired by their critiques and appropriations of Foucault. It is, of course, hardly news that there is precious little feminism in Foucault, or that the alliance between Foucault and feminism has been a rather fraught one. …",

This is not only because a sublime experience of this sort involves a heightened awareness of past and future presences and moments as ﬂowing out from our present awareness of some overwhelming spatial object, but also because the felt violence of this encounter enhances our awareness of the fact that qua rational beings we can direct and, to some degree, even circumscribe the ﬂow.

Or, to try to put matters as simply as possible, for the time-image, the past can and does change its relationship to the present.

Deleuze’s continual proposal—expanded with Félix Guattari—of an experimental, decidedly non-normative unconscious, certainly makes room for theorizing women’s art and writing,3 and, I believe, it also favors a discussion on female subjectivity in its specificity, and on the feminine.

The chapters jointly shed light on some of the ways in which an agent's beliefs, intentions, desires, and attitudes are constitutive of his or her emotional engagements with art. At the same time, the volume is meant to support and further develop some of the intuitions that initially motivated the influential postmodernist turn to the body and related phenomena.

In repudiating any formal allegiance to traditional religious institutions or their texts, yet in nonetheless locating so much of her writing within the language of these traditions, Cixous seems free to engage in a kind of theo-poetic philosophy that is not in a defensive relation to the orthodoxy of institutions.

Realizing how powerfully and precisely our mental life is displayed through bodily expression, they have shown how the most subtle nuances of belief, desire, and feeling are reﬂected in the postural and gestural attitudes of our ﬁgures and facial countenance. However, in their idolizing love of the human body, artists have usually preferred to portray it as the attractive object of another person’s con- sciousness rather than the radiating expression of the somatic subject’s own probing consciousness of embodied self. Women, particularly young vulnerable women, are the frequent subjects of such objectiﬁcation, por- trayed as lusciously sensuous and obligingly passive ﬂesh for the viewer’s devouring delectation. The artistic yearning to glorify the body’s beauty as desired object often results, moreover, in stylistic exaggerations that",

An important question naturally arises here: do such narcissistic counter- reactions oppose pain and not pleasure? Yes, in one sense; in another sense, no.

First, the repositioning means that, in 1873, a pallid echo of Erotic affirmation and a qualified opening onto futurity are the closest one can come to working through the traumas of slavery.

Following—albeit with some clear criticisms—the lead of Merleau-Ponty, however, she sees the ethical relation, not in terms of separation, but as a mode that occurs between subjects.

He points out that even negative theology itself was often divided and at times even suspected of atheism. Apophati- cism pushes language to the limit and yet it also expresses great desire for the divine. Derrida shows that this desire is always equivocal and carries an autobiographical dimension. Its discourse speaks not only to God but also to the disciple and attempts to turn the other toward God. At the same time negative theology is not a clear genre and often includes reflections on death and mortality (ON, 44). Derrida points to the ambivalence be-",

She goes on to assert that Beauvoir suggests an alter­ native to the gender polarity of masculine disembodiment and feminine enslavement to the body with the notion of body as a situation. On this reading, the body is a material reality that has already been located within a social control; the body is the situation of having to take up and interpret that set of received interpretations (1987: 133). Butler then goes on to take her interpretation of Beau­ voir into territory that has become the central focus of her own work. For Beauvoir, Butler claims, we are culturally constructed but in some sense we also construct ourselves. For Beauvoir, becoming a woman is a project, a set of acts. The problem becomes, then, how gender can be a matter of choice and a cultural construction. To address this problem, Butler turns again to the issue of situation. One",

This account of narrative is useful in a number of ways. It separates desire, the mainspring of all narrative, from the culturally sanctioned public forms through which it is expressed. It explains how women, as readers or spectators, can be `seduced' into complicity with public narratives which position them as sexual object, monster or obstacle: as readers we are caught up in the movement of desire which drives the narrative, even as it works towards a closure which places us ± visually and narratively ± as object of (or obstacle to) that desire.

As Lynch goes on to show, Foucault in holding this position, is grounding sexuality in another crucial phenomenon—power relations: In order to define sexuality as an effect and correlate of power relations, Foucault has to recast our understanding of the basic modes of how power is exercised: power is not top-down, or principally a form of repression but emerges, from micro-interactions, and is profoundly productive, con- stitutive of our very identities. (Lynch 2013: 158) This interpretation of power is central in understanding genealogy in Fou- cault’s philosophy, as Fraser (1989) shows: Foucault’s most valuable accomplishment consists of a rich empirical account of the early stages in the emergence of some dist…",

According to Irigaray, bodily forms exist not only as material facts that are represented to and by subjects in language, but as qualitative sen- sible realities, notably ones experienced tactilely, that profoundly condition the emergence of subjectivity. At the same time Irigaray does not suggest that the tactile experience of lippedness is unmediated by thought. She con- ceives sexuate subjectivity to be nonteleological and nondeterministic: each subject develops amid a specialized organization of factors, among them linguistic and bodily, that come into play and correspond to concrete realities that are distinct for each one and that condition but do not define their evolution. These factors do not create totalities that enclose subjects in a fixed web of possibilities or dictate insurmountable absolutes. Irigaray, in exploring the constitution of subjectivities, decries a lack of comprehen- sion, recognition, and nuance concerning a culture of differing subjects,",

For this reason Churchland, who is often portrayed by his enemies as a grim scientistic liquidator of everything that makes human life worth living, is depicted by Brassier as a humanist sell-out to those merely functional aspects of knowledge that enable the evolution and survival of our species. Nonetheless, Brassier praises both Churchland and Daniel Dennett (b. 1942) for “having driven an irrecusable wedge between our phenomenological self-conception and the material processes through which that conception i…",

As portraits that refuse to romanticize childhood, they might initially seem to conﬁrm what Maudsley called the “unnatural precosity” of the insane child—a sexuality “which is immanent in animal nature” (285). And yet when compared with photographs that were explicitly used to diagnose mental pathology, they seem decidedly dif- ferent. They are quite unlike, for example, Hugh Welch Diamond’s portraits from the early 1850s, depicting “insanity” among the female inmates of the Surrey County Asylum—images which endeavored to capture expressions representative of various diseased states of mind.

In other words, postcolonial- ism explains the Gothic’s instabilities by other means. It is important to note that there are therefore two related issues which this volume addresses. One is concerned with analysing work by writers whom we consider to be writing out of a postcolonial context. In this volume this aspect of postcolonial criticism includes work by Salman Rushdie, Arundhati Roy, J.M. Coetzee and J.G. Farrell. These writers have used the Gothic in their writings in order to examine how images of otherness have been made to correspond to particular notions of terror (in terms of either political uprisings or anxieties about race,",

Mist is further associated with the visits that Aurélie pays to the menhirs and the visions they inspire in her. The impression that Légende gives of a continuum of woman-identified experience connecting two generations of women is accentuated by the spiralling structure of the narrative and by the strategies of repetition that Allard introduces.

Matter feels, converses, suffers, desires, yearns, and remembers.”40 Although she defines the absolute of things as what, in principle, we “cannot know” and stresses that the absolute points to an “epistemological limit,” that is to say, “the limits of intelligibility,” Bennett declares that we need to “shift from the language of epistemology to that of ontology,” i.e., to a language that perceives things",

In his conclusion to The Time-Image, Deleuze himself occupies a curious temporal perspective, both retrospective and prospective. On one hand, Deleuze evinces nostalgia for a certain kind of art cinema, a cinema of Bergsonian duration and Nietzschean recurrence, closely tied to philosophical thought, that has longed struggled for its right to existence, succeeding only intermittently. No doubt Deleuze imagines the fate of his own philosophy as well as the struggle against alienation and capitalism as closely tied to the fate of the cinema. Yet in 1985, with the emergence and increasing power of electronic and digital images in “control societies,” Deleuze also imagined that the struggle for cinema would be a conflict in which the “life or afterlife of cinema depends on its internal struggle with informatics.”9 The five essays comprising the concluding part of this book, “Fu-",

By this practice, to reflect Narcissus is to place him not only at the phallicized center of a male cultural hierarchy where the male image is glorified (and it does do that; Narcissus is a queer man, and I don't apologize for my attraction to phalluses); it is also to place him within a specular optic that submits his phallic oneness to division, multiplication, and a…",

Desperate Housewives represents this subordination while also revealing the performative mimicry involved in the scripted re- enactments of love. If the philosophy of Beauvoir and the TV soap seem opposed genres, I deliberately bring them together to suggest that it is not only high theory that elucidates the love experience but that ‘trash’ culture also reveals much, and sometimes more, about the experience and the structures and mechanisms that enable it.

Moi argues that there is a libertarian individualism running throughout her work which fails to take into account the complex political realities women face.

One of the most intriguing aspects of all this is the entanglement of opposing discourses. As we have seen, Picard repeats some of the failings of which he accuses Barthes: misreading, generalizing from limited evidence, quoting out of context, making dog- matic assertions rather than reasoned arguments.

To begin this section, Sandrine Hansen explores the fact that the phenomenon of habit has been classified as a pharmakon, both remedy and poison. As such, Hansen maintains, habit cannot, as some commentators have suggested, be determined merely as an ontologically adaptive phenomenon, understood univocally as an instantiation of open-ended plasticity.

Derrida’s inquiry into the specter requires closer examination, especially with regard to how his views on ethical alterity and justice differ from those of Levinas. Derrida has long acknowledged his debt to Levinas in his articu- lation of the ethical relation—the precedence of heteronomy to autonomy, justice, and hospitality—devoting several noted pieces and essays to his thoughts, conveying his appreciation in patient, generous, and insightful criti- cisms of Levinas’s work. Yet for Levinas, it is clear that the other (Autrui) of the ethical relationship is primarily the human other (1969, 78–79; 1996a, 8). Derrida’s examination of Levinas’s use of the term “other” not only pinpoints how Levinas is discussing the human other but also notes a disconcerting complicity between the human and divine other in Levinas’s thought.

In short, this book emphasizes a relational aspect of thinking (it is al- ways the case of Nancy and X, and never Nancy alone), if not a certain paratactic thinking.32 It explicates the commonalities Nancy’s thought has with the selected phi­los­o­phers or thinkers ­here; how it is from ­these com- monalities that Nancy’s thought ­will diverge and develop in its very sin- gularity as his own “art” of philosophy delivered in a distinct “singular plural” voice. With regard to such a commonality that only signals differ- ences, perhaps one should leave the last word to Nancy himself: Nancy’s relation with other thinkers or phi­los­o­phers can perhaps be captured by Nancy’s other term of “being-­in-­common.” As Nancy ­will caution us, the sense of commonality in “being-­in-­common” must not be confused with",

Through this adherence, Blanchot ended up repeating the program of a certain kind of literature. However, concurrent with this disquiet, one cannot fail to mention another of Lacoue- Labarthe’s reservations, this time about the fragmentary mechanism of The Writing of the Disaster, which, in its own way, also repeated a literary program—that of romanticism. This reservation is inscribed in what we identified earlier as the first thread of the dialogue that unfolds from The Literary Absolute onward. If The Literary Absolute traced the origin of the modern project of litera- ture to the romantic project of the novel and the fragment, it also, conversely, marked a radical closure of the possibility of these two forms.

The art histor­ ian’s goal is therefore not to uncover an objective meaning, but to explain the work of art through reﬂection on the tenor of its appearance to her or him, and how this appearance positions her or him as a viewing subject.

Muraro’s demonstration of this restorative process passes by way of a rethinking of fixation and hysteria, female neuroses par excellence, a redefinition of the link between logical and factual necessity and between mediation and immediacy, and an extended meditation on the similarities between language and money. The process culminates in a call for a shift in power away from the symbolic disorder of patriarchy, a separation that will make possible a restoration of the symbolic order of the mother, hence a shift that will necessarily be revolutionary in its consequences. That revolution must begin in a reimagining of and struggle over what is sayable, and it can be accomplished only by rigorously following out the implications of restoring sayability to the maternal order, and consequently …",

This metaphoric afﬂiction is followed by a passage in which Rhoda states that she feels “like a mutilated man who looks where his arm was, and cannot believe it gone” (56). Physical suffering, illness, mutilation, and degeneration are used to ar- ticulate Rhoda’s identity crisis, thus linking her damaged psychological state to corporeal torture.

However, in the particular space of the subterranean reservoir, where even if the sewage was not visible it was however present in the imagination, older associations emerged, or perhaps resurfaced - not unconsciously as might be suggested by the psychological model - but with the writers fully alert to the contradictory aspects of this experience and the pull of both fascination and fear. It was the unique character of this space that prompted a conflation of the rational, magical and monstrous - a point emphasised by the writers themselves, who knew this was an experience never to be repeated. Indeed, for the writer for the Daily Telegraph, the new vision paradoxically stimulated these older associations: in short, old and new were inseparably linked. As if to exemplify",

For Deleuze and Guattari, she said, desire was ‘no longer identiﬁed with a purely psychical and signifying relation’ as it had been with Lacan, but was ‘a force or energy which creates links between objects, which makes things, forges alliances, produces connections’ (Grosz 1994: xvi).

While Deleuze is often invoked as a key reference in critical commentary on slow cinema, in such works his con- ceptualisation of the time-image tends to remain fairly briefly outlined and without detailed exploration.180 Addressing this gap, this chapter suggests particular ways of thinking through links between Deleuze, cinema and the slow animal film.

Kevin Kopelson argues – convincingly, I think – that the scorned category of literature may provide the most useful place to explore the expression of prohibited affections: “Literature, for better or for worse, has been a privileged site of cultural expression for so long that many modern subjects are pre- disposed to turn to it for what seems like self-articulation, self-valida- tion, and self-explication. This is especially true for lesbian and gay subjects.”13 As George E. Haggerty notes, ﬁction, including poetry, helps create “dominant ﬁctions” – and subdominant ones, too.14 One only has to look at a few lines of the homoerotic verse of John Addington Symonds or any of the “Uranian” poets, saturat…",

      "text": "Despite their different contexts, there was overlap between the theory and practice of nonauthoritarian movements and feminism. Feminism spoke of shifting the border between the personal and public spheres, of the ten- dency of consumer society to infiltrate every aspect of life, of its deperson- alizing effects, of the voracity of a system that erases the individual as desire and that leads to the “passivity of the masses.” Even though they were often misidentified as “ethically sensitive ques- tions,” matters usually regarded as “nonpolitical,” to which these movements brought attention—the body, sexuality, maternity, health, birth, family rela- tionships, and so on—were repositioned at the heart of politics. After a centuries- old exile, the body now took its revenge: personal life invaded the public scene; it both absorbed and was absorbed by public life. Today, the body is sub…",

They are always already referring to each other, and, since they are inseparably interrelated, they form just one single reality that one could conceive of as “intra-active,” as Karen Barad does it for physical reality (Barad 2003: 83-93). Cinema, writes Pasolini, is the written language of the reality of action, but this reality of action, on its turn, is always already cinema. It is very intriguing that this idea of the world, even before and without cinema, having always already been cinema, comes explicitly, and precisely in these very words, back in film philosophy with Gilles Deleuze’s two volumes on the topic (Deleuze 1985,1989). But Pasolinis approach is relevant far beyond the realm of cinema. Read in the light of Karen Barad’s ideas about “Agential Realism,” we can see the close parallel between Barad’s and Pasolini’s critique of semiology, and of",

Art, Deleuze and Guattari insist, is not a matter of information or its communication, it is instead a “vacuole of non-communication,” the production of a “non-sense” capable of constructing an outside to our everyday affections and perceptions, to our boring opinions and banal thoughts. Expression is the construction of this outside, of a new future, giving art the utopian function of democratizing the processes of production, making aesthetic creation not only an ontological process but also the basis of any liberatory poUtics. This is a strangely modernist position, and raises significant challenges for those of us who wish to use it to understand contemporary art. On the one hand, its figures of rhizomes and nomads, and evocations of constant and creative movement seem to appeal to our contemporary experience. But on the other, Deleuze and Guattari’s equation of art and nature, and their demand for an",

In respect of death, one could say, it names one thing (‘I am the spectator/survivor of someone else’s death, therefore I can tell myself there is no death for me’) and means something else (‘someone else is dead, therefore I know there is death’). In short, representations as symptoms articulate unconscious knowledge and unconscious desires in a displaced, recoded and translated manner. The seminal presupposition underlying this book can be formulated in the following way. Narrative and visual representations of death, drawing their material from a common cultural image repertoire, can be read as symptoms of our culture. Furthermore, because the feminine body is culturally constructed as the superlative site of alterity, culture uses art to dream the deaths of beautiful women. Over representations of the dead feminine body, culture can repress and articul…",
