presented his essay "The Mirror Stage as Formative of the Function of the I as Revealed in Psychoanalytic Experience" [ 1949], in Serifs: A Selection, trans. Alan Sheridan [New York: Norton, 1977], 1-7.) In the whole context of Lacan's theory, the quoted passage seems to be a rare de-emphasis of vision; hence, I am choosing to characterize his theory in my own text as vision-privileging. In his Life and Death in Psychoanalysis, Jean Laplanche clarifies Lacan's de-emphasis of the mirror: "Lacan's intention is certainly not to link in any necessary way the appearance of the human ego to the cre- ation of the instrument of a mirror, nor even, for example, to the fact that like Narcissus, the infant can see his reflection on the surface of a body of water" (Jean Laplanche, Life and Death in Psychoanalysis, trans.

is impossible for art to exist without being perceived. A concept of form in a new meaning had now come into play - not just the outer covering but the whole entity, something concrete and dynamic, substantive in itself, and unqualified by any correlation. This signalized a decisive departure from the principles of Symbolism, which had held that something already "substantive" was supposed to emanate "through form." It also meant that "aestheticism" - a delectation with certain elements of form consciously divorced from "content" - had likewise been overcome. This, however, did not yet constitute an adequate basis for concrete work: To supplement the points established by the recognition of a difference between poetic language and practical language and by the recognition that the specificity of art is expressed in a special usage of material, the principle of the palpableness …

Sophocles, Antigone, 338–41 (Blondell). Antigone repeats this image in 859 (Woodruff) when she mentions ‘‘raw earth plowed three times’’ in conjunc- tion with Kreon’s painful exhuming of her grief. In addition, though he does not use an agricultural metaphor, Janicaud subordinates divinity to humanity by shaping any possibility of transcendence in terms of the superhuman rather than the divine.

affirmed, is unsettled by Ligeia who looks back. Thus, one can surmise that what the narrator glimpses is actual sexual difference or sexual différance beyond binaries - one that disrupts what Irigaray coined hommosexualité.27 Actual sexual difference is veiled as the castrated woman who, in turn, is veiled as phallic; thus, non-binary sexual difference is twice removed. Does this doubly veiled woman ultimately divest her ghastly cerements? But here at the climax of the tale - meant to afford a final anagnorisis - the tale abruptly yet appropriately ceases, since sexual différance can only remain unrepresentable in a signifying system that privileges the signifier of the phallus. Hence, Weininger’s comment on woman’s lack of ontological actuality surprisingly proves equitable when modified and read in the light of the Lacanian ‘la femme n’existe pas’: woman’s non-being results…

Tina Chanter argues, however, that her theory moves beyond any rigid distinction between sex and gender at the same time that it shows that the sexes are not symmetrical. The third cluster of theories are anticipated by each of the essays that follow the primary selections, for the very process of discussing the theory of another already envisions its strengths and suggests alternatives to its weaknesses. Others have thought through these issues, too, and then moved into systematic theories of their own. This volume has a companion.

temological, ontological, and ethical framework that…provides a posthu­ manist performative account of technoscientific and other natural cultural practices” (Barad 2007, 32). Barad’s agential-realism is deeply influenced by the physics/philosophy of Niels Bohr, and is founded on the concept of intra-activity. Unlike interaction, “which assumes that there are separate individual agencies that precede their interaction, the notion of intra-­ action argues that distinct agencies do not precede, but rather emerge through, their intra-action” (Barad 2007, 33). Important for Barad is the idea that there are no individuals outside of intra-action. On an ontologi­ cal level, the basic units of reality are phenomena, which she describes as “neither individual entities nor mental impressions, but entangled material agencies” (Barad 2007, 56). In one move, scientific atomism and Cartesian individualism are denied. It is not possible to “find” atomic particles just

clearly rejects her theory. According to Irigaray, the fear and loathing we associate with abjection do not come from the memory of insufficient dif- ferentiation from the maternal body. Rather, they come from our failure to acknowledge our indebtedness to that body. “How are any other feel- ings possible,” she asks, “when we are asked to move back toward some- thing that has always been negated, denied, sacrificed for the construction of an exclusively male symbolic world?” (Sexes 17). For Irigaray, abjection is thus the effect of psychoanalysis’ dereliction of the mother and not its an- tidote. Terror arises because the abject mother is an unacknowledged sub- stitute for an origin that remains completely unknown and for which we have no language. Invoking Kristeva’s “power of horror” as a lie, a conve- nient burial ground, Irigaray writes: And where are we to find the imaginary and symbolic of life in the womb and

French writer Georges Bataille) to a subject which is offensive and yet which can be treated in terms of its form and style as art. Sontag’s attack on critics who wish to view art as an imitation or commentary on the world culminates in her masterpiece, On Photography (1977). In this collection of essays, originally published in the mid-1970s in The New York Review of Books, she rejects the ideas that photographs are a realistic representation of reality. On the contrary, she regards photography as surrealistic, a term she defines in ‘Happenings’ (included in Against Interpretation) as the ‘idea of destroying conventional meaning, and creating new meanings, or counter-meanings through radical juxtaposition (“the collage principle”).’ Thus photography includes or juxtaposes contrary elements—moving abruptly between different environments, time periods, cultures, classes, objects—and unites them in a ‘realistic’ frame. But this frame, she argues, is simply another aspect of

The nihilistic emptiness of life is in this way a primary concern of man’s: every experience that heightens our sense of continuity with nature, which threatens to overwhelm us with both desire and suffering, unites the self- possession of mankind with a formidable awareness of death. Contrary to the objections detailed below, I will defend the view that we are able to affirm this awareness without succumbing to its pure immediacy. There is a balanced approach to otherness to be found in the writings of Terry Eagleton, Richard Kearney, John Stuhr, and several other contemporary thinkers. This approach embraces the middle way to death, the progressive way, as the one to pursue for ethical reasons; but the…

‘post-anthropocentric’ vitalist philosophies of embodiment, ecology and biotechnology that have the potential to transform theories of sexuality and the sex/gender distinction. The turn to naturalism is prominent across the essays in this collection: so much so that one could venture to say that the future of continental phil- osophy is naturalism, the point at which the gulf with analytic philosophy may ﬁnally be bridged. Naturalism emerges in different forms through this volume: materialism, vitalism, and eco-philosophy among them. Not only Braidotti, but also Bill Martin (‘Continental Marxist Thought’), Caroline Williams (‘Politics and Ethics’), and Douglas Burnham and Melanie Ebdon (‘Philosophy, Literature, and Interpretation’), show that the embodied eco- logical environment is already a key theme for continental philosophy in the early twenty-ﬁrst century.

bound up with its incompatibility with social life, as well. Pain is something we have no choice but to know about ourselves, but that we have no way of communicating to others. Scarry’s third claim is related to the second, for while physical pain is unspeakable in her account, “Psychological suffering . . . does have referential content, is susceptible to verbal objectification, and is so habitually depicted in art that . . . there is virtually no piece of literature that is not about suffering.”14 Hence, physical and emotional pain are wholly dis- tinct experiences with different ontologies, phenomenologies, and attendant ethical obligations. While physical pain belongs to the (antisocial) world of the body, psychological pain belongs to the deeply social world of the mind.15 Finally, Scarry posits that perceiving another’s pain necessarily involves wish- ing it to be relieve…

relevant to Fern’s life and its radical underpinnings. Being a nomad involves living a life on the move, a refusal to be tied down or deﬁned by set deﬁnitions. The nomad desires to discover new things, to grow and set forth on ‘a creative line of ﬂight’. The female protagonist who undergoes this journey can be understood in terms of Deleuze’s nomadic subject in that she is a marginal and marginalised ﬁgure. Rosi Braidotti sees the nomad as embarking on a journey that has the potential to lead to change ‘that destabilizes all identities’. Such destabilisation is central to the journey of the female protagonist of Feminist New Wave Cinema. In other words, the nomadic subject signiﬁes the potential becoming, the opening out—the transformative power of all the exploited, marginalized, 80 The Monstrous-Feminine Forgets Her Manners

its own natural forces in accordance with its own norms. Irigaray starts with the natural, biological existence of the two sexes, and she shows that patriar- chy ensnares the feminine in phallocentric logic. Admittedly, both biological realism and the ontologies that difference feminism created, including Iriga- ray’s, have to face the risk of essentialism. The burden of being born in a female body in a patriarchal culture, the historical oppression of women by men because of their sex, Irigaray thinks, should not lead us to dismiss sex as construction. By accentuating the role of the imaginary body in early texts, I attempt to explain why Irigaray’s ontology of sex is not an essentialist ontol- ogy. Irigaray is stressing that we cannot understand patriarchy if we do not reflect on its symbolic system. The question remains if the disadvantages that the symbolic system creates for women would be annihilated by the new

Golgotha, intentionally lived through a certain anxiety about death. Not myself, because external juxtaposition of meaning on my life or on my death can cloud my judgment and is often used to cover up its striking meaninglessness. Not my contemporaries, because they rightly recall for me what is clearly its meaninglessness, even when for myself, I would pre- fer to deny the evidence. Initially, then, there is nothing left for the Chris- tian, or indeed for all human beings, in the idea of one’s death, except the absolute meaninglessness of one’s own life. This is an inescapable perspec- tive that undermines us from the inside, in the double sense that it both eats away at us and destroys us.1 From the Burden of Death to Flight before Death 1

To elucidate this point, one should note that Apter’s argument draws on Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak’s elaboration of the ‘‘planet’’ as ﬁgure in a critical rewriting of the system-logic of globalization. ‘‘The planet,’’ Spivak argues, ‘‘is in the species of alterity, belonging to another system; and yet we inhabit it, on loan.’’ At the same time, a simple substitutive opposition or reversal of terms will not do. ‘‘It [the planet] is not really amenable to a neat contrast with the globe. I cannot say ‘the planet, on the other hand.’ When I invoke the planet, I think of the effort required to ﬁgure the (im)possibility of this underived intuition.’’38 The planet is a ﬁgure of and name for thinking radical alterity, along with the necessary impossibility of translating ‘‘it’’ along the way: it, the (writing of the) planet; it, the radically other, a ﬁgure of the world we inhabit that ‘‘re- mai…

how the logic of deconstruction and the politics of genealogy can come together in the analysis of sex and sexuality. Although Gender Trouble was published first, its question—whether feminism can have a stable object—is in many ways a consequence of Judith Butler’s later theory, developed in Bodies That Matter, of how sex is produced. In Gender Trouble the question is posed whether feminism can have a stable object; or whether the notion of woman is constructed by the various social discourses surrounding her, and in particular, by feminist discourse. The answer to the question is offered in the nega- tive: feminism does not have a stable object, “woman” is a discourse in relation to other discourses, and it is through discourse that gender is produced. 105

Barthes’s Mythologies were originally magazine articles in Lettres nou- velles, written between 1952 and 1956. They are published with a post­ face, ‘Myth today’, which systematises their intuitive method in terms of Saussurean linguistics. The analysis of myth was for him ‘the begin­ ning of semiology’: it explains how the ruling ideas of a social forma­ tion come to seem universal and natural. It therefore joins the analysis of ideology which is proposed by Marx and Engels in their early text The German Ideology: Each class which puts itself in the place of the one ruling before it, is compelled, merely in order to carry through its aim, to represent its interests as the common interests of all members of society, that is, expressed in an ideal form: it has to give its ideas the form of uni­ versality, and represent them as the only rational, universally valid ones (Marx and Engels, The German Ideology, pp. 64—5).

master-narrative presupposes a uniﬁed subject (the child) desiring a uniﬁed object (the mother). The question is now how this uniﬁcation of desire happens? Lacan’s mirror stage posits that the child sees herself (as in a mirror) as uniﬁed even as the bodily experience of disjointed drives remains diffuse. This experience sets up a split in the developing consciousness of the child between the self as an idealized and never realizable vision and the child’s disjointed bodily and experiential reality. Kristeva theorizes that prior to this uniﬁcation of desires there has to be a proto- separation within the mother-child symbiosis: The abject confronts us ... within our personal archeology, with our earliest attempts to release the hold of the maternal entity even before ex-isting outside of her, thanks to the autonomy of language [before the Oedipal master-story]. It is a violent, c…

Punishment was not the only instrument, according to Nietzsche, as political tyranny and the morality of customs worked in the same direction, to constitute useful subjects. Punishment was a clear- cut instantiation of power, as it relied on pain, approached individuals as an exterior force, which compelled them to do things against their will, and in addition symbolically manifested the futility of their attempts to resist. After 1970, Michel Foucault picked up the same theme of subject formation, while reframing the relationship in terms of productivity (Foucault 1998). The individual was not an independent entity, later subdued by exterior forces, in the process of manifesting their super- iority. Instead, the individual was ‘one of power’s first effects’ (Foucault 2003: 30). That was the deeper meaning of the famous reference in Discipline

21 Nomadic Subjects and the Feminist Archives1 Lisa Baraitser Abstract The publication of the second edition of Rosi Braidotti’s seminal book Nomadic Subjects: Embodiment and Sexual Difference in Contemporary Feminist Theory invites us to think about the notion of feminist archives. In Archive Fever, Jacques Derrida links archive to the death drive, understanding archivation as both conservative and institutive, a “prosthesis” to retentive memory while always being yet-to-come. In the way Braidotti has assembled the second edition of Nomadic Subjects, she proposes a different kind of archive—one that eschews the death drive in favor of a mode of “counter-memory” that is deeply political in its intent. In forgetting to forget injustice, Braidotti’s feminist archive insists on making a difference, while also providing us with the theoretical tools for understanding difference di…

ironically, does not seem to be a question of my act of seeing. Th e illusion of naturalness renders the subjective distortion of the visual ﬁ eld—its reliance on our act of seeing to constitute it—almost impossible to detect. But it is not quite impossible. We see this distortion of desire pri- marily in works of art, like ﬁ lms or paintings, where the constitutive role of our subjectivity can become more prominent. In his Seminar XI Jacques Lacan names the distortion that desire pro- duces in the visual ﬁ eld le regard or the gaze. Th e introduction of this term immediately opens Lacan to a horrible misunderstanding that derailed Anglo-American ﬁ lm theory for decades.  Th e gaze, as Lacan theorizes it, is not the simple act of looking and the mastery involved in that act (as the English-speaking interpreters of Lacan had it), but rather the point at which the distortion…

Many young artists took their cue from Haraway, proving that advances in science and information technologies provide feminists with exciting tools, stim- ulate joyful imaginings and enable new embodied becomings that displace the female nude in art. Linda Dement’s hybrid ‘girlmonsters’, for example, trans- gress boundaries between animal and human or human and machine, and are expressive of a feminist, queer form of desire. On the whole, however, the most challenging cyber art tends to focus on nostalgic ambiguities that cannot be dispelled, such as unease at reality’s eclipse, commercial exploitation of the feminine, or the occasional resurgence of anger that might once have been labelled as essentialist, feminist politics. As I will show in Chapter 8, anxieties are present in Dement’s art, which clearly run counter to the culture of joy and afﬁrmation predicted or aspired to by Haraway. Critics have argued that

to position the human along an embodied continuum of newly vivified things. My approach to posthumanism is thus aligned with Hayles’s cri- tique of transhuman disembodiment, but this erosion of the boundary between vitalism and mortalism marks a departure from Hayles’s call to “celebrate finitude as a condition of human being.”12 Hayles seeks to reclaim the horizon of death from a transhumanist aspiration toward material transcendence, but defining the human through its finitude has significant political, ethical, and psychological implications; as Braidotti notes, philosophical conceptions of the subject’s finitude “fuel an affec- tive political economy of loss and melancholia at the heart of the sub- ject” and support “the constitutive vulnerability of the human subject, which sovereign power can kill.”13 Reconceptualizing death as part of a vitalist continuum rather than as a…

With these somewhat impuissant pronouncements that rely on positivistic notions of representation, Varadharajan alleges that Spivak’s distinction between shuttle and subaltern turns the latter into the insubstantial object of theory. She may be objecting to the presumption that the subaltern is of such epistemological interest that she can be made to shuttle between subject- and object-status, but she registers Spivak’s effort to track how subject- and object-status enact silence as the subaltern’s further curtailment. This stunting of subaltern insubordination—that is, a politically motivated disregard for actual subaltern defiance—allows for self-indulgent musings on theory’s inevitable groundlessness (xxiv). On the basis of this other category of subaltern victimhood, which has not materialized owing to

This book is not a work of cultural or intellectual history, though it is propelled by a fascination with history, with thinking about the nature of time, memory, narrative and the past, as well as the present, the future and the future anterior (‘life will have been so short’). And this fascination, as we will see, is itself evident everywhere in Cixous’s work. We will not neglect questions of context: dates,

Somehow, between frightening medical emergencies and worries, my parents created a space of peace and calm. That living room became, for me, a haven—not from a heartless world, though at times from a world that seemed to consider death separate from life. Sometimes it seemed almost sacred, with the slowed pace, the gentle voices of visitors, music playing, the reading aloud of a letter from a dear friend, someone napping, the seriousness and weight of what we had to face. At other times it was like a newsroom, with the adrenaline of what seemed like the most natural activity: working toward another deadline. The inner peace, and con- frontation with death, seemed inextricably tied to the activ- ity, visits with friends, and th…

Soon, she thought, the rot would set in and her extremities would start to shrivel and fall oﬀ . Th e same realisation appeared to have dawned on the familiar man, who was licking his lips in a way that was less than erotic.

Indeed, most psychoanalytic feminist theories maintain that gender is constructed, and they view themselves (and Freud) as debunking the claims of essential femininity or essential masculinity. Indeed, this seems to be the case when we consider Freud’s claim, for instance, in The Three Essays on the Theory o f Sexuality that heterosexuality is not a given of biological life but a developmental accomplishment,8 his theory of primary bisexuality,9 and his further claim in N ew Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis that to become a woman is a laborious construction which takes the repression of primary bisexuality as its premise.10 At its most general level of narrative development, the object-relations and Lacanian versions of gender development offer (1) a utopian postula- tion of an originally predifferentiated state of the sexes which (2) also

can tend toward a near-endless perpetuation of life in ways that erase the impor- tance of mortality for a posthumanism of the kind that I am articulating via Anti- gone. Such a perpetuation of life grants human living an absolute value, which must be preserved at all costs—including the cost of a disembodiment, related to an effacement of mortality operating here. Giorgio Agamben considers the case of Karen Quinlan, an overcomatose woman, as one among many instances in this vein. See Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, trans. Daniel Heller-Roazen (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998), 164 and 186. Furthermore, humanism’s inevitable reliance on a progress narrative raises provocative questions about the perhaps unbreakable link between humanism and a cyborg posthumanism. 51. Related to this is the positioning of Antigone as brisure, which I suggest in chapter 2. 52. Foucault, The Order of Things, 386–87/398; see also xxiii/15 and 334–35/345–46.

film can develop an abstract image that detaches itself from its own plot and from the reference to the actions and reactions of characters. The second division which defines the border between the first and the second volume, entitled The Time-Image, concerns a much more general trend of aesthetic abstraction, i.e. of a mode of composition which relies more on the stylistic qualities of the film image than on the narrative content that it represents. This possibil- ity of aesthetic abstraction occurs at different moments within European, American and Japanese cinema but in each case it is seen by Deleuze as an affirmation of the visual and aesthetic autonomy of th film image. According to Deleuze, classical or mainstream narrative cinema is organized around an ideal correspondence between camera and character so that what the camera frames and films corresponds in principle to what a character within the fiction would be able to see.

However materiality has had considerable currency in recent debates about the body (Butler 1993, esp. chapter 1) where material characteristics of sexuality have been seen as grounding the arguments of feminism. Butler and others have argued that reference to such material conditions actually imprisons the femi- nist project. In this work we address similar issues with respect to the material world around us (if this is indeed distinct from our embodied selves) but come to different conclusions. Indeed, the authors in this volume contend that material conditions radically shape human actions, but this is not to say that we adopt a simply determinist or ‘functionalist’ stance.

Preface The first of Giorgio Agamben's books to appear in English was Lan­ guage and Death, in 1991, but it was the publication of the English trans­ lation of 7he Coming Community, rwo years later, that accelerated schol­ arly interest in Agamben's writings within the United States. Over the next decade, as more of Agamben's works found their way into the English­ speaking context, ir became increasingly evident rhat Agambcn's influence on the current generation of scholarship would be a lasting one. Given the growing enthusiasm for both Agamben's writing and the questions his writings raise, the time has come for a broader dialogue about his work. The current volume was conceived to be part of this dialogue. Contribu­ tors were selected not merely for the respect they have for Agamben and his work, but for the incisiveness of their interpretation and for their hon­ est engagement with the work's virtues as well as its limitations.

Th e play of light and dark in Blanchot’s language is nothing less than its negotiation of the relation between words and things in their mutual duplicity, which expresses itself in his writing in the paradoxical obscurity of its simple formulations and the clarity of its images, an inversion that gives rise to its combination of abstraction and fl atness, its uncertain and thus enigmatic, fascinating depth. All this is to some degree refl ected in the transition between the fi rst and second version of Th omas l’Obscur, between the novel of 1941 and the much- reduced narrative or récit of 1950 (which was published as Th omas l’Obscur, nouvelle version), as I will now show.

Pascale’s overt reference to ghosts is consolidated by the importance of the voice recorder to Derrida’s understanding of spectrality. In Archive Fever, Derrida exposes the aporia that while we know that someone deceased will never speak again, in any case ‘the phantom continues to speak’ (AF 62), ‘like the answering machine whose voice outlives its moment of recording’ (AF 62). For Derrida, ‘there would be neither history nor tradition nor cul- ture without that possibility’ (AF 62–3), the necessary possibility of a spectral response informed and mediated by technology, such as the device into which Pascale speaks. This is more than sufficient to initiate a heuristic response to the film that would follow the semantic chain of its visual, verbal and aural spectralities. But what if, instead, we follow the knife? To do so is to jump across the subsequent violent encounter with …

By documenting the existence of both a discursive and a temporal gap between two dissimilar styles of deﬁning, and disqualifying, male same-sex sexual ex- pression, Foucault highlights the historical …

perhaps thereby divulges a certain fascination with this body); however, the abject is nonetheless an object of revulsion, always a potential “horror.” The disintegrating body/subject theorized by abjection has less to do with desire for a desublimated realm of being than it has to do with the perception that such a realm is beyond the bounds of human sense, perception, and possibility. Powers of Horror is not about desire to return to the void of the pre-Oedipal womb, but about how subjectivity is established through the very repudiation of the vacuity that it represents. Jay renounces this “ideal” vacuity, yet his own rejection of abject representation itself constructs an ideal: that of the unrep- resentable other, defiant of our comprehensibility even as it is paradoxically conscripted as other. Kristeva recognizes both the necessary initiation of the subject into language and the tyranny of a symbolic order that denies the recalcitrant body of decay, death, and desire.

14 Deleuze and the Schizoanalysis of Visual Art in a transitive fashion: any attempt to define desire as the desire for something immediately puts us back into the realm of lack. Productive desire cannot be the desire for something, it must produce something. This brings us to the most important twist in Deleuze and Guattari’s rethinking of desire: if desire is productive and what it produces is real, then desire must be actual and not virtual. Deleuze and Guattari are quite explicit on this point. Referring to the formation of symptoms, such as hallucinations, Deleuze and Guattari write: ‘The actual factor is desiring-production’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 129). To which they add the following important clarifi­ cation: ‘The term “actual” is not used because it designates what is most recent [which is its usual meaning in both French and German], and because it would be oppos…

126 Erotic light Unlike Merleau-Ponty’s subject/object body that exists in the co-extensivity of an exteriority and interiority folded within itself, the in-stance which Irigaray refers to is an interiority that cannot be thought in terms of the intertwining of subject and object. In contrast to Merleau-Ponty’s use of the idea of touching oneself as the most elementary way in which a subject–predicate distinction begins to be established, Irigaray argues that in touching oneself what or who is subject and what or who is object will never be known because neither of these positions can be distinguished from the other. As Irigaray makes much of in the ‘two lips’, the doubling and positioning of the self in relation to the self in its sensible immediacy is figured as an impossibility within the limits of the self conceived of as a unified phenomenon. In this sense the mobile differentiat…

In what he calls “inverse archaeology,” he argues for locating feelings where they appear, on the surface, in the sensory capacities and electrodermal properties of the skin. Barad and Tomkins, like game studies, also share a problem with “representationalism” and want to locate meaning in the mat- ter at hand, not in signification. I use Barad’s notion of entanglement and Tomkins’s attention to surface in order to argue for a more everyday kind of entanglement, where representation is a form of matter that matters. The same year that Ivan Sutherland first demonstrated Sketchpad, Tomkins and other psychologists met in Princeton to discuss how the af- fects might fit into computer simulations of human intelligence. The aim of the conference, sponsored by the Educational Testing Service, was for psychologists to discuss the potential for computers to expand research into the field…

the technologized bureaucracy of governments in and after states of war, and of the counter-networks of resistance movements (think of the recent coinage of the term “new media revolution” in relation to the political struggles in the Arab region), academics today are still faced with a powerful “tree of academic knowledge,” which produces universities along the hierarchical lines of disciplinary organization. Con- cepts such as “the nomadic subject” (Braidotti 2011c)3 and “the posthuman” (Braid- otti 2013j) enjoy wide recognition, but the field of gender studies—famously catch- ing the wave of institutionalization on a European scale under Braidotti’s inspiring guidance in the 1990s (see Hiltunen, Tagliavini, and Waaldijk in this volume)—still feels new.

(Note that while, like Suchman, I am profoundly sympathetic to Barad’s project, I retain the use of the term “interface” throughout the book even as I detail the interface’s intra- active ﬂuidity.)

and that animates modern cinema in all its forms. It is the thought of the impossibility of thought, a thought that can only be thought but can never be comprehended consciously as such, an unthought that is forever producing a thought, an art, and a cinema that con- tinuously returns us to its mysterious source. Thought, Deleuze tells us­ – ­paraphrasing Nietzsche’s eternal return­ – ­is the ‘repetition of its own birth’ (1989: 165). And what is this birth? What is this genetic event giving rise to thought? It is, Deleuze says ‘a little time in its pure state’ (1989: 169), the pure form of time, the third synthesis of time, the future as it emerges in its unthinkable and so utterly undetermined freedom. There is no longer a necessary link between humanity and the world, quite the opposite because it is precisely the lack of any link that is the driving force of the time-image. The time-image is an image of this

about following the surfaces and textures of everyday life rather than exposing the putative realities of underlying structures.12 The practice of criticism has not always caught up with these important invocations to alternative modes of criticism, but Public Feelings has sought to craft new critical practices through attention to feelings as both subject and method. With its emphasis on identities and public cultures that cultivate non-­normative affects, queer theory has also been a crucial resource for Public Feelings and its version of the affective turn. Especially im- portant have been models for the depathologization of negative feel- ings such as shame, failure, melancholy, and depression, and the re- sulting rethinking of categories such as utopia, hope, and happiness as entwined with and even enhanced by forms of negative feeling.13 The Public Feelings project resists pastoralizing or redemptive accounts of

8 Copula as Oliver points out in the passage quoted above, that philosophy and psychoanalysis are both conventionally understood as one on this point. But it isn’t clear that Kristeva’s description of the maternal as a semiotic space underpinning culture serves to uphold the opposition of mind to body so much as to implicate one in the other. Kristeva offers, for example, a possible discourse of maternity, one that would replace the fantasized comfort of the Virgin Mary with a secular recognition of maternity’s infolding of identity in the other. (This argument is outlined by Ewa Ziarek, among others: cf. Ziarek 1992. Irigaray’s elaboration of the need for a feminine divine explores a similar intuition.) Psychoanalysis, maternity, and poetry are opportunities—if there can be a discourse of maternity, it is possible in the fold of maternity, in the problem of two-in-one of which the pregnant woman is living emblem. As Ziarek outlines it: “Unlike the clear separation of and

While contemporary affect theory and narrative theory are useful tools for reading these novels, rather than simply applying these contemporary theories to the novels I discuss, I use them as catalysts for tracing the already-existing theories, terms and narrative techniques at play in these historical fictions. Sara Ahmed’s concept of the ‘affect alien’, for instance, leads to me the Victorian use of the term ‘morbid’. Lisa Zunshine’s work on Theory of Mind allows me to see how sensation fiction foregrounded the complexity of body reading. My approach may often seem more reading-focused than historicist as I work to trace the terminology and theories present in these novels, but my readings are also…

If we are to concisely reformulate Lacan’s use of the mirror (phase) in its more radical aspect, we could say here that what is in question for Lacan in the image of the mirror is more a matter of specular projection than of mimetic identification. Frow does evoke Freud’s idea of the ego as a “surface” and a “projection of a surface” (51) but isn’t able to make the most of this rather remarkable image, in part due to his lack of distinction between the three Lacanian registers, the symbolic, the imaginary, and the Real. We will return to this metaphor of the mirror shortly, but we can see that it functions at the heart of Frow’s concept of characterization in a complex way, in a sense, in a double way: It is to this dispersal of ego-​identifications that I wish to liken the work­ ings of fictional character. The “recognition” or “identification” of character that forms the basi…

ally, to Deleuze himself. Gert-Jan van der Heiden’s “Contingency and Skepticism in Agamben’s Thought” articulates an encounter between Sextus Empiricus and Giorgio Agamben. Contrary to the usual epistemological reading of ancient skepti- cism, van der Heiden points out the ontological import of skeptical problems. Van der Heiden focuses especially on how skeptical and quasi-skeptical terms (such as ἐποχή and οὐ μᾶλλον, the Platonic εὐπορία, and the Pauline καταργεῖν) underlie Agamben’s ontology of contingency and potentiality. Thus van der Heiden uncovers a peculiar potentiality of the skeptic. The skeptic has the power to withhold assent, to refuse to afﬁ rm or to deny any particular belief; this is the habit of skeptical thinking itself, a power that is not subordinated to any sort of actuality.

we’re forming; we should not make the mistake of thinking that the representation itself is a cause – the representation is a symptom. Do not think about media in terms of what they represent; think about media in terms of what they produce. The final key theme in Deleuze and Guattari’s work is the impor­ tance of desire, which they locate at the heart of all production. Deleuze and Guattari call desire ‘desiring-production’ in order to distance their conception of desire from Freud and bring it closer to Marx’s theory of productive force determinism. Desire creates the world we inhabit: social production is purely and simply desiring-production itself under determinate conditions. We maintain that the social field is immediately invested by desire, that it is the histori­ cally determined product of desire, and that libido has no need of any mediation or sublimation, any psych…

work continually meditates on how it is being produced; it is nearly always deconstructive (without explicitly following Derrida); it is persistently critical at categorical and political levels; it envisages and presents itself as an avant- gardist approach, always seeking to ‘move beyond’, even if this turns out to be difﬁ cult or impossible. In the belief that the best philosophical understanding of humanity can be attained through a study of language, Agamben’s early writings focus directly on language and its limits – where it begins, ends, fails, becomes nothing. Throughout his oeuvre, he has also considered the form and function of aesthetic production, the role of the artist and so on.2 Above these two areas of interest, though, towers his thought on the limits of what it is to be human – investigated in nearly all of his work since the mid 1990s, but culminating (phi…

who rejected their norms. In absolutist France, for instance, criminals were publicly tortured and executed, and the book begins with a detailed and thoroughly gruesome account of the punishment of a regicide in 1757. Foucault immediately juxtaposes this with a list of regulations of an institution for young offenders in the mid-19th century. The rules prescribe the exact distribution of their time: up at six; five minutes to dress in silence; another five to make their beds; work until ten and then a meal, after washing their hands; school at twenty to eleven for two hours; and so on, until bed-time at half-past eight. If the public execution was a spectacle in which the state demonstrated its cruel power to punish those who challenged the sovereign, the institution looks more humane, more lenient, and more constructive. And so, of course, in an obvious sense, it is. But it…

Yet male poetic genius does not exist in isolation. A whole flurry of human and creaturely things – “raging hounds” and their “prey,” in keeping with the Actaeon myth and the hunter’s punishment for seeing a naked ­Diana – follows closely on the poet’s heels once he has touched down in what he calls the “world’s wilderness” (277).

Cixousian readings need not be limited to literary texts, however. Potentially, her approach to thinking can be used to think through any number of issues in any number of different texts.

In individuating us being-toward-death does not exonerate us from the situation of our lives or from those who are in the world with us. Here again, individuation comes to mean both a detachment from the ‘‘empty speech’’ of they and a reorientation to the potential we have to care for ourselves and to care for others. In Heideg- ger’s astonishing words, ‘‘Dying is grounded in care.’’≥∑ The cases I explore in this book represent both a particular practice of being-toward-death, though not necessarily in the fullness of its Hei- deggerian inﬂection, that similarly grounds them in care. The individua- tion that extends from these practices corresponds to subjectivation: it is an individuation that is characterized not by simple isolation, but by grounding in a radically altered being-in-…

Preface xv knowledge in an ‘‘alienated’’ form but also for redeeming the utopian potential of mass culture as a form of nontotalizing knowledge. Chapter 6 extends this line of thought in anotherdirection byexam- ining Gilles Deleuze’s two-volume theory of ﬁlm in the context of the philosophy of history, speciﬁcally that of Michel Foucault. In Cinema 1: The Movement-Image and Cinema 2: The Time-Image, Deleuze ar- gues that a tectonic shift marks the history of audiovisual culture in the twentieth century. The displacement of the movement-image by the time-image involves a turn both in the order of signs, requiring two diﬀerent semiotics, and in the image of thought that characterizes the philosophical orientation of the two regimes. Although Deleuze insists that his two books are not ‘‘histories,’’ in this chapter I argue that the shift from the movement-image to time-image can also be understood as the displacement of a Hegelian philosophyof history-in-images with

that most commentators have rightly pointed out.40 It also joins two dis­ tinct technologies of power operating at different levels; one addresses the disciplining of individual bodies, the other addresses the "global" regulation of the biological processes of human beings.41 It is this "technology of power centered on life" that produces a normalizing society and a new form of racism inscribed within it. Foucault would explore these connections in more detail in his 1976 lectures, but this concern with normality is already prefigured in volume 1 of The History of Sexuality, in Discipline and Punish, earlier still in Madness and Civilization, and The Birth of the Clinic, as well.42 39.

of being decentred and dissolved. As such, it is both self- aﬃrmative and self-destructive, and each in terms of the other. If we have passed symbolically through death yet are still breathing, death has been pressed into the service of eternal life. The sublime thus involves a rhythm of death and resurrec- tion, as we suﬀer a radical loss of identity only to have that selfhood more richly restored to us. These fearful powers blot us out into a kind of nothingness; yet like God this is a fertile rather than barren void, since to suﬀer the loss of all our dis- tinguishing features is to be granted an epiphany of pure self- hood. Feeling crushed and oppressed thus turns at its nadir into its opposite. A vulnerable object becomes an inﬁnite subject. By identifying ourselves with the boundlessness of the sublime, we cease to be anything in particular, but thereby become potentially everything. In this dazzling emptiness, all and

difficulty he provides her with a 'milder sister' who roves through softer, more appropriately pastoral landscapes, but he cannot resist the compelling nature of the 'ardent genius' who 'flies' 'thro' wilder scenes and sterner skies'. True to her gender, Romance cannot be pinned down; she refuses the softer, more genteel life her sister leads; she is not 'romantic' but unruly. Her demeanour suggests not pliability, not love, but mastery. As the poem shows, much of Romance's attraction lies, for Southey at least, in her ability to control, through a kind of stern sexiness, both the elements and her readers, here embodied by Southey's poet persona: as both reader and writer of what he reads he occupies a uniquely supervisory position, both in thrall to and in control of a genre. But Romance herself asserts an authority that compels the poet to versify her history, and in a chronology heavily indebted to Hurd, Warton, Reeve, and the other theorisers of earlier

presupposition of the cultural process of gendering that brings a body into being, by engendering it. Body’s capacity to take a shape through the repeti- tion of the gender norms gives rise to a body that would be intelligible or unintelligible within certain gender regimes. In opposing the mind-body du- alism of the metaphysics of subjectivity, Butler redefines the body as nothing else than an outcome of its encounter with culture. There is no free subject that shapes its body by freely choosing the gender norms that are already available to it in culture, for the corporeal being is always already produced by gender. The question arises if the body is not, therefore, entirely sub- merged in a cultural determinism in which its possibility of being otherwise is foreclosed. Butler finds the possibility of resistance and change by the coming into being of agency and through its performances that play with gender norms.

the cinema books do not present a history of cinema. In Reading the Figural, I suggest that the movement-image and the time-image are not historical concepts and that it is misleading to conceive of the latter as following the former along a chronological time line.8 The two concepts do suggest, however, divergent philosophies of history, owing to their different relationships to the Whole and to their immanent logics of image and sign. The movement-image unfolds according to a Hegelian and dialectical conception of history, while the time-image is Nietzschean and genealogical. The movement-image has a history in a dialectically unfolding teleology. It progresses to a point where it logically completes its semiotic options in what Deleuze calls Hitchcock’s relation-images. This does not prevent it, of course, from persisting and prevailing as a filmic regime, or even from adopting a postmodern form. But the time-image pursues another logic altogether. Expressed as

2 Nancy)s Inoperative Community* Etienne Balibar It is important to recall that 1983, the date when Nancy published his first essay and to which Blanchot reacted imm.ediately,l was the year when a nunlber of truly extraordinary books were published. They put the problem of "community," and, more generally, that of "being-in-common," with the antithetic orientations they include (e.g. the antithesis of communication and community) at the core of their discourse. This is in no way to diminish the original- ity of Nancy's intervention, but rather to explain why it acquired (and keeps acquiring) such an astonishing resonance. Here is a provisional sum.mary. The sam.e year witnessed in France the publication of J ean- Claude Milner's Les Noms indistincts, probably the nlost remarkable effort on the Lacanian side to renew the problem of "identification" and address the issue of "paradoxical ensembles" (rassemblements) as

of the feminine within sexual difference at the level of temporality.2 This articulation of “the feminine within sexual difference” or “feminine sex- ual difference,” while it represents the ongoing, poetic, narrative work and force of the text, nonetheless will never arrive at a stable location or con- geal into an essence. Speculum is, rather, a work of opening, of experimen- tation, of poiesis in the senses both of an ongoing productive activity and of poetic language, and the task of this essay is thus both to limn its shape and to demonstrate something of the extraordinary nature of its philosoph- ical achievement.3 It will perhaps not be quite possible to adequately tease apart the different layers at which this disruption of the masculine dis- courses of philosophy takes place, but we will have to bear the following in mind as we proceed: mimesis, mirroring, optics, image, matter, dramaturgy, narrative, teleology, and temporality.

interpreted as a threat to the concept of postcolonial national commu- nity that attempts to empower the colonised subject. She writes: If the creation of a postcolonial national community is at least in part about the empowerment of the formerly colonised through the systematic preserva- tion of their racial and ethnic speciﬁcities, then such an empowerment could easily be imagined to be threatened by miscegenation, the sexual intermixing among the races. Such sexual intermixing leads to a kind of reproduction that is racially impure, and thus to a hybridisation of the elements of the commu- nity concerned. (Chow 1999: 46) However, Chow argues that Fanon’s anxiety about black women’s sexuality is not in the end that it threatens the racial purity of the post- colonial community but rather that it enacts, or materialises, the theory of hybridity that he espouses and thus positions women …

On the other hand, and as Latour (2007a) has himself keenly noted, recent contributions by Peter Sloterdijk (2004, 2011) helped to pave the way for a more encompassing ‘ecological’ discussion of atmospheres, in terms of how socio-­material conditions of life-­support and survival are held together, or indeed disastrously disrupted, in cities. Sloterdijk’s atmospheres are directly concerned with the limits of the common world, with the material condi- tions required to sustain life in cities, as this invo…

Understanding Media Semiotics﻿ 2 Goals of the present volume The academic study of the media traces its roots to America in the 1930s. It was not until the late 1950s, however, that semiotics ventured into this domain of investigation. That was the decade in which the French semioti­ cian Roland Barthes (1915–80) showed, for the first time, the importance of studying media in terms of how they generate meanings. Semiotic method, as Barthes argued in his 1957 masterpiece Mythologies, is fundamental because, unlike other approaches to media, it focuses almost exclusively on hidden meanings. Incredibly, only a handful of textbooks of “media semiotics” à la Barthes have come forward since the late 1950s. A large part of the reason for this is the fact that semiotics has never really found a niche in the academic landscape and, therefore, that very few “full-time” professional pract…

convinced that his or her clinical attitude would be modified if he or she admitted—as we propose in these pages—that the body is a screen on which memories are projected and that the current somatic suffering of the patient is the vivid resurgence of an earlier pain that had been forgotten. He or she would invite the patient to speak about earlier traumatic shocks, whether psychical or corporeal, that the patient could remember. But we have said that the earlier pain could just as well reappear trans- figured in another affect that is as painful as a feeling of guilt, transformed into a psychosomatic injury or metamorphosed into an impulsive act. How do we explain these avatars of pain? It could happen that the flux of painful energy can strike other neurons than those upon which the image of the aggression is inscribed: other neu- rons, for example, that carry the traces of painful events that were experi-

mid-twentieth century has been condemned for its romantic, pre-structuralist view of art and politically reactionary formalism. Such approaches provide at best suggestive points of departure for ethical criticism, rather than fully devel- oped interpretative frameworks. Moreover, the models of ethics discussed in this chapter either predate poststructuralism, or, in the case of one documentary theorist, reject it as having minimal regard for ethical experience (an allegation which is refuted throughout this book).3 Poststructuralist critics have challenged some of the fundamental beliefs of the Enlightenment philosophers alluded to here: their faith in universal humanity, a transcendental, uniﬁed subject and emancipatory grand narratives of science and reason. Subsequent chapters of this book highlight the problems with a Kantian view of the moral agent as rational, autonomous and univer…

The question of what it means to exist according to listening is one of the questions I use to frame particular instances in which contemporary European filmmakers have appealed to and constructed spectators as listen- ers, a state in which they become ‘all ears’. In turn, the filmmakers I examine in this book –­ Catherine Breillat, Gaspar Noé, Arnaud des Pallières, Tony Gatlif, Lars von Trier and Peter Strickland –­ offer various ways of answer- ing Nancy’s question: what it might mean to ‘exist according to listening’, its possibilities and limits. The ear is the organ we imagine to be open. It is constantly registering sound. Yet the openness of the ear is also a fantasy of perception, one that resonates with the fantasies of perception that have

and basing political as well as personal power in visible beauty—even expanded, “wild and tantalizing” versions—is problematic. In , in “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,” Laura Mulvey called for the ruin of (male) visual pleasure, which fetishizes the ideally—cinematically— beautiful female face and body through the male gaze. It is this male gaze that creates the petriﬁed picture of woman. Theories of the male gaze’s construction of visual pleasure dominated feminist and art theory in the s and were a signiﬁcant aspect of the problematizing of female pleasure, visual and otherwise. More recently some theorists, such as Lorraine Gamman, Margaret Marshment, and Teresa de Lauretis, have been revising gaze theory, opening up avenues of visual pleasure for women.41 Yet when visual pleasure as an essential aspect of women’s beautifying themselves mixes with issues of self-represe…

Chapter 3, then, explores concepts of contemporary cinema based on Deleuze’s categories of the movement-image and the time-image. The first part of the chapter follows the transition from the classical cinema of movement to a modern cinema of time. The emphasis of this analysis will be on the movement-image, its relevance for Hollywood cinema and the specific characteristics that link it to a system of believability and truth- fulness. I will also raise the question if the movement-image really has lost its importance, as Deleuze seems to suggest. In addition, I will look at specific aspects of the time-image that may have influenced mainstream Hollywood cinema. At this point, I also intend to work out the specific

in the words of Zourabichvili, is ‘the very consistence of that which exists’ (Zourabichvili 1994: 109). It is the depersonalisation and dehumanisation of the transcendental ﬁeld that makes the construction of the ethical ﬁeld necessary through an endless experimentation for the sake of the compossibility of abiding dif- ferences, with elements that cannot be expected to resemble the ﬁnished product.

A life ﬁlled as much as possible with active joy, and a life of striving to become worthy of the event may be facilitated or, alternatively, made impossible by the conditions prevailing inside the polis.

(Hattingh & Gaede 2011) describe using ‘symbolic devices’ and searching for ‘visual metaphors’ to convey the story of these events, also for the future. Yet jour­ nalists are also aware that certain photographs echo ‘pre-existing iconic images’, raising the spectre of what Pogliano calls ‘iconic contamination’ that becomes problematic during extraordinary events, when selection requires finding a balance between the news frame and the emotional impact of the image (Pogliano 2015: 37–38). Within this discourse, news images of protests can be seen as both framing devices for the events they portray and as cultural objects with the potential to live on as ‘public pictures’. This points, further, to still and moving camera images as ‘technologies of memory’ through which cultural memory is created and shared, but also questioned and contested (Sturken 1997) and, following Faulkner (…

Insofar as desire is the desire to have the object (a), the desire of fulﬁllment, the masculine and feminine ﬁnd a way to join within the particular conditions of jouissance for each, even though the relation of every subject is ﬁrst and foremost to his or her unconscious Other and not to his or her partner. Lacan deﬁned neurosis as a denial of castration, which means responding to the Other by demand, not by desire. Unfortunately this places the neurotic within a repetition of impossible demands made to an Other who knows nothing of the unconscious denials in play. In perverse fantasy, the sexual difference, while negated in the unconscious, is nonetheless played out through the paradox of fetishistic replace- ments for the lost object(s) fantasy seeks. In consequence, the feminine is often clearly marked by the fetish—by stiletto high heels, bound feet, lacy garters, blue velvet, and so

The originary fractured overlap of so-called subjects—ﬂagged by Heidegger’s concept of Mitsein (with-being) and developed by Jean-Luc Nancy in his discussion of ‘‘being singular plural’’ (that is, being simultane- ously both singular and plural)—subverts the common mode of egocentric, atomistic thinking on the matter of social relations. As Paul Morris puts it: Beginning from the assumption of the existence and reality of the individual, who then, and only then, forges links between herself and other separate and discrete individuals, it becomes all but impossible to conceive of any sort of com- munity at all. One plus one plus one plus one plus one just never seem to add up to more than a number! This separating out of individuals . . . does not let us put Humpty Dumpty together again.

in a similar foreclosure of expressive possibilities to that which can be seen in Mulvey’s female body as male-constructed fetish. The disregard for the body’s expressive and expansive actions in both theoretical scenarios rests upon a split – and the hierarchy of terms resulting therein – that feminist theory has inherited from male systems of thought: the split, and mutual alienation, between mind and body, and, as a consequence, the reduction of the body to a passive surface in need of language and culture to remedy its own lack of intelligence and logic. As I hope to demonstrate as I engage with Butler’s analysis of performativity in Imitation of Life, other basic tenets underpinning Mulvey’s theories also inform Butler’s thought, pre- venting her from considering the active and transformative potential of the body’s expressive capacities. Crucial among these tenets are: the notion o…

Sturken employs the term cultural memory6 rather than collective memory, in order to underline how cultural products not only impact the formation of cultural memory, but how debates around memory form one of the most fundamental elements of the (always conﬂictual) ﬁeld of culture. Another term that should be noted in our discussion is that of “prosthetic memory” proposed by the American historian Alison Lands- berg (2004) to describe the interface among spectators of mass culture (cinema, television) and historical narratives. She argues that the cultural “implant” of memories that are “not ours” not only happens all the time, but also can have ethical beneﬁts (empathy with historical experiences of others). Prosthetic memories turn out to be “real” memories to the extent that subjects act in …

It elucidates how the supreme substance can be active everywhere, without being identical with space or the world, pace the Cambridge Platonists or Spinoza (on one interpretation). Some commen­ tators even suggest the reverse: Kant conceives of substance in analogiam Dei.7 At any rate, his solution is also an attempt to make sense of how immortal, i.e. indivisible, souls can act in the world. Another point about God is briefly mentioned at the beginning of Part II, which deals with further aspects of the theory of physical monads. Thus, Proposition IX claims that ‘Contact is the reciprocal application of the forces of the impenetrability of several elements’ (1:483), which presup­ poses the explanation of impenetrability as the force through which a monad ‘occupies’ its space (Proposition XIII, 1:482). In this context, it is said about God that he is i…

the biological and the cultural world we inhabit. In so doing, Kristeva develops a new conception of ethics. Traditionally, for all the divergence of views within moral philosophy, ethical thought in the West has been nearly unanimous in conceiving of ethical agents as discrete individuals. Drawing on Freud and Lacan, as well as her own experience of pregnancy and motherhood, Kristeva challenges the dominant view that self and other can be clearly demar- cated. She ﬁnds in the experience of pregnancy a relation to an “other” who is never wholly other but at the same time not entirely oneself. The love that a soon-to-be mother feels for this not-quite-other being provides Kristeva with a new model of ethical relationship. This chapter, along with the following one, provides an overview and an assessment of Kristeva’s writing on feminism, maternity, and the ethics she derives from her view…

In Cruel Optimism, for example, Lauren Ber­ lant explores how affective attachments structure common fantasies of up­ ward mobility, job security, po­liti­cal equality, and durable intimacy.

Barthes’ ‘Myth Today’ enables a reading beyond the explicit meaning or narrative level revealing a meta-language or meta-narrative hidden in both the ﬁlmic and the theoretical texts. However, the analysis rests on an assumption that there is something behind the text: a hidden meaning, an overarching broader structure or genre, that provides the key to the further meanings or messages contained within the text. In S/Z Barthes undertakes a self-critique in which he questions the hierarchical structure that this approach entails. CODES In S/Z Barthes implicitly critiques, though he doesn’t entirely reject, his own earlier theory. Barthes had identiﬁed two levels of meaning in signs and utterances. The ﬁrst is the literal meaning (or what Barthes later calls denotation) – in the earlier example this was the black soldier saluting the French ﬂag. The second is the mythic meaning (later called connot- ation) – the myths of equality and colonial allegiance connoted by the

The photographic image courts uncertainty when its sensuous content does not translate into comprehensibility, when it reveals too little, or when the relations into which it is enmeshed are occluded. Even at its crispiest, the photograph falls short of representing the depth of its object, much less the unseen operations that produce the situations and objects depicted. Despite this semiotic poverty, the photographic image can how- ever still be documentary, albeit on its own terms. Paglen’s own approach subscribes to a certain dialectics, in that his images make truth claims that

matter, of course, but only up to a point, I think: they become less relevant as Barthes moves away from what he would go on to call his ‘structuralist phase’ (RB, 103). The propositions in the chapter of the Course in General Linguistics entitled ‘Linguistic Value’ are far more resonant, far more significant, in Barthes’s work. They are also, I want to suggest, the theoretical principles to which Barthes is faithful (‘I am “Saussurian” ’) when he sets his interest in the materials and materiality of writing in an ‘anti-­mythological’ struggle against the endoxal, idealist, expressive model of language. In the vocabulary of The Neutral, I read Barthes’s ‘ink blots’ as marks of a desire for a non-­arrogant theory of language. Arrogance is one of the themes that arises regularly in the course of 1977–8.33 It appears as early as the opening lecture, in fact, just moments after Barthes has affirmed his fidelity to Saussure.

'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema' had great and cumulative effect and I think some significant consequences. One very good example is its impact on Ideology and Consciousness, a journal whose influence on British intellectual thinking in the 1970s went far beyond its seven issues (May 1977-Autumn 1980). The journal's very title betrays an indebtedness to Mulvey's linkages while the first editorial follows Mulvey's style of uncontestable sentences and paragraphs in its account of fetishism and phallocentric power (Adlam et al., 1977). By laying a cloak of materialist psychology over the last puddles of the left, Mulvey established that the subject is always constituted within a set of psychical relations. To explain what precisely these relations might mean in terms of cinema Mulvey turned to Lacan. For Lacan, the difference between the sexes is not simply biological, but takes shape in discourse and signification, for example, in cinema

as ‘abstract sex’. Parisi’s work illustrates a shift in terms of thinking about desire—a move towards thinking about the ways in which advances in contemporary science and in media/information technologies change our conceptions of sex and our relation to it. Finally, I want to suggest that we can understand the proliferation of desire in new media technologies in terms of Deleuzian assemblages to consider machinic productions of desire. In Volatile Bodies (1994), Elizabeth Grosz points out that ‘while psychoanalysis relies on a notion of desire as lack, an absence that strives to be filled through the attainment of an impossible object, desire can instead be seen as what produces, what connects, what makes machinic alliances. Instead of aligning desire with fantasy and opposing it to the real, instead of seeing it as a yearning, desire in an actualization, a series of practices, bringing things together or separating them, making machines, making reality’ (1994a, 165).

This mixture of registers—learned and personal, systematic and sentimental—has given rise to some confusion among those who expected Barthes to provide a discourse more clearly identiﬁ able by its discipline— perhaps musicology, semiology, or sociology. Barthes is still accused today of intellectual impressionism. Either that or his work is divided into periods to suit a particular agenda. Far from looking to unify or transform scattered texts into a co- herent theory, I prefer to follow a few of their melodic and rhyth- mic lines, listening for what piano playing put into play—what it aroused or displaced—in the thought of Roland Barthes. Would not ﬂ itting about theoretical discourses correspond to a kind of musical practice? Would it not correspond to a loving ap- proach that is wary of being ﬁ tted into—bogged down by—some thesis? Barthes loved wavering; he loved the suspension of power and its territorial drive. It was the same with his status as a pro-

are actually a direct result of ‘acts’, performances that are not inherent to us as either male or female but socially determined. Eschewing essentialism in regard to both sex and gender, Butler believes that gender is established and identity constructed through a complicity in gendering acts. The queerness of her text, and especially a focus on the multivalent gender trouble of drag queens, calls this performativity into question, finding spaces in which a complex intersection of sex, gender and sexuality means that the culturally constructed acts begin to fail. Potentially rupturing the subject’s easy participation within the reiterative acts of heteronormative gender, queerness introduces a different form of temporal duration, one that is perhaps focused on a more conscious engagement with the gendered stylization of the body. An awareness of performativity, as Butler outli…

tered thus far, because it marries singularity and determinacy with generic- ity and plurality, yielding neither an undifferentiated and abstract notion of humanity nor a diversity of individuals with nothing in common. The second half of the chapter explores how Serres develops further the con- tinuity between epigenetics and hermeneutics which Malabou begins to elaborate in Avant demain. Humanity is best understood, for Serres, as part of the ‘Great Story’ (Grand Récit) of the universe, a story not only about but also told by the natural world in a way that emphasises the continuity between ‘human’ language and ‘nonhuman’ processes. This insistence upon continuity between the human and the nonhuman also positions Serres very differently to Badiou, Meillassoux and Malabou, who all continue to assume that humanity inhabits a meaningless and indiffer- ent universe, and continue to maintain that to think otherwise is anthro-

her view of the body as potentially transformable is important. All too often, the body in feminist theorising becomes transformable only on the surface. To suggest that the biological body is transformable is very different from saying that it is determining. In that sense, Firestone’s work was not biologistic. Moreover, recent theoretical works tend to ignore the contributions of feminists writing earlier. Elizabeth Grosz’s influential Volatile Bodies (1994), for example, makes no reference at all to earlier feminist work on the body - for example, that of Adrienne Rich (1976). Rich’s work is often interpreted as being biologically determinist, as she asks women to reconsider their relationships to their bodies, to female biology. Women are alienated from our bodies, Rich suggests (in similar vein to Spelman’s ‘somatophobia’): T know no woman ... for whom her body is not a…

excesses of desire. Freud says as much when he situates the ego prior to the sexual drives it cannot manage and beyond these same drives, when the ego imagines the body to be more mature than it is. With Lacan, it is even more explicit insofar as he invents the well- known mirror stage. What is at stake in such a stage is a discordance, a fun- damental gap between a premature body and the anticipatory image of that body that is already mature. There is, therefore, a temporal gap between an incomplete body and its reflected image, one that is overly unified and elab- orate. There is also a gap between a body that experiences the distressing swarming of internal sensations, and its image that, before it, reflects it in a unified and jubilant manner. Sexuality emerges in the discordance between 79 LESSONS ON PAIN

Beauvoir is, of course, a central ﬁgure in the history of feminism. She has read Plato and has a clear knowledge of the traditional interpretation of his texts in modern France, but, as we shall see, antiquity itself serves for her not only as a source of the present but also as a locus of freedom and transcendence. Cixous, as one of the most proliﬁc female authors in modern France, is also one of the three canonical “French feminists.” This terminology is not unproblematic, but the inﬂuence of her concept of écriture féminine is undeniable and her

Hainge ends his book-length study discussing the sonic properties of Phillippe Grandrieux’s cinema by invoking Deleuze’s image of an impossible ear.

The concentration camp is a machine for its production, but because of the fantasmatic nature of the object in question, it is a machine that can never complete its task. Respecting this fact is not only to do justice to the victims, but carries a further recognition of the extremity of the violence: the very impossibility of creating bare life, one could say, is at the heart of the

For Cixous, in Agua viva Lispector insists on the effacement of the subject, which results in opening on a limitless perspective and undoing the frame of common or representable human experience. Lispector practices what Cixous has been looking for. It is the kind of affinity she feels, the kind of shock she receives at a first reading of Agua viva, that prompts her to take a long detour through much of Lispector's work, some of which is more thematically oriented and marked in its style by existentialism. Lispector's contact with the world is immediate: her language portrays the struggle that human beings engage in with their social milieus and with themselves. Yet the writing does not work through…

‘work’ (oeuvre, opera, Werk) results from an act of filiation: an author produces or creates a work which is then a ‘fragment of substance, occupying a part of the space of books (in a library for example)’.5 The author requires authority over the meaning of the work. And the critic seeks to understand the author’s meaning. This hermeneutic concern pervades work-centred studies. And it was also a dominant feature of the Sartrian theory as well. Barthes proposes to place the emphasis on the text, which he describes as a ‘methodological field’. He elaborates: ‘The Text can be approached, experienced, in reaction to the sign. The work closes on a signified’ (p. 158). This means that the text can be read in terms of the sign system which participates in it, while the work focuses on what is meant by it. The plurality of the text permits a full and elaborate network of intertextuality whi…

Feminist ﬁlm theory has long preoccupieditselfwiththeproblemofvisualexcessintheHollywood cinema, and before we consider how these ﬁlms represent the fad- ing female star we need to revisit brieﬂy the debates of the 1970s and 1980s in order to retain a historical awareness of how discussions of women’s presence and absence have emerged to date. Laura Mulvey suggested in 1975 that the hypervisibility of the Hollywood female star repeatedly functions not only as a form of excessive presence but as a marker of absence. The female ﬁgure ‘‘connotes something that the look continually circles around but disavows: her lack of a penis, implying the threat of castration and hence unpleasure. . . . Thus the woman as icon, displayed for the gaze and hence the en- joyment of men, the active controllers of the look, always threatens

the fulfilment of explicit demands can never provide satisfaction. Lacan’s account therefore straddles the divide between depth and surface.

the lost or blocked movement.103 The world takes responsibility for the movement that the subject can no longer or cannot make. This is a virtual movement, but it becomes actual at the price of an expansion of the totality of space and of a stretching of time.104 Deleuze’s model of worlding in cinema as a ‘depersonalizing’ movement recalls the reflections by Deleuze and Guattari on animal worlds as ‘desubjectified’ assemblages and becomings above. The worlding (or ‘worldizing’) envisaged by cinema is similarly an intensive process that extends beyond the subject, and beyond the human. Here in cinema, rather than the action of the senso- ry-motor schemata, there is a ‘virtual movement’, which comes to the fore in the ‘stretching of time’ at work in the realm of the time-image. Thus when Deleuze writes of the ‘movement of the world’ to which the cinema of the time-image bears witness, we understand this ‘world’ as encom-

it is ‘dans l’ordre de la participation, du partage, ou de la contagion’ (AE, 27). The aural sense attunes us to a more primary experience of self-relation, one that has not yet been concretized or objectified by the structures of linguistic perception. Nancy writes: ‘Selon l’écoute, c’est en quelque sorte en lui-même que le sujet se renvoie ou s’envoie’ (AE, 26). The listening subject is sent outwards and returns to itself in an endless series of reverberations: it experiences itself as ‘le rapport en soi’, ‘la résonance d’un renvoi’ (AE, 30). Our subjectivity loops back and forth between the body’s ‘caverne sonore’ to the surfaces and recesses of the material world (AE, 73). The term ‘renvoi’, as Charlotte Mandell notes in the preface to her translation of À l’écoute, means ‘return, send back, repeat, a musical refrain, refer, allude back’.9 The term suggests reflection, rep…

That the “original” darkness (if indeed that phrase makes much sense here) occurred sometime before the birth of the modern world, sometime, that is to say, between the already unspeakable catastrophes of the ancient sixth century, and the dawn of modernity.

initiated by any number of inhuman or posthuman processes, we are in the midst of life, living, and living only because we are connected (or reconnected in new ways) and, so, becoming in a way that expands the field of relationality and intensity. One can see here that Braidotti offers a welcome alternative to Agamben’s notion of bare life, one that in seeking to describe the dispossessed and stateless undercuts the very forms of sustainable connection characteristic of zoe that might counter that condition (we might say that Agamben fails to subject his Aristotle to Spinoza). For Agamben, bare life is effectively arelational, contrasted only with the sovereign power that lays it bare outside the polis. For Braidotti, life is implicitly a matter of interconnection, so it is never quite isolated and shorn of social context in the way that Agamben supposes. Two questions emerge fo…

There is, then, for Agamben, a “constitutive ambiguity [in] the Aristotelian theory of dunamis/energeia” (HS, 47), which has remained unresolved. This issue is largely addressed in Agamben’s analysis of the necessary co-belonging of potentiality and “impotentiality” (adunamia) and of the precise way in which potentiality passes over into act (see potentiality/impotentiality), but Agamben’s argument concerning the primacy of pure potentiality over actuality (and of the human as a “being of pure potentiality” (2007b: 2)) can also be understood by returning to the original Greek word energeia. In the essay, “The Work of Man”, Agamben notes that the term

In this deification of high definition, what has gone largely unnoticed in the various critical engagements with images and the visual world is the place of the seeming adversary of vision that nevertheless constitutes its inextricable counter- part.

Rape-revolt ﬁlms deplore abject masculinity while applauding the woman who, as the monstrous-feminine, revolts against his abject deeds. On her journey through her own personal nightmare, into the depths of abjection where she encounters her violent enemy—brushes up against his abjection—she returns not contaminated but transformed through an intimate or interior revolt that is liberating. In Revolt She Said, Kristeva deﬁnes revolt as both an act of dis- …

suggests that the role of memory has been superseded in our time. However, as Roger Luckhurst (1999: 83) has pointed out, postmo- dernism's emphasis paradoxically overlaps with the work of recent memory theorists. Pierre Nora insists that our current `era of com- memoration' is also characterised by an unprecedented degree of forgetfulness: `We speak so much of memory because there is so little of it left' (1989: 7). Likewise, Andreas Huyssen suggests that `[m]ne- monic fever' is paradoxically attributable to `the virus of amnesia that at times threatens to consume memory itself' (1995: 7). Memory and forgetting do not oppose each other but form part of the same process. In the face of mounting amnesia, there is an urgent need to consciously establish meaningful connections with the past. Postmo- dernist fiction is part of this memory project. Its innovative forms and techniques critique the notion of history as grand narrative, and it

to attrihute to these e1asses an unlimited capacity for defiance and an almost metaphysical power to produce an alternative. The most dangerous aspect of this oscillation between extremes, as Garda Canelini (lY84b) notes, is that there is so much insistence on the juxtaposition of the subaltern and hegemonic culture and on the political necessity of defending the independence of the subaltern culture that the two come to be thought of as two !.juite separate entities. With the presupposition that the task of hegemonic culture is to dominate and that of the subaltern culture is to resist, much research has had no other aim than to inquire about the ways the two distinct roles were carried out. The fact that interpretations of Gramsci have come to this extreme does not imply, in my view, a limitation in the thought of Gramsci, as Garcia Canelini seems to think, I do not consider such positions simply an 'enthusiastic expansion' of the thought of

Do they form another dimension of reality, one defying not only observation and representation but also intervention?. Do they form an immanent plane, an ideally continuous space from which actual beings derive as so many discontinuous segments?. The task of making this ideal plane an object of thought goes beyond mathematics and science. It is a deﬁning task for any future realist philosophy. Manuel DeLanda. Philosophy and Simulation.

still a key provocation to analysis. In fact, crucially for the context of our dis- cussion, the punctum has a potentiality, ‘a power of expansion’, that Barthes indeed defines as ‘metonymic’ (2000: 45). The punctum is the metonymic detail that one ‘stubbornly sees’, which provokes one’s ‘“thinking eye”’ and ‘makes me add something to the photo- graph’ (Barthes 2000: 45). But according to Barthes in Camera Lucida, this phenomenon is unique to still photography; it is not possible in the movies: Do I add to the images in movies? I don’t think so; I don’t have time: in front of the screen, I am not free to shut my eyes; otherwise, opening them again, I would not discover the same image; I am constrained to a continuous vorac- ity; a host of other qualities, but not pensiveness; whence the interest, for me, of the photogram.

In the making of this volume, we asked the authors to liberally but critically explore the economic, psychoanalytic, and sociocultural dynamics that Malabou has also identifi ed as her po liti cal fi eld. All the authors share concerns re- garding the limits and potentials of contemporary neoliberal economics and the reconfi guration of sovereign power that engender techniques of accumulation and dispossession relying upon the fl exibility of labor, the porosity of national borders to fl ows of capital but not working bodies, and juridical apparatuses that riddle the rule of law with exception.4 Th is neoliberal fl exibility is accompanied by forms of violence that reinscribe colonial relations of subjection.

In distinction from the passivity of matter, modern philosophy has variously portrayed humans as rational, self-aware, free, and self-moving agents. Such subjects are not only deemed capable of making sense ofnature by measuring and classifying it from a distance but are also aided in such a quest by theories whose application enables them to manipulate and reconfigure matter on an unprecedented scale.

The Ideal Companion to The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak Routledge Critical Thinkers By Stephen Morton, Tampere University, Finland Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak offers an overtly political challenge to the way we think about literature and culture. As she highlights the many legacies of colonialism, she re-defines the ethical horizons of contemporary critical thought. This volume focuses on her key theoretical concepts, intellectual context and critical reception, providing an accessible introduction to one of the most important thinkers of our time. Stephen Morton introduces Spivak's crucial work through an analysis of such issues as: methodology and Spivak's 'difficult' style deconstructive strategies third world women, the concept of the 'subaltern' and the critique of western feminism re-reading Marx for the global capitalist era

It is these technologies that permit the constant, differential repositioning necessary for perception and action from what Haraway identifies as 'the standpoints of the subjugated.' Indeed, Haraway's essay on cyborg feminism identifies all five of these technologies (if only in passing) as ways to bring about what she hopes will become a new feminist methodology. Of the first 'semiotic' technology, for example, Haraway writes that 'self knowledge requires a semiotic-material technology linking meanings and bodies ... the opening of non-isomorphic subjects, agents, and territories to 257

6 Psychosomatic: Feminism and the Neurological Body (2004) refuses to merely critique neuroscience from a cultural perspective, but instead brings detailed accounts of the neurological body to bear on feminist thought. Our intent in this anthology is to address the dis-ease in contem- porary feminist theory and practice that has resulted from the loss of the material. But our intervention in this debate is a very speciﬁc one. Many within the feminist community have railed against the loss of the material. Many have argued that we must develop theories that bring the material back into feminist theory and practice; however, few have been successful in developing these theories. Our intention in compiling this anthology has been to seek out those few. We have sought theorists who do not simply lament the loss of the material but, rather, attempt to formulate approaches that addr…

27 Passions’ active function: Feminism ries’.13 We should have by now enough of a sensitivity to refuse to participate in a political space where sex dif- ference is reduced to an insignificant factor (or just one among others). Unfortunately, reality seems to fall short of such expectations. Hence we need to persevere along the path of a true critical rewriting of the relationship between passions and politics. It is entirely clear that the questions we would like to put back at the centre of the discussion in these pages are the bequest of the rewriting operated by feminism. In particular, we want to retrieve some of its arguments that are more relevant now than ever. The first argument is that, within the political sphere, there is an analogy between the process by which pas- sions are subordinated and the process by which women are subordinated. As Sara Ahmed reminds us, Emotions are associated with women, who are represented

Anyone who has followed up on Spivak’s founding article,“Can the Sub- altern Speak?” has lost the innocent belief that speaking about and speaking for others is either possible or avoidable.16 Representation, hovering as it does on the edge between these two incommensurable yet inextricable meanings, remains a glib and troubled notion.As a result, the point of fem- inist academic work, and of any political action that is not directly activist, has come under siege.Within the academy, both critical analysis and iden- tity politics have begun to turn against themselves.Meanwhile,speaking with others,an old tradition in anthropology,can only be a false dialogue rife with power inequity.17 Spivak’s indictment of representation’s double bind should,of course,not be taken as a reaso…

Kristeva attempts to reconcile these notions of time in her formulation of a feminism that encompasses both, allowing the maternal body to exist in the linear historical moment, but find expression through a poetic form of language that subverts linearity and allows for the recov- ery of the maternal body. In Kristeva’s schema, poetic language disrupts the dominant linguistic patterns inherent in patriarchal societies, but as Butler points out this relies upon a rather simplistic idea of patriarchy. First, it assumes a homogeneous, unitary, and stable paternal law and, second, if poetic language is taken to exist in relation to this law, its subversive function nonetheless remains secondary to it; it is only ever a transgression against, and within, the dominant mode. Moreover, it is a temporary and unsustainable condition as the subject must inevitably return to ordinary lang…

Because Moi fo- cuses on Butler’s subversion of the sex-gender distinction, and I will support Moi’s conclusion in speciﬁc respects, I will follow Moi in this focus. In Gender Trouble, Butler questioned the motive of feminist theory to seek a theory of gender identity. Feminists believe they need such a general theory of gender, she argued, in order to know what is the sub- ject of feminist politics. Feminism has no meaning as a speciﬁc trans- formative social movement, it is thought, without an account of the “agent” of change, the subject to be liberated; that subject is “woman,” and “gender” is the concept that displays what a woman is. As gen- dered, “women” are distinct from the biological sex, female. Butler ar- gued, however, that the feminist distincti…

Pleasure is produced for a subject-spectator dehned in terms of male psychic processes and psychological needs. Hollywood classical narrative norms are theorized as being sexually imbalanced between an active male protagonist who fuels the narrative and a passive female object who becomes the eroticized spectacle for

It is our thesis that this paradigm is currently emerging and that it is a necessary and exhilarating move for contem- porary feminism. While this volume brings together some of the most thought-provoking and innovative theorists of the new “material femi- nism,” no single volume can hope to represent every point of emer- gence; thus, this volume should be read in dialogue with the work of Luce Irigaray, Rosi Braidotti, Myra J.

kinds of charges against Kristeva. They took issue with her conceptions of the chora, maternity, and the semiotic, arguing that, in invoking these, Kristeva is positing some female essence. Critics linked her idea of the chora with a maternal receptacle, which they linked with her semiotic aspect of signiﬁcation and with woman. They made claims about Kristeva’s supposed “compulsory maternity,” about her quietude in the face of an “implacable symbolic structure.” The concern among many feminists has been that, in Kristeva’s philosophy, woman is linked necessarily with the maternal and that she is powerless to change a male-driven symbolic order. “Ahistorical, biologically reductive, . . . universalist – the list of crimes of which Kristeva is found guilty, under the guise of essen- tialism, abounds,” notes the feminist philosopher, Tina Chanter (Chanter 1993: 182).

the synchronous existence of objects and beliefs from different time periods. In his contribution to this volume, Paul Gilroy offers further thoughts on his inﬂuential concept of postcolonial melancholia. ‘The Closed Circle of Britain’s Postcolonial Melancholia’ traces the construction of the British as a ‘vulnerable, wounded and unjustly treated people’ (p. 188) in the Thatcher years, which in effect divested the victims of racialized hatred of their posi- tion as victims. Gilroy also shows how, not only in Enoch Powell’s rhetoric but also until the present day, the just war against Nazi fascism (and its reactivation in soccer matches) blanks out any engagement with the history of British colonization and decolonization. Gilroy ﬁnds a more progressive stance in the novels of Jonathan Coe, which help to undercut post-imperial melancholia by satire and laughter. He closes his article with a hope for an overcoming of such melancholic denial: ‘Somewhere, against the odds and

Let's call this the Boulez tendency. Now this opposition is probably of no use for deciphering works. There is a minimalism of the very complex: all technological mediations come back to the donation of sound 'now'. And there is an inevitable conceptualism even in the writing of 'poor' works, consisting of noises obtained through the percussion of arbitrarily chosen objects: 'qualunquism' in sound demands the greatest reflection and sometimes a true axiomatic. But above all. the opposition between the two currents is illusory. If it is true that in both cases the aim is to return the ear to listening, it is naive to believe that it is enough to make a sound with anything at any moment to obtain the sound-feeling; and it is dangerous and frivolous to privilege technology, whose end is to test cognitive hypothe-

Men are in control of the action in these stories, and the narrative arc often tames women who at the start of the film are on glamorous display, into a love relation with the hero that brings her into his possession. Moreover, particularly in film noir, men’s anxieties about women and their bodies (such as castration anxiety) are worked through with storylines in which women are investigated and punished or forgiven as guilty objects (Mulvey, 1999 [1975]: 65). Thus the gaze of the viewer is implicitly understood to be aligned with the individual male gaze, one that reflects sadistic drives as the protagonist moves the action forward. Similarly, De Lauretis (1984: 103–57) argues, using Freudian Oedipal theory, that while male protagonists in narratives take action and move through space, the roles of female characters are often limited to

Though it is always dangerous to speak in terms of "choice" within a poststructuralism which deconstructs such notions as agency and free will, Spivak still provides us with a modicum of movement between institutional subject-positions. Her own reading of Mahasweta Devi's "Breast-Giver" moves carefully and deliberately among the "I-slots" of author, reader, teacher, subaltern, and historian. I see two major difficulties in applying Foucault's notion of subject- positions to either a strategy or a theory of reading.8 First, it leads to an inclination to taxonomize, to list one's various categorical positions in linear fashion as if they could be easily extracted and unproblemati- cally distinguished from each other. Second, such a reading can easily lend itself to stereotyping, that is, to labeling "kinds" of readers and

both resonates and enhances Malabou’s thought. Mouroutsou elaborates how, if we read Malabou and Aurelius in conjunction, Malabou’s vocabulary of plasticity, of giving and receiving shape or form, obtains new ethical valences and philosophical possibilities from this Stoical inflection. Aurelius urges us not to passively acknowledge unfortunate events as facts or swallow them as bitter pills, but solicits us to learn to love our fate by creatively shaping whatever comes our way, echoing Malabou’s own pronouncements in What Should We Do with Our Brain? Mouroutsou closes her reflections with the suggestion that we start reappreciating passivity as a power. In an era that “measures” everything in accordance to what one does, makes, and produces, Mouroutsou asks whether we should not decide, instead, to appreciate the power of the mind to receive and be affected as an essential part of what makes an individual and a culture “plastic.” Mouroutsou’s contribution is rich,

In contrast, Blanchot calls journal writing a “trap” (one section is titled “Le piège du journal”) and harshly disparages it for, among other things, clinging to calendar time, and for “turn- ing toward the self” (“comme s’il y avait le moindre intérêt”; “as if there were the least interest”).

reconstitution of critical theory, a reformulation that can unlock the forms of domination inherent in diverse linguistic experiences, reveal the significance of new forms of protest particular to the present conjuncture and imagine the shape of a democratic future that is possible as a transformation of the present situation. Foucault's Discipline and Punish exemplifies the advances and hesita¬ tions of poststructuralism in relation to the mode of information. The book presents a detotalized view of the social field. It examines the formation of new mechanisms of punishment without ontologizing that mode of domination as the key to total freedom or the "riddle of history." Discipline and Punish traces the emergence of a new "technol¬ ogy of power" in the nineteenth century without claiming that it is the base upon which everything else rests, without consigning histories of other aspects of the nineteenth century to the status of epiphenomena

As the waste-matter of the homogeneous world, heterogeneous reality arrives ‘with a force or a shock’ and has a disturbing, even revolutionary potential; examples include human excrement and bodily secretions, vermin, garbage, body parts, words carrying an erotic suggestion, unconscious processes such as dreams and neuroses, criminals, madmen, poets. In ‘The Notion of Expen- diture’ (1933), Bataille insists again on the insufficiency of the principle of classical utility; evoking the bloody sacrifices of the Aztecs and the practice of potlatch among the Tlingit Indians of the American Northwest (as analysed by Marcel Mauss), he asserts the value to society of ‘the principle of loss’, of a non-rational economics of excess

However, it is at this point that things become complicated. It remains entirely unclear how this vision relates to the confrontation with sovereign power that Agamben’s more critical writings appear to call for. As we have suggested above, the source of confusion might be Agamben’s original move of conﬂating sovereignty and biopolitics, which is evident in ‘Tiananmen’, the concluding fragment of The Coming Community that anticipates the thesis of Homo Sacer: ‘Whatever singularity, which wants to appropriate belonging itself, its own being-in-language, and thus rejects all identity and every condition of belonging, is the principal enemy of the State.

tional (or computational) links to the sensory and motor capacities. In short, I wish to reject all talk of the ‘‘intentionality of mental repre- sentations,’’ the idea that mental structures are ‘‘about’’ the world in some direct sense. This goes against the grain of much inﬂuential philosophy of cognitive science (e.g. Searle 1980; Fodor 1987).1 The reader is free to un- derstand such rejection in either of two ways. The weaker stance is meth- odological: even if mental structures are ultimately connected directly to the world by intentionality, there remains the empirical enterprise of char- acterizing them for their own sake. Taking this stance, we are choosing to study mental structures as a kind of ‘‘engineering,’’ temporarily leaving philosophical concerns behind. The stronger stance is to take the rejection of intentionality as prin- cipled—to claim that once the mental structures are properly charac- terized, there will be no need for a supervenient intentionality.

In this instance deﬁnition requires the emergence of an alter- native modality within and to its factual articulation. There is readable therefore a certain vibration, a wavering or shimmering, perhaps itself analogous to the ﬂickering of light in cinematic projection, within and as part of the structure of representation. We have already witnessed this in The Lifted Veil’s levels of reiteration: the more general repetition of a scene, explained away as telepathic power, and, stranger still, the iterability of phrases as a formal acknowledgement beyond Latimer of structural vibration.

I’ve described this process in two case studies elsewhere, and won’t dwell further on it now.22 But the particular form that mathematical posits take now contributes several ways to benign ﬁxation. First, ordinary folk practices with empirical concepts allow those concepts to drift in what we can claim about them, and what they refer to, without our taking ourselves—as a result—to be referring to something new. If we dis- cover that gold is actually blue, we describe that discovery in exactly those words (and not as a discovery that there is no gold).23 By taking mathematical posits as empirically uninstantiated items, we detach mathematical language from this signiﬁcant source of drift. Second, once mathematical posits are taken as real but sensorily unavailable items that provide truths successfully applicable to empirical domains, philo-

59 Chapter Four  Thinking in the Flesh Merleau-Ponty’s The Visible and the Invisible M erleau-Ponty’s thought appears to take a direction that is very much opposed to what the last chapter revealed about Scheler. Where Scheler sees the psychophysical sphere as a stepping stone to higher acts of thought that arise precisely in the sublimating negation or repulsion of the psychophysical sphere of being, Merleau-Ponty wants to tie thinking back to the field of experiences in which it first arises. Where for Scheler acts of ideation reveal the true essences of things, for Merleau-Ponty these acts lose the true nature of things that cannot be found in abstract essences but only in the intimate awareness of our opaque and dense bodily entanglement with them. Despite these differences there are also moments of thought in which Scheler and Merleau-Ponty are very close. Both see the body as a major consti- tutive of and organizing factor in our entanglement with the world, and

physical pain permits political and perceptual complications of the most serious kind. The failure to express pain—whether the failure to objectify its attributes or instead the failure, once those attributes are objectified, to refer them to their original site in the human body—will always work to allow its appropriation and conflation with debased forms of power; conversely, the successful expres­ sion of pain will always work to expose and make impossible that appropriation and conflation. The paths by which these political and perceptual complications arise will be traced descriptively and with little reliance on formal terminology (in part because there is no pre-existing terminology for much of what will become visible here). Very occasionally it becomes necessary to introduce into the argument a some­ what formal term in order to make it clear that a particular phenomeno…

properties. On the other end are statements whose truth is determined almost entirely by the semantic standards alone. In between sits the majority of the statements we make in life, such as those about corpo- rations and works of art, which indirectly correspond to entities and at- tributes that are in many cases mind-dependent. Horgan's view is therefore pluralist in a sense, and the reader is urged to compare it to the somewhat similar views of Wright (chap. 32), Lynch, (chap. 31), and Putnam (chap. 30). But there remains an important dif- ference. Horgan's spectrum of correspondence is strongly hierarchical. Only statements that directly correspond to mind-independent entities accurately report how the world ultimately is. Thus, as Horgan notes, contextual semantics is best seen as a combination of metaphysical real- ism and a new version of the correspondence theory of truth. Introd…

To appreciate the importance of this, it is not necessary to compromise our robust sense of individual life or to denigrate our personal worries about death. It is to say that we are, first and foremost, social animals. One’s own death is always, except in the most lonely of cases, a disruption (one hopes not too mi- nor) of a network of relationships. Even in those lonely cases, one’s death is, in one’s own thinking, a disruption of past or possible relationships or, at the outer reaches of pathos, a lament that one is, quite unnaturally, dying all alone. What Heidegger marks off as the uniqueness of Being-unto-Death seems to me to be a just another version of morbid solipsism. But when I think of my death, I cannot help but think of how others will see me, how others will think of and remember me. When I imagine myself at my own funera…

A semiotic reading of a film analyzes how its meanings are constructed at a deeper level, through the inter- play of its codes of lighting, editing, scale of shot, camera angles, dialogue, and narrative. The key theoretical influence here is Roland Barthes’s Mythologies (1957), which proposes that all aspects of life, from steak and chips to cinema and fashion, could be understood as sign-systems. Barthes shows how these apparently innocent things are steeped in ideological beliefs; for him, myth is a signifier of ideology. In his analysis of myth, he relies on the distinction between denotation

If radical utopianism in its double articulation intends to raise expecta­ tions, then pessimism—perhaps quite obviously—wants to lower expecta­ tions. Storey challenges the critique of utopian texts which are based on the claim that utopias do not take into consideration the complexities and flaws of human nature. This is something that Cioran also does in his essay. Cioran of course has a deeply pessimistic and misanthropic outlook on humanity which he argues contradicts the aims of most utopias. Without mentioning Cioran, Storey argues that human nature is not something static and unchanging, to begin with: The idea that replacing ‘real people’ is what utopia is really about is not only a simplification of human nature, it is a simplification of the history of uto­

74 C H A P T E R T W O literature as therapy is often a target of Parisian disdain. Men have per­ sistently sought to pin down woman, to say what she is and should be. To be female is to be a saintly and self-sacrificing mother, a seductive Siren, a monstrous Medusa. It is to be frozen into a deathlike state, as a passive reflection of male desire. A revolutionary feminine writing, claims Cixous, must explode identity rather than reflect it, subvert co­ herence and the desire for truth, liberate an inexhaustible flood of writ­ ing. "If woman has always functioned 'within' the discourse of man . . . it is time for her to dislocate this 'within,' to explode it, turn it around, and seize it; to make it hers, containing it, taking it in her own mouth, biting that tongue with her very own teeth to invent for herself a lan­ guage to get inside of."20 Taken together, Colette's story an…

Agamben’s emphasis on messianic interruption runs counter to Calvino’s emphasis on becoming, multiplicity (“word crystals”), and trace-threads. Perhaps Agamben would also characterize these emphases as symptoms of transmissibility itself? So to Benjamin’s “melancholic angel” of history and art we will counterpose any of Calvino’s aesthetic figures who embody “a liminal experience, now visionary and now realistic, now both together—always apparently drawn by the forces of nature,” even though the artist is also “always very much aware of what [they] are doing.”155

The ground of the apparatus shifts from troika to motorcar to labora­ tory to curting bench to auditorium, at which point it loops back to the men at the train station. W1th each transposition, a previously transparent med1um is rendered opaque, recontained. Each time that the medium of vision is itself made into an object, a different component of this ever-expanding media appa­ ratus then becomes the new super-basis of perception. This relentless relativ­ ization destroys cinema's aspirations to medium specificiry as well as its claim to ontological immediacy. The apparatus of cinema cannot be reduced to the mechanism of the camera obscura, since cinematic visualization, as Vercov shows, is conditioned equally by…

visual and acoustic media are perhaps more deeply onto-epistemologically entangled than print because they entangle more pronounced differences of the natural/physical and the cultural: Keller’s paper, to be sure, diffracts lit- erature most intensively where the latter is itself entangled with painting and the (admittedly both physical and linguistic!) question of eye/I-sight. Jol Thoms’s photo essay is a fascinating exploration of the “natural” dif- fractions of photography and other media. The contribution combines images with (linguistic) text, iconic/indexical signs with language. These media are shown to be diffractive, both with each other and with the extra-cultural mat- ter they are confronted with. Still images taken from Thoms’s experimental

More than ever, perhaps, given the way VFX designers are to be numbered among the true auteurs of recent cinema, such effects thereby deliver up, and precisely from affect to interpretation, the legible (the “authored” and readable) as well as the merely visible. And often do so in the fashion of a rearview mirror, as well, on the historical vicissitudes of the apparatus. Perhaps one critic above all, Jean Epstein, offers a fully conceptualized way of looking back on film history from the vantage, the virtualities, of the digital moment—­without himself even catching wind of it from his final writings in the mid-­1940s. In his most recently translated study, The Intelligence of a Machine, whose impact for questions of the apparatus will be detailed in the “Sneak Preview,” all cinema is posited as an ontological

what rhythm produces in the body and how it can accentuate jouis- sance . We see this in his account of contact with the keyboard. In one of his last texts, published in the journal Panorama de la musique , Barthes explained that the ivory keys [ les touches ] play a large role in his pleasure and involvement with the piece being played. The touch is at once “soft and ﬁ rm,” because the keyboard is smooth but not slippery. Rather than revisit the distinctions Sar- tre made concerning the ontology of the slippery and the rough, Barthes limited himself to observing that such contact owes less to a light touch than to “a sensual dialogue between the ivory shelf and the cushion of skin.” To be sure, he went back to his love for language in order to explain that the verb “to play” in Spanish is tocar , “to touch” [ toucher ], which indicates a corporeal activity. Nevertheless, his remarks on the complex sensation produced by

This is indeed the model of myth proposed by Levi-Strauss, in the form of the achronic articulation of the folktale, as well as the model justifying a certain number of particular semantic universes (Georges Bernanos, Stephan Mallarme, Antoine Destutt de Tracy). For the semiotician it is comforting to note that a deductive approach en- counters empirically constructed models that can account for the limited corpora. The Structure of Semiotic Systems If deductive considerations thus encounter inductive descriptions, it is because the elementary structure of signification forms the semantic universes taken as a whole into systems. Indeed, as a semantic axis, each of the contents it defines can include others, which are in turn organized into a structure isomorphic to the next structure up in the hierarchy. Thus, the ele…

either upon forms of psychoanalysis or upon forms of “identity politics,” the subject is often typically characterised and described by her or his desire. For Deleuze, desire is not a matter of exerting a will upon exterior- ity, much less a matter of “choice,” either consumerist or existentialist: desire does not “bring something about.” Rather, desire is that which is produced through the encounter that, in the ﬁ rst place, is constitutive of both subject and object, and constitutive of them as subject and object. What Deleuze is trying to do is to ﬁ nd a way of addressing movement as the fundamental form of ontology, but ontology considered as the conditions of our becoming rather than as being. The result is the production of accidental conditions of consciousness or of desire. We are not here talking of desire as a set of “wants” or “choices” based on lack or need or wish.…

While there have been a number of critiques of OOO and SR that demonstrate how it rarely lives up to its own demands (i.e., Wolfendale 2014), it’s on this point that we’ll turn to Jane Bennett’s vital materialism. While Bennett shares a number of concerns of OOO, a point noted by Harman (2018, 240–43), she emphases physical materiality, relation, and the agency of nonhuman objects, providing a theory of objects and relations more in line with the materiality discussed in this book. At the same time, Bennett’s ontology is totalizing, and if OOO tends to overstate the absolute alterity of objects by deferring to an unknowable essence beyond physical materiality, vital materialism overstates the intertwining of the world as a whole, evacuating the pos…

consists of shifting attention (and worry!) from death itself, as a universal and inescapable event, to the speciﬁ c ‘causes’ of death, which are to be neutralized or resisted. And the third consists of a daily ‘metaphorical rehearsal’ of death in its gruesome truth of the ‘absolute’, ‘ultimate’, ‘irreparable’ and ‘irreversible’ end – so that such an ‘end’, as in the case of ‘retro’ fads and fashions, can come to be viewed as considerably less than absolute; as revocable and reversible, just one more banal event among so many others. I am not suggesting that any of these strategies, or even all of them applied together, are fully effective (they can’t be, they are but subterfuges and palliatives after all), or that they are free from undesirable, and sometimes quite noxious, side-effects.

Lee Edelman is doing interesting negative work on a sub- strand of queer love, in an age which the end of humanity is not just a theological, but also a scientific, possibility (Edelman 2004). Indeed, the most promising work for me, in terms of opening up the lover’s discourse to more generous and generative interpretation, are those which challenge the neo-liberal subjectivity upon which love so often rests. (That is, the idea of a unique ‘I’ in the first place.) Leo Bersani and Kaja Silverman in particular have written several books which affirm the more pagan notion of the generic encounter, or analogical refrain, which helps us begin to think about transcending the restric­ tive and blinkered narcissism-a-deux which too often goes un…

While Barad does attribute agency beyond human consciousness, Bryant’s concept of distributed agency organizes and clarifies how agency emerges through interactions and relations. Specific inputs can only be processed by certain assemblages that are, in turn, constituted by a multitude of rela­ tions and entities. Some of these machines are agential and some of them are not. This is an important point. Bryant is not arguing for any kind of pan­ psychism and does not attribute agency to all machines. Rather, and as previously mentioned, agential machines must be able to both initiate action and act otherwise than it did. The result of this limitation is that there are millions of actions and events that do not directly result from agents. But if we do not want to rely on a crude form of Cartesian efficient causality, whereby objects merely clunk together and spin off in random

we need to dethrone the concept of Man because it gets in the way of thinking with the high degree of accuracy and complexity required by our historical context (Foucault 1970, 343). Philosophers like Genevieve Lloyd, Elisabeth Grosz, Rosi Braidotti, Judith Butler, Cate Mortimer-Sandilands, and more recently Mel Y Chen and Christine Daigle, have since substantiated and ampliﬁed this claim for feminist theory, and posthuman or nonhuman feminist theorizing has since thrived in these veins. Put somewhat simplistic, it has paved the way for feminist theorizing without gender, and humanities work without the human (as its centrepieces). Following from, and responsive to, the corporeal and materialist feminist philo- sophizing of diverse and wide-ranging scholars such as Braidotti (1994), Grosz (1994), Hayles (1999), Tuana (1989), Haraway, and many others, the time is ripe for gathering such e…

However, it is the double touching initially which conveys the chiasm in/ between which that unity is interposed: ‘. . . if these experiences never exactly overlap, if they slip away at the very moment they are about to rejoin, if there is always a “shift,” a “spread,” between them, this is precisely because my two hands are part of the same body’ (1968: 148). The unique contribution of the double touching is that in its reversibility it is a contact with the other which is always imminent, but never realized. Unlike the distance separating the seer from the specular body which is required for mirror reflection, the spacing of the two hands touching conveys a sense of unity in the folding back upon itself of the sa…

As she puts it, ‘The kinds of world that we inhabit, and our understanding of our places in these worlds are to some extent an effect of the ways in which we understand space and time.’ I have chosen to include this chapter because it offers a parallel vantage point to that of techno theory from which to consider both the ‘space-time of lived bodies’ and representations of female corporeality.

Women are the subjects of feminism, its initiators, its makers, its force; the move and the join from being a woman to being a feminist is the grasp of that subjecthood. Men are the objects, part of the analysis, agents of the structure to be transformed, representatives in, carriers of the patriarchal mode; and my desire to be a subject there too in feminism—to be a feminist—is then only also the last feint in the long history of their colonization. Which does not mean, of course not, that I can do nothing in my life, that no actions are open to me, that I cannot respond to and change for feminism (that would be a variant on the usual justification for the status quo, men are men and that’s that); it just means that I have to realize nevertheless—and this is an effort not a platitude—that I am not …

description of the Mirror Stage is noteworthy for its specific application to Stephen’s growth in Chapter 2. He writes: “The mirror stage is a drama whose internal thrust is precipitated from insufficiency to anticipation.” If we synthesize Jung’s anima theory with Lacan’s notion of the Mirror Stage, it might be argued that Stephen’s self-directed gaze in the maternal mirror signifies his desire to move from a state of “insufficiency” to one of “anticipation” for a merging encounter with the anima (and the forgotten or repressed mother-image). Thus, he cross-dresses his psyche at the liminal threshold of the mirror—one of the earlier narrative indicators that Stephen’s

PREFACE Ten Points to Begin 1 Is there any remaining doubt that we are now fully within the Episteme of the Affect? Must one even begin an argument anymore by refuting Fredric Jameson’s infamous description of the “waning of affect” in postmodernity? One need not linger in the humanities but might consider newly resurgent neuroscientific work on the emotions; one need not even concern oneself only with scholarship but note the untamed mobility of affects such as terror and disgust, anxiety and hope, in political and popular debates of the early twenty-­first century. Indeed, the importance of affectivity has been so well documented in the disciplines of psychiatry, psychoanalysis, literary theory, critical theory, feminist and race studies, philosophy, and studies in represen- tation, including film and new media, that several scholars have started asking broad questions about …

rendering, is not that inexpressible something that destroys communica- tion or marks an exit from one’s existence in language. Instead, it makes a claim asking for acknowledgment, which may be given or denied. In either case, it is not a referential statement that is simply pointing to an inner object. (70; emphasis mine) With this account of pain’s relationship to language—not only words or meta- phors, but also claims and stories—Das moves her argument out of the dialec- tic of certainty and doubt. She allows us to see expressions of pain as social, contingent, and meaningful in specific, local situations. Through language, a person in pain can speak and receive an acknowledgment of suffering that reconnects him or her to others and the world outside pain. In “Language and Body,” Das does not explicitly define “acknowledg- ment”—or its relationship to empathy or compassion. Els…

things the great variation of styles and forms of masculinity in diﬀerent cultures and countries. Our understanding of the ways in which sexual identities are constructed, interrogated and called forth by dis- cursive practices also owes a great deal to the work of Judith Butler in Bodies That Matter (Butler, 1993) and Gender Trouble (Butler, 1999). Her work has had an extensive inﬂuence on the ﬁeld of body studies, including the study of religion and the body (Armour and St. Ville, 2006). In modern secular societies, feminism, gay liberation and women’s movements have articulated a range of claims for social equality and access to alternative sexual, familial or coupling arrangements, such as gay and lesbian marriage. These legal and scientiﬁc changes create the conditions for experiments in reproductive relationships that constitute a radical challenge to both traditional religion and …

Closing section I, Mireille Calle-Gruber heralds a poetics improvised from the interrelated tropes of orality (music, breath, utterance and silence) and navigation (water, sailing, portaging and bridging) in Cixous’ novel Beethoven à jamais où l’existence de Dieu (1993). Devoted to theoretically contextualizing Cixous’ prose fiction, the second section is aptly introduced by Martine Motard-Noar, who surveys the extent to which Cixous’ fictional and critical writings interrelate. For Motard-Noar, the central challenge facing Cixous critics is the temporary delimitation of Cixous-the- writer as Cixous-the-critic. This necessary analytical task is made especially difficult given Cixous’ sense of the indivisible union of fiction and criticism, her understanding that writing is rereading and that reading is writing. Claudine Fisher continues exploration of Cixous’ fiction, focusing on …

I indicated already that desire, despite its centrality to earlier Deleuzian texts, oddly absents itself from the Cinema volumes. I indicated, too, that several fi lms whose erotics one is loath to reduce to hetero or homo models suggest an es- sentially productive desire, as Deleuze and Guattari theorize it. Exacerbating the irony in the fi rst claim and the sense of missed opportunity in the second, Deleuzian desire does subsist in the Cinema books—unacknowledged as such—at the level of conceptual structures. Th eir ideas about how images function, how they relate to each other, and how they signify beyond them- selves echo the models of desiring-production in Anti-Oedipus . Still, hardly anyone acknowledges this, and certainly Deleuze himself does not. 45 Among

The 80s saw, among others, the emergence—or, rather, the popularization—of cyberpunk with Pat Cadigan ( Mindplayer , 1987) and Melissa Scott being among its most prominent female representatives. 80s science fi ction marks the passage from woman to women. Donna Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century” tackles the universal, totalizing ambitions of both Marxist and radical feminist theories. 14 Revealing the feminist shortcomings in terms of understanding the experiential specifi cities on the level of race, class, and sexuality, Haraway analyzes the inherent fragmentation of both individual and communities and the irrelevance of the concept of identity itself. 15, 16 On the level of gothic horror, women writers embrace, refute, or…

32 I Reading Like a Feminist the subaltern; in other words, when put into practice by the dispos- sessed themselves, essentialism can be powerfully displacing and dis- ruptive. This, to me, signals an exciting new way to rethink the problem of essentialism; it represents an approach which evaluates the motiva- tions behind the deployment of essentialism rather than prematurely dismissing it as an unfortunate vestige of patriarchy (itself an essential- ist category). I do, however, have some serious reservations about treating essen- tialism as "a strategy for our times" (207). While I would agree with Spivak that a provisional return to essentialism can successfully oper- ate, in particular contexts, as an interventionary strategy, I am also compelled to wonder at what point does this move cease to be provi- sional and become permanent? There is always a danger that the long- term …

11 introduction also to our collective understanding of the boundaries between sense and life, or between the human and the non-human. The essays included in Part Four of this volume constitute an important self-questioning on Malabou’s part in relation to the fundamentals of her thought and what one might call the darker side of plasticity. If the emphasis has hitherto been on the productive, transformative and ‘freeing’ capacities of plasticity, here the question of its destructive power is posed, including whether destruction itself can be said to have a form. Annihilation, erasure and therefore the negativity that was always at the beginning a key operation of the Hegelian dialectic now come directly into the foreground. For a new form to emerge, any prior given form must necessarily be erased. This question is posed in relation to the conceptual forms of thinkers on whom M…

Frames of Anime 14 Kristeva accords the chora as “part of the discourse of representation that offers it as evidence,” she concludes that it can never acquire an “axiomatic form.” This is so as the receptacle-space is conditioned to be everywhere and yet nowhere. Because the forefront is occupied by a paternal functional symbolic where linguistic structures are the means and the make-up of its operational milieu, the chora is reduced to the semiotic realm where the psychical, rhythmic, and maternal are some of its salient characteristics. According to Kristeva, both the symbolic and the semiotic are in a dialectical relationship and the significance is in this heterogeneous process. Another French philosopher, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, proposes a “theory of reversibility” by which he stresses the intersubjectivity and interactiveness of human communication that are already set wit…

symbolic (metaphorically suggested by Abramovic's use of language). But for all the seeming emphasis on those two psy- chic phenomena, Abramovic's attempts to mirror Ulay's identity suggest that the real corollary for this performance is the mirror stage. As Lacan makes clear, the mirror stage, especially its early moments, does not necessitate an actual mirror. For example, echoed sounds can suffice to introduce rudimentary notions of self-identity.2 The key point is that one knows oneself through representa- tions, and at the mirror stage the child realizes that representations of the self, whether they be images or sounds, are not the same thing as the self. Lacan describes the mirror stage as "a drama whose internal thrust is pre- cipitated from insufficiency to anticipa- tion—and which manufactures for the 31 Y 3

earlier, the city dwellers no longer came out this way, and the peasants too were leaving the ﬁelds until it was time for their winter work. The country was still green and pleasant, but it was deserted and many of the leaves had fallen; everything gave an impression of solitude and impending winter. This picture evoked mixed feelings of gentle sadness which were too closely akin to my age and my experience for me not to make the comparison. I saw myself at the close of an innocent and unhappy life, with a soul still full of intense feelings and a mind still adorned with a few ﬂowers, even if they were already blighted by sadness and withered by care. Alone and neglected, I could feel the approach of the ﬁrst frosts and my failing imagination no longer ﬁlled my solitude with beings formed after the desires of my heart’’ (Rousseau [1979], 37).3 The landscape is here consciously being read as both an echo and a projection of the psychic state.

There comes a moment, Bronfen says, when `he now fully possesses the knowledge she had', and she goes on to amplify this by saying that `Ligeia is the complete possession of her lover'. This is the first textual crux, the first aporia in Bronfen to which I want to call attention, and I shall return to it below when I look at the tale in more detail, but perhaps it will indicate the next direc- tions of my argument (and feasibly save some unnecessary expend- iture of labour on reading) if I say now that this appears to be an undecidable sentence. From this phrasing we are meant to infer that Ligeia becomes completely subjected to her lover; but as soon as we begin to think of unambiguous equivalents which will employ any modu…

“women’s” marginalized discourse is, at least on a strategic, functional level, paradigmatic rather than real. As a structural paradigm, Kristeva’s feminist/linguistic revision of Lacan’s construct of the semiotic and the sym- bolic can be used most productively in concrete critical analysis of narrative strategies, rather than simply as abstract representation buried beneath the totality of the text. According to Kristeva, the function of the primal, chaotic, inarticulate semiotic, identiﬁed with but not exclusive to woman, is to challenge, disrupt, and otherwise undermine the symbolic, which is usually identiﬁed as male and realized in established phallogocentric discourse. In order to do so effectively and on the same plane, the semiotic must, however, ﬁrst articulate itself; and this is accomplished through a transition out of the semiotic and into the thetic, the place where semioti…

Her general strategy relies upon confronting psychoanaly- sis with examples and cases taken from contemporary neurosci- ence, instances in which “it is not possible to separate the organic wound from its psychical repercussions.”1 To be more specific, she sees “the new wounded” (les nouveaux blessés) of neuropathology – the ranks of this corps include Alzheimer’s patients, sufferers of senile dementia, and all those with various kinds of brain damage or neurophysiological alterations resulting from disease, injury, malnutrition, poverty, war, and/or substance abuse – as disturbing figures facing analysis with what, allegedly up until now, it has failed to recognize as incarnations of its conceptual and curative limits.2 Those unfortunates whose socio-symbolic selfhood is

the central Bataillean notion of the 'general economy', given its emergence as an effect of cultural systems of rejection, prohibition and taboo. The 'inner experience' of eroticism is, of course, bound up with the transgres­ sion that defines both the limit of human systems of productivity and the place of the particular being in relation to them. Where culture recoils in horror from death, decay, filth and sexuality, it restores its homogeneous limits and binds individuals to its service. Eroticism's transgression of boundaries turns, thereby, on abjected forms of existence, animal, sexual and taboo, 'leaping into the unknown, with animality as its impetus' (p. 251). From such expenditure of natural energies, in its embrace of the rejected, profane world, eroticism paradoxically accedes to the sphere of the sacred, negating nature, precisely through its adoration of the base …

Nevertheless, these aspects share a great deal with Minakata’s em- phasis on ecological life as the productive energy grounding all socio- political systems. The notion of the immunologically mutual contamination of hege- monic power with subjective freedom that I find in Tanabe’s dialectical philosophy and Minakata’s biophilosophy finds a contemporary corre- late in Michel Foucault’s theory of power. Intending to delineate a mod- ern form of power following on the heels of the breakdown of early modern disciplinary power (which solicited docility and demanded con- finement), Foucault’s understanding of biopolitics is, in my view, con- sistent with the philosophical architecture of Minakata and Tanabe. Although he later deployed his theory of power in multiple ways, the

This exchange between self and other at the heart of Lispector's fiction is not peaceful, but instead is charged with double-edged violent forces. The passionate aspect of Lispector's writing, which many critics have noted and which Lispector herself stresses —in the title of A paixdo segundo G.H. (1964; The Passion ac- cording to G.H.), for example —involves not only the quest for positive connec- tions, as in the passion of love, or the intense introspection of her characters, who seek contact with truths that reason cannot fathom or represent. It also includes the sacrificial impulse that sparks her fictional imagination: a via crucis, with its Christian resonances of suffering in place of and for the sake of another, a process that does not always follow ethical and moral precepts, and that may be required of the characters as well as suffered by their author. In a closing autobiogra…

1 Reflections on Ethics, Destructiveness, and Life: Rosi Braidotti and the Posthuman Judith Butler Abstract This chapter engages with Rosi Braidotti’s affirmative ethical response to contemporary destructiveness and toxic forms. Braidotti’s notion of the posthuman, conceived as a dynamic amalgam of animal, machinic, technical, digital, organic, inorganic, viral, and capitalist dimensions, is considered as a welcome alternative to Agamben’s notion of bare life. Braidotti’s distinction between “sustainable” and “perverse” modalities is discussed in relation to what might be thought of as more than a simplistic opposition, challenging us to think of life in terms of intensities and becomings. Keywords Posthuman, destructiveness, affirmation, sustainability, transpositions It is a great honor to write a short piece on, and for, Rosi Braidotti on this occasion. I would like to take ad…

in understanding the “relationship between emotion and the ‘public sphere’ ”. In this regard Gorton recognises an important gap in the areas of theorising by feminists including Probyn (2005) and Ahmed (2004), which is the under- standing of “desire” as a concept. As Gorton (2007: 345) comments: “how are we to theorize desire after the affective turn?” It is perhaps the preoccupation with a process of reflexivity in its own position which has led feminists to ignore desire in their analysis. Feminism and feminist scholars are interested in the links between affect and feminism because they recognise the links between “affect and gendered, sexualised, racialised and classed relations of power” (Pedwell and White- head 2012: 116).

and moral aspect. To the physician or the naturalist, the relation of woman to man is "a series of oppositions and contrasts." 15 In place of what, in certain situations, strikes the modern imagination as an almost perverse insistence on understanding sexual difference as a matter of de- gree, gradations of one basic male type, there arose a shrill call to articu- late sharp corporeal distinctions. Doctors claimed to be able to identify "the essential features that belong to her, that serve to distinguish her, that make her what she is": All parts of her body present the same differences: all express woman; the brow, the nose, the eyes, the mouth, the ears, the chin, the cheeks. If we shift our view to the inside, and with the help of the scalpel, lay bare the organs, the tissues, the fibers, we encounter everywhere ... the same differ- ence.16 Thus the old model, in which men …

practice and feeds ‘the mutually-reinforcing poles of academic- élitism and anti- intellectualism’ (Sayer, 1984/1992 : 98). This has great relevance in the context of feminist accounts of heterosexual love, which too often fail to theoretically acknowledge and integrate the good reasons women have for loving men, even when it reproduces their subordination. In its tendency to reduce women’s love of men to a matter of patriarchal ideology (Jónasdóttir, 2014 ), feminism has failed to make sense of women’s lived reality, thereby, as hooks ( 2002 ) points out, alienating the majority of women from feminism. Instead of understanding power only as an effect of discourse or ideology or in the radical feminist terms of dominance and violence, Jónasdóttir anchors her account of oppressive power in a notion of the basic, creative power we have as sexual beings. She aligns with the view of the agency/structure relation endorsed

Page 343 Platonic term, Jacqueline Rose reminds us that Plato describes the chora as maternal because the mother is seen in his text as "playing no part in the act of procreation" (Rose 1986, 153–154). Yet Kristeva is interested in the term because already in the Platonic text it is caught in a "bastard reasoning," which on the one hand insists on the distinction between the passive and the active, but on the other hand describes chora as both the passive receptacle and the active movement. For a more detailed discussion, see Kristeva (1984, 239–240, nn. 12 and 13). 8. This aspect of Kristeva's work is emphasized by Lewis (1974, 29). 9. In her earlier article, Domna C. Stanton interprets these irruptions of the semiotic as manifestations of negativity and dissidence (Stanton 1987, 75). 10. Judith Butler argues that what Kristeva discovers as a natural prediscursive maternal subversion…

Even if ignored or outright denied, its interpellation does not cease and, when heeded, the other’s call intensi- fies its centrifugal pull. If one adds to this description of ethical assignation Levinas’s corporal language and jarring images where the self is tormented and obsessed in its responsibility to the other, then the idea of phantom per- secution films embodying the ethical relationship do not seem as far-fetched. Not only does Levinas undercut any rationalist explanations for moral obliga- tion to the other, rendering our responsibility to the other ethereal and spec- tral, but he also affirms that responsibility never stops or attains closure (cf. for instance, 1990, 149; 1996a, 144).

14 BODIES IN PAIN affective consequences for the spectator. For me, one of the most important themes in his work is the notion of ‘bodies in pain’ as theorized by Elaine Scarry (1985). Therefore, one of the goals of this book is to investigate how such pain is directly ‘transmitted’ to the spectator, as a phenomenon that is simultaneously a sensation and an emotion (Jackson 1994: 201). For many philosophers of pain, the state of pain disrupts the intentionality of the body; even more keenly, pain disrupts the relationship between the lived-body and the world. In pain, one may experience one’s body as an ‘alien presence’ (Leder 1990: 73) because it appears as strange, or ‘other’, to one, becoming an object instead of a subject of experience. While in normal circumstances the body is the locus from which one directs one’s attention to the world, in pain the body becomes an objec…

If there is comedy in this, it is the overheated comedy of all Futurist manifestos (think of Marinetti or Artaud) that invoke a too-strenuous ideal for ordinary humans such as the reader to follow, much less take seriously. The truth is that, even at the time, Sontag did not argue that all interpretation was bad. There were historical moments, she noted, when cer- tain types of interpretation could be liberating, as was the case with Marx and Freud. But our own era suffered, in her opinion, from a surfeit of interpretation, which stifled us and got in the way of our ability to experience the world head- on.* The paradox—it scarcely needs saying—is * Roland Barthes showed a similar antagonism to verbal

of the subject of life is written into his analysis of how the very existence of sovereignty is founded on the power to exclude that subject, the homo sacer. His proposition for the matter of life, on the other hand, is contained in his critique of how the Western tradition of political thought has divided what he will call bios from zoe, a distinction which stands in need of rigorous questioning. A ready foil for this analysis of Agamben is found in the work of René Girard. Girard’s work has been contrasted several times with Agamben’s in recent scholarship but not yet in ways that address this key question of life. While Colby Dickinson has analysed the correlations between Agamben and Girard on the topic of mimesis, and Christopher A. Fox has considered the ways in which these two major critics have distinguished and differentiated politics and religion, Frederiek Depoortere has cast doubts over the solidity of Agamben’s analysis of homo sacer

Even so, in stressing the shameful experience of nudity as the accompaniment to the failure of pleasure, the promises, pleasures and failures of physical love (eros) are inevitably (albeit rather coyly) suggested. In this, the text prefigures the important discussion of eros in Existence and Existents, Time and the Other and Totality and Infinity. Echoes of De I'evasion resound most clearly in Existence and Existents, where the specificity and extraordinary potentiality of eros — its prospects, that is, as the subject of a phenomenology — are explained by distinguishing between the two pleasures of eating and love (amour). Love, Levinas says, is characterized by an essential and insatiable hunger. Unlike the desire to eat, amorous desire is not merely an agitation (trouble) that precedes the attempt at gratification, but is a desire augmented by such an attempt. In love, L…

6 INTRODUCTION unlike painting or sculpture, are both explicitly time-based media.” 15 The particular arrangement of time constitutes a ﬁ lm as a work of art as much as the visual images that the ﬁ lm presents. Even ﬁ lms that primarily present a series of still images, like Chris Marker’s La Jetée (1962), nonetheless highlight temporality through their avoidance of the moving image. Every ﬁ lm betrays some particular conception of temporality. 16 For many theorists, the genius of cinema lies in its ability to permit the spectator an authentic experience of time without the obstacles that confound the experience of time outside the cinema. While watching a ﬁ lm that highlights the movement of time, specta- tors ﬁ nd themselves submitted to time rather than feeling themselves separated from its movement, which is the position that we tend to occupy in our everyday lives. Film alerts us to the constitutive role

Finally, Angela Willey’s explora- tions of monogamy have also drawn on Lorde’s theorizations of erotics as distinct from sexuality. Like me, Willey sees in the erotic the possibility for thinking beyond sexual paradigms as they have been formulated. Further, the erotic for Willey opens up opportunities for critiquing sexuality itself. In her own words, “we must be willing to critique sexuality as we know it in order to understand . . . the erotic body. If we understand ourselves as ‘erotic,’

Setting out to understand the signifying process (signifiance), Kristeva transforms Lacan's distinction between the imaginary and the symbolic order into a distinction between the semiotic and the symbolic. The interaction between these two terms (which, it must be stressed, are processes, not static entities) then constitutes the signifying process. The semiotic is linked to the pre-Oedipal primary processes, the basic pulsions of which Kristeva sees as predominantly anal and oral, and as simultaneously dichotomous (life/death, expulsion/introjection) and heterogeneous. The endless flow of pulsions is gathered up in the chora (from the Greek word for enclosed space, womb). Kristeva appropriates and redefines

from the trauma she also experienced in the car accident. Although Sarah and La Femme are both grieving the loss of their loved ones, they are opposites in almost every other way. One is a villain and the other is a victim; one is cloaked in black and the other dons a white nightgown; one is without a child and the other is heavily pregnant; and ﬁnally, one desperately wishes to be a mother and the other does not. The spectator, therefore, becomes more inclined to sympathize with La Femme because she is a mother who is unable to cope with the loss of her child. In this sense, the extreme violence perpetrated by La Femme seems to be more meaningful and almost rationalized. Le Femme is everything a modern woman is not supposed to be, and yet, under patriarchal culture, she may end up the hero for killing the ‘unnatural’ non-maternal woman. As the battle rages between Sarah and La Femme, Inside investigates what the female body as the site of life can tolerate. One of the ways

Patterns of Dissonance develops the category of “bodily materialism” for this feminist philosophical movement of which Braidotti considered herself, or her work, to be a part.

While with the notion of network she has a tool that makes a positive empirical investigation possible, for each value her networks purport to convey she has only an ineffable “je ne sais quoi,” as finely honed as it is ungraspable. But we are dealing with a true anthropologist: she knows that she must not abandon either the empirical investigation or the certainty that those “somethings” through which values are defined are going to lead her someplace.

Yet, it is precisely this act of stripping that retains a highly ambiguous status in Agamben’s ontological ediﬁce. As we have noted in our discussion of Bartleby and Michael K, the former ﬁgure is, for Agamben, an epitome of potential being precisely because his pure refusal is not an act of will or a decision to resist but a state of always already dwelling in pure potentiality, in the suspension of every preference by an absolutised preference-not-to. At this stage, we may reiterate our initial scepticism with regard to this reading, particularly insofar as it is posited as a metaphorical guideline to a ‘happy life’ that is wholly exhausted in bare life.

Scarry’s observation about the inexpressibility of pain by language is that it bears on the difficulty of representing a phe- nomenon politically (12).

It suggests that a film, for a man, is a double pleasure, a visual and a narrative pleasure. For a WOITIan it offers identification with a fe,male figure who is framed by the camera as an image, an icon, the object of the male gaze, whose , look is relayed by the look of a male character acting as surrogate spectator. It see'ms to' offer little help with, for exalnple, a narrative with a female protagonist, or one that objectifies a male character.

lacks noted above (of object, jouissance and being) indicates that for Lacan each such aspect of the subject is best grasped not within the parameters of the object—that is, as an entity capable of a clear ontological status—but rather according to a trajectory of lack. The ego can accordingly be conceptualized as simultaneously caught up within, and formed by, the wishful illusion of its own substantiality. The culture of the ego In Seminar I Lacan warns his audience that there is a fundamental error in cleaving “to the idea that the subject’s ego is identical to the presence that is speaking to you.”52 This is the problem when an “objectifying case of mind” (that is, a psychologizing approach) slides from the ego defined as the perception-consciousness system—that is, as the system of the subject’s objectifications—to the ego conceived of as the correlate of an absolute real…

Introduction In mental life nothing which has once been formed can perish. —Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents Thought cannot welcome that which it bears within itself and which sustains it, except by forgetting. —Blanchot, The Writing of the Disaster The archive always works, and a priori, against itself. —Derrida, Archive Fever: A Freudian Impression Preamble Melancholy and the Archive fi nds its impetus and inspiration in a series of frustrations. I have been a serious reader of Freud and Derrida for decades; their work, specifi cally that dealing with ideas of loss, memory, and mourn- ing, has deeply informed my readings of a variety of modern and contem- porary writers. It is safe to say that without Beyond the Pleasure Principle, “Mourning and Melancholia,” Archive Fever, or The Ear of the Other, I (and of course others) would not have been able to begin to think carefully about the complex protocols of memory and trauma at work in contemporary

First appearing in the UK journal Screen, Mulvey’s formulation marked a watershed in Film Studies, literary theory, and art history (Kipnis, Ecstasy 8). Its indelible imprint continues to be felt throughout academe and beyond (Walters 53; Lane, “Lady”; Butterfield 14). This discursive diffusion extends beyond naming and describing the male gaze. Mulvey’s argument and analysis aimed to make both heuristic and “political use” of her concept to explain and resist the impact of male gazing. Some critics now argue that as an instrument of both resistance and explanation Mulvey’s 1975 case for an “alternative cinema” still functions as a manifesto for a more encompassing movement, a rallying cry for the nebulous sensibility that Laura Kipnis has characterized as an ideologically contradictory “left aesthetic vanguardism” (Ecstasy 108). As a result, refreshing and provocative as it once was, the phrase “the male gaze” now confounds at least as often as it clarifies.

Julia Kristeva and Feminist Thought 24 in a critical encounter with the writings of the key ﬁ gures of structuralism, post-structuralism, psychoanalysis and Marxism, is particularly important to a feminist interpretation of her work, because it sheds a light on her relationship with structuralism (I return to this point later) and on the role of agency. Early on in Revolution in Poetic Language, Kristeva identiﬁ es two linguistic traditions, both highly inﬂ uential during the 1960s, which, in her view, and notwithstanding substantial differences between them, share a series of problematic features. One is Saussurean structuralism; the other is the rationalist humanism of Generative Grammar. Both traditions, according to Kristeva, are void of social-economic and historical references (see also Kristeva 1973a), and they ignore how subject and language are shaped by bodily drive…

portant question arises in our midst: noting his characterization as al- ready stated, why on earth would anyone want to read the old pessimist Cioran? In exploring the ways in which Cioran deploys the fragment, we will aim to show how pessimism, which, as Eugene Thacker suggests, “is the lowest form of philosophy, frequently disparaged and dismissed, merely the symptom of a bad attitude” (“Cosmic Pessimism” 66), holds a close relation to the notion of “failed mysticism” and that, against its relegation to the margins of philosophy and despite its futility, what the scholarly world actually needs—and secretly, even if unknowingly, begs for—is more pessimism. It is difficult to explain the intense and acerbic nature of his pessi- mism, especially given the complicated character of his personal, politi- cal, and intellectual lives. In fact, we will leave the vast intricacies of that ardent task to his past and future biographers, as that continues to re-

Even to start this experiment, I have to rethink some of the terms that I am used to, engaging in a kind of self-overcoming or even a “reassembling” in relation to her for which I may not be fully prepared. When I consider that recent work on the effects of neoliberalism and global capitalism has, in part, focused on ways in which labor has become intermittent and precarious, futures have become foreclosed, and populations have become dispensable or ungrievable, I see that Braidotti’s work asks us to redescribe or reapproach such phenomena. She does not doubt the pervasive character of exploitation or even the “perversions” of commodification and technological innovations that do serious damage and ought rightly to be called destructive. Indeed, it seems clear to me, at least, that she distinguishes between sustaining and destructive modes of technological reassembly (including…

Film alerts us to the constitutive role that time plays in our existence. 17 In ﬁ lms that produce what Gilles Deleuze calls time-images, time becomes the source of action and movement rather than just the arena in which movement occurs, as it is in what he calls the movement-image. Though he sees the time- image emerging in the post–World War II era with Italian Neorealism and the ﬁ lms of Orson Welles, Deleuze believes that it nonetheless represents the essence of cinematic art. 18 The time-image shows the ontological priority of time by taking the focus away from action that unfolds in chronological or spatialized time. Instead, the specta- tor experiences time directly through, say, Welles’s depth of ﬁ eld, which juxtaposes past and present in a single shot. Early cinema’s focus on the priority of movement—evident in ﬁ lms as disparate as

their sexual desires. Collier's concern here is less with the language itself than it is with connection between words and action. He uses Euripides' Phaedra as an example of a woman possessed by an "infamous Passion" who nonetheless concealed her desire, remaining "regular and reserv'd in her Language" and thus managed to retain her modesty (9-10). For him, Phaedra's chaste language represents a deeper sexual virtue. She feels an "infamous Passion," but because she does not express it, it re- mains cloaked and ultimately destroyed. In contrast, openly sexual lan- guage not only expresses improper appetites but in itself engenders these appetites. Here Collier turns quickly from language to action, arguing that playwrights deliberately depict women as mad or silly in order to "enlarge their Liberty" (10), to allow them to behave in an openly sexual manner. Speech thus provides the opportunity for action. Collier's second objection develops directly out of his apprehension

the industrialized slaughter of animals and the extinction of non- domesticated species. These investigations test the borders that liberal Enlightenment humanism has established between the hu- man and the nonhuman, and some radical gothic is involved in a programmatic critique of the human–­animal distinction and of the routine violence done to nonhuman animal bodies. Such texts par- ticipate in the furthering of what Braidotti has termed a material vitalism that dislocates “difference from binaries to rhizomatics, from sex-­gender or nature-­culture to processes of differing that take life itself, or the vitality of matter, as the main subject.”46 Even conservative gothic that insists on absolute borders between the human and an animality imagined as monstrous draw attention to the entwined nature of these categories and the porousness of this imagined border.

be termed ‘phenomenological’ in so far as it seeks to describe the correlation of body and world that exists in pre-reflective perception. His later work does not constitute a break with this. Rather, it seeks to deepen our understanding of this correlation in the direction of an ontology. This more concentrated scope of Merleau-Ponty’s investigations is manifest in the fact that he now focuses his attention specifically on the phenomenon of visibility. For example, in the essay ‘Eye and Mind’ we are told that the body is a thing, ‘But because it moves itself and sees, it holds things in a circle around itself. Things are an annex or prolongation of itself; they are incrusted into its flesh, they are part of its full definition.’6 But why are ‘things’ a part of the embodied subject’s ‘full definition’ ? Well, the answer to this is already hinted at in Merleau-Ponty’s

The companion essay, AIDS and its Metaphors (1989) examines the dangerous, prejudicial view of AIDS as a consequence of decadence, and therefore as a judgement on certain ways of life.

we can productively read Malabou’s work as representative of political-aesthetic manifesto writing. As in the previous section of this chapter, however, I do not intend to present this characterization as the definitive or even best representation of Malabou’s work, but to introduce a new motor scheme or image through which her efforts can be interpreted and, more importantly, reproduced and extended. Malabou’s texts have been described as manifestos by commentators such as Clayton Crockett,31 and Malabou herself refers to Plasticity at the Dusk of Writing as a “text-manifesto”;32 nonetheless, these descriptions have not been explored in significant depth. There are, in fact, close resemblances between generally agreed-upon characteristics of the manifesto and the philosophical form of responsibility we have identified with Malabou’s writings on plasticity. Most superficially, the manifesto is intimately connected to

In like manner, posthumanist Karen Barad, another crucial figure in close relation to the new materialisms, has, against a background in theoretical physics, advanced a theory of “agential realism,” according to which “questions of ethics and of justice are always already threaded through the very fabric of the world.”38 As a consequence, she argues, for example,39 that human ethics must be founded on the inhuman, subatomic reality characterized by infinite potentiality, as quantum physics allows for the emergence of pairs of particles and antiparticles out of empty space. This might look like a simple category-mistake, but when we recall that there is no principal ontological difference between the subjective and

behaviour, a particular clothing, etc. But if one understands feminin- ity—as Butler does—as something acquired in the course of childhood development, as the result of identifications, then gender identity, too, is always about imitation. Butler comes to the following conclusion: “drag imitates the imitative structure of gender, revealing gender itself as an imitation” (Butler, 1993a, p. 176). To formulate gender as “imita- tion” may seem strange, for gender identity, in particular, seems to us to be a fixed, nature-given core of our identity. The deconstructionist argu- ment, however, aims precisely to question this seeming naturalness and reveal that it is socially constructed. What remains open is through which forms of exclusion and “foreclos- ure” the performance of gender occurs. How is the phenomenon of gen- der melancholy connected with the practice of gender performance? …

implications of David’s unresolved desires for his mother Ann Bell and for subsequent mother-substitutes, particularly the sculptor Sullivan. Freudian readings of Americana are valid and indeed necessary, but I fi nd that they only take us so far. Peeling past the label of American Oedipus, I offer a Lacan-infl ected reconsideration of the novel as a distorted and destabilized treatment of the postmodern subject. Viewed from this vantage, Americana appears less a portrait of the American Oedipus and more a refl ection from the shimmering pool of the American Narcissus. Lacan’s Mirror Stage is invaluable to understanding David Bell’s construction of self. The primary narcissism that characterizes infantile ego development remains startlingly active in his adult inter- and intra-personal relationships, and this mirror effect is magnifi ed in his attraction to fi lm.

(Recall the canonical example of the Auschwitz commandant returning home in the evening, embracing his wife and children, and sitting at the piano to play some Schubert before dinner.) People don't be- come inured to what they are shown-if that's the right way to describe what happens- because of the quantity of images dumped on them. It is passivity that dulls feeling. The states described as apathy, moral or emotional anes- thesia, are full of feelings; the feelings are rage and frustration. But if we consider what emotions would be desirable, it seems too simple to elect sympathy. The imaginary proximity to the suffering inflicted on others that is granted by images suggests a link between the far- away sufferers- seen close-up on the television screen- and the privileged viewer that is simply untrue, that is yet

particular task that is hers: the deflowering of a Virgin. And finally, capitalizing upon the old myth concerning the ability of dogs and children to intuitively recognize evil, Coleridge has the toothless guardian of the dying life in the castle, the mastiff bitch, growl in her sleep as this intruder into the decaying scene passes; and the fire which is almost dead, momentarily is rekindled by her presence. However, it seems highly significant that each of these clues to the evil nature of the enchantress can be symbolical- ly interpreted as a clue to her sexual, perhaps life-giving nature as well. Of course the mastiff bitch, whom we have previously seen as a symbol of the dying life in the castle, will react to a threat against what she symbolizes. And although the flames may respond to the master of the flames, they are also means of providing warmth and heat. Geraldine is, I think, being presented here on two distinct

hand, the danger is evident in the male aspiration to be infinite. On the other hand, there would seem to be a similar danger in the female aspiration to become divine. With an aspiration to be all there is a subject eclipses others. A critical embrace of bodies would reform this aspiration and our thinking. It should also challenge our physical, sensual and material relations with others. hooks's conception of yearning is compatible with the political intent of contemporary feminist philosophy to develop social epistemology. The core concern in feminist social epistemology is to see reality from alternative points of view, i.e. to refuse to allow inertia to blind us from the reality of other lives and so a larger social world than one's own. Moore and Ricoeur each account for the inevitable finitude of a person's point of view. Moreover, the tradition going back to Augustine exhibits two sorts of responses to this

He explains the functions and the locations of punctum and studium, and he also points out that by chance punctum and studium may co-exist in one photograph. Marianne Hirsh borrows Barthes’ ideas of punctum and studium and further interprets the relationship between the spectator and the photos. She points out that the referent of a photo is both “present (implied in the photograph) and absent (it has been there…

appears to function as an empty signifier, this is not entirely incorrect. It refers to that which may not be referred to, in the sense of that which escapes but conditions reference itself. This is worth stressing in relation to the idea of 'the Other', which has achieved such prominence in the reception of Levinas's work, as the compel- ling phenomenological aspect of the description of the ethical relation tends to obscure the formal, metaphysical principle which underlies it. The notion of the Other occupies a much more complex position than the main tendency in many current theoretical appropriations of Levinas's work would suggest. The Other is not a foundational category for Levinas. It does not appear fully- formed and un-birthed, as it were, as the unquestioned and unquestionable pre-philosophical ground of experience and thence of philosophy. The assumption that it does overlooks the fact that it is, precisely, a philosophical

the symptoms of some kind of malady of the soul, literature can be cathartic. This is certainly true for abjection. As Kristeva says of abjection and literature: By suggesting that literature is [abjection’s] privileged signiﬁer, I wish to point out that, far from being a minor, marginal activity in our culture, as a general consensus seems to have it, this kind of literature, or even literature as such, represents the ultimate coding of our crises, of our most intimate and most serious apocalypses. Hence its nocturnal power. (1982: 208) In nearly all of her writings, even the most psychoanalytic ones, she continually turns to literary texts, both as a literary critic seeking to understand the “nocturnal power” of writing and as an analyst trying to understand the author as a subject who is working through his or her crises. Literature, she says, “may also involve not an ultimate resista…

Kristeva’s discussion of poetic language, a term associated with Russian Formalism, draws again extensively on Bakhtin. Poetic language vocalises, like the echolalia of the baby, the materiality and sound of language;8 it is rhythmic and musical (see also Todorov 1988), and it points to the heterogeneity of language and to the exist- ence of a form of language in the margins of the symbolic (DL: 65). This exploration of signiﬁ cation in the margins is a leitmotif of Kristeva’s work, brought to the fore in the attention given to notions of dissidence and singularity (see Chapter 4). The importance of poetic language and, by extension, of the semiotic lies in the potential to …

in the body in yet another and more fundamental way. Kristeva traces the question of what makes words possible (or of what makes having words possible) deeper into the bodily origin of subject formation. My development that leads into the symbolic, into the world of counting and accounting, and therefore my rise to subjectivity, originates in the body. But this originating body is not mine. I develop into a self out of my mother’s body. The semiotic, which is both the basis of the symbolic and that which exceeds its control, develops out of the ﬂow of drives and energies prior to the emergence of self or other and thus prior to the intervention of the Father. As we have already seen, Kristeva uses Plato’s concept of the chora to describe this originating nature of the semiotic.29 In Plato’s picture, it is through the intervention of a male deity impregnating this formless chora…

(205-6) As I have suggested, the different elements in this perverse and perverted game are familiar: voyeurism, exhibitionism, sadism, masochism. The appearance (once again) of Freya's father, and the observing eyes of the narrator, also have their analogues elsewhere in Conrad's fiction. Moreover the use of music to mimic and accompany sexual desire and frustration is a technique that we have also seen Conrad make use of in 'II Conde'. And then there is the reader. If we return to Conrad's 'Author's Note' we must wonder to what extent those many readers who were shocked and upset by the seeming heartlessness of the story's sacrifice of the young lovers are, too, the victims of a sadistic impulse. …

However, Grosz is dissatisﬁed with certain aspects of French psychoanalytic feminism and speciﬁcally with the theories of Kristeva (see Chapter 3 and Chapter 5). In Sexual Subversions (Grosz 1989), for instance, she maintains that Kris- teva’s approach to the body and feminine embodiment is contradictory. Grosz draws attention to Kristeva’s ‘willingness to describe maternity in biological and physiological terms’ and concomitant ‘resistance to attributing any female identity to maternity’ (pp. 80–1). Therefore, Kristeva could be said to both essentialize femininity by linking it closely to the female anatomy and reproductive functions and to further women’s marginaliza…

might appear that in seeming ‘real’ this form of memory is false. But this would be to conflate issues of identity with truth claims about what one has remembered and it is to think of memory only in mimetic terms. In a sense what we are arguing is not so different from what David Freedberg, Alfred Gell and, most recently, C. Stephen Jaeger have argued –​ that texts (perhaps agentially) work to elicit certain reactions from their audiences.78 We would also claim that the way these texts elicit a reaction is by activating memory, leading us (in that now hoary, hyphenated phrase) to re-​member what one could not possibly have witnessed. Is there one par­ ticular way in which one needs to remember? In other words, does each text have one reconstruction that is ‘right’? Or at least more right than others? This is a question of interpretation that depends both on the ability to recreate a text and the ability to

While the work is couched as a debate about the relative merits of the sexes, the discussion ends up being rather lopsided, and threatens to degenerate into an harangue against men. It nevertheless does exhibit women’s capacity for argument: those charged to defend men present reasons in their defense, but these are rebutted by the women charged with defending women. Moreover, reading the work as simply polemical cannot explain the scientific enterprise of the second day. It seems rather that the rather frank and open discussion of the first day, in which the women validate their own worth, while denigrating the way men have represented the female sex, sets up, and…

annihilated by the serenity and intelligence of his imagination. Approving or disapproving morally of what a work of art “says” is just as extraneous as becoming sexually excited by a work of art. (Both are, of course, very common.) And the reasons urged against the propriety and relevance of one apply as well to the other. Indeed, in this notion of the annihilation of the subject we have perhaps the only serious criterion for distinguishing between erotic literature or films or paintings which are art and those which (for want of a better word) one has to call pornography. Pornography has a “content” and is designed to make us connect (with disgust, desire) with that content. It is a substitute for life. But art does not excite; or, if it does, the excitation is appeased, within the terms of the aesthetic experience. All great art induces contemplation, a dynamic contemplation. However …

He thinks the body neither in terms of an object nor simply subjectively but rather as flesh that emerges in the flesh of the world. As we will see, with “flesh” Merleau-Ponty attempts to think the “sensibility” of Being not simply in terms of crude matter but as encompassing the invisible dimensions that belong to it. He calls it an “element”“in the sense of a general thing, midway between the spatiotemporal individual and the idea, a sort of incarnate principle.”3 The flesh of the world is saturated with meaning.This is why it is possible for thought and ideas to emerge from this flesh and, in turn, they carry meaning only insofar as they are sensible. In The Visible and the Invisible Merleau-Ponty calls this bond between flesh and ideas “the most difficult point.”4 It is precisely this point we need to address in our quest to think the bodily dimension in thought and the be- longing of this thought to the brute world in which it originates. a.

It is thus that Judith Butler, again a philosopher by education and professional affiliation and again a writer whose work moves (as many of her critics have pointed out) rapidly from theo- retical assertion to engagements with the ‘real’ world that various writers have found problem- atic, suggests a way through the various confines that binary accounts of gender implicitly offer. The punctuation that explicitly challenges straightforward assumptions of the way in which we read ‘the real’ is to indicate an essential part of Butler’s argument: that the real world is no more or less than our capacity to re-affirm or to destabilize it.

x Preface and Acknowledgments causes the lack-in-being from which desire as a structural motivating principle is born. In this sense, psychosis becomes an empirical proof of Lacan’s theories regarding the differential distinction of all subject positions as a response to the phallic signiﬁer and to the lack-in-being that he names castration. Lacan’s theories require a three-dimensional logic to make sense. Conscious, typical binary thought simply obscures the structure of the unconscious, made up as it is of the symbolic, the imaginary, the real, and the symptom. Thus, any theory that grapples with Lacan’s ideas by reducing them to one of his myriad thoughts risks not understanding the breadth and scope of this teaching. Lacan’s claim that individuals make the world of their thought equal to their own conscious understanding of it is validated in such truncated readings of Lacan. The challenge for any reader is how to

All the essays are linked by their general engagement with questions of sexuality and by a more particular concern with the poet’s interest in the body, or the discursive structures embodied in language and tradition that the poet must negotiate. In this sense the essays collectively argue that poetry dealing with the subject of sexuality is always already about the way we look at our bodies, the world and poetic language itself. What makes this book different, we believe, from other collections is its vibrant diversity. This volume is not an attempt to capture or record any specific tradition or genre, nor is it limited in its scope to a particular temporal and geographical nexus.

Of course, the above model illustrates the most extreme, "language destroy- ing" instances of pain. But when pain is not too intense as to fully curtail the ability to speak, the only way to share that pain (for sympathy, for relief, or for the eventual elimination of that pain) is to find some means of expressing it. Somehow, the pain must be objectified in order that it may be "knowable" to others, and "lifted into the visible world." Scarry hrther explains "ifthe rejerent for these now objectfied attributes is understood to be the human body, then the sentient fact of the person's suffering will become knowable to a second per- son.''39 Scarry's theory of pain and sentience becomes most pertinent to posthu- manism, however, when she proposes that "the felt attributes of pain" can be "attached to a referent other than the human bodyn-a process she calls "ana- logical verif…

desire is movement and therefore, instead of counterpoising these the- oretical models, it seems more useful to examine the ways in which this movement functions and how it can be connected more specifically to recent work on affect. Indeed, as I will go on to argue in Chapter 5, one of the possibilities work on affect offers is a way out of the impasse between psychoanalytic lack and Deleuzian production. Freud’s, Lacan’s and Deleuze and Guattari’s models of desire construct contrasting and opposing interpretations. One could say there is a con- trast here between a negative conceptualisation of desire and a positive or productive one and also a contrast between a (modern) search for meaning and a (postmodern) recognition of multiple interpretations. However, to call one ‘negative’ and the other ‘positive’ only leads us to circular (and endless) debates. Feminist interventions into these debates have drawn attention to the gendered nature of theorisations of desire

In erotic forms of morality, the per- sonal becomes political not through government legislation of in- timacy, but by unmasking individual and social pathologies originating from our failure to take intimacy seriously. I see feeling disorders as symptoms of social and political illness—like the French feminists viewed Victorian hysteria—in a society com- pletely out of touch with erotic life but fully immersed in pornog- raphy, that is, the cultivation of sensations divorced from emotional connections. In Lorde’s words, “To refuse to be con- scious of what we are feeling at any time, however comfortable that might seem, is to . . . allow ourselves to be reduced to the pornographic, the abused, the absurd.”16 In a similar fashion, Nel Noddings, in Caring and Women and Evil, reinterprets evil as anes- thetization to pain.

of his great love for his mother (who has joined him in watching over his dying friend) and of his sadness when he realizes that they will never attempt to put their love into words. Rieux also stands as a representative of those facing personal loss, for he learns of his wife’s death shortly before the quarantine is ended. Because the chronicle is written in retrospect, Rieux is al­ ready bereaved when he begins his account. Kellman suggests that the disguising of Rieux’s identity ensures a “movement from lonely widower to chronicler and back to lonely widower within each sep­ arate reading of the novel,” a movement which “reenacts the meta­ morphosis from solitaire to solidaire so important to Camus.”51 If, as Kellman suggests, each reading reenacts the shift from the sol­ itary to the socially affiliated, this reflects the healing shift in grief from isolation to reconnection …

One strategy for overcoming this problem is Rosi Braidotti’s zoe-centrism, focused on the principle that ‘the relational capacity of the posthuman subject is not confined within our species, but it includes all nonanthropomorphic elements, starting from the air we breathe. Living matter – including embodied human flesh – is intelligent and self-organizing’ (2017: 33). The core problem is precisely this ‘posthu- man subject’: ‘we may yet overcome anthropocentrism by becoming anthropomorphic bodies without organs that are still finding out what they are capable of becoming’ (Braidotti 2017: 35). It remains to be seen just how ‘subjectivised’ such a body could be, since the ‘subject’

As Heidegger maintains, being is being-for-death. What makes us human is being spoken by language, or rather being pervaded by a signiﬁcativity that precedes us and grants us access to the possibility of thinking about our ﬁniteness, the reason for the essential unhappiness of all narcissism. We are a socio-historical interweaving of past and future. In this future, which therefore becomes part of the Ego constitutionally, at least as long as we live in a state of authenticity, there cannot fail to be the knowledge of the always immanent possibility of our own death.

for non-totalising and partial identities. Within feminist SF, the contradictory identities embodied by the cyborg provide a means of questioning existing definitions of gendered subjectivity. As Haraway suggests, 'The cyborgs popu- lating feminist science fiction make very problematic the statuses of man or woman, human, artefact, member of a race, individual identity, or body' (Haraway, 1985: 97). The ambiguous postmodern romances of feminist SF are transgressive because they foreground female desire while evading closure around the binarisms of masculinity and femininity. The ironic 'cyborg mon- sters' (Haraway, 1985: 99) who inhabit these narratives move between and across the subject positions of masculinity and femininity and allow the relationship between identity and desire to be explored outside the confines of fixed subject positions. The cyborg can be regarded as a di…

In the chap- ter “Love’s proper exercice: Eros and the dance”, I use drama as primary cultural material to assess the polarization of ideas of Eros such as they are reflected in the social practices of dancing. Likewise, I rely heavily on iconographic material in the section “The Ambivalent Lute”, to emphasize the contribution of the iconography of the lute to the definitions of Eros. I also envisage literature under the angle of literary analysis, especially in Part 2, which explores the contribution of the relationship of Eros and music to the poetics of the lute ayre, madrigal, and English epyllion. Indeed, my second aim in writing this book is to propose a theoretical frame for the culturally patterned uses of the relationship between E…

The repetitions here, which would be clumsy in the narrator’s discourse, are the reflex of the character’s desperation as she clings to the decision she finds she has made. The second moment of decision is also more physical than it is mental. Eveline is again immobile, again torn between alternatives. This time the painfulness of the dilemma compels her into prayer, as she wrestles with the question of her double, contradictory duties. But at the final moment, when the bell clangs (‘upon her heart’ – another Joycean masterstroke of economic phrasing) and Frank urges her to accompany him, Eveline feels that she is drowning, drawn by her lover into ‘all the seas of the world’, and her paraly- sis is like that of ‘a helpless animal’.

In this chapter I will explain one of the most fundamental processes of the subject in process: what Kristeva calls abjection, the state of abjecting or rejecting what is other to oneself – and thereby creating borders of an always tenuous “I.” As I described it in the last chapter, the imaginary/semiotic realm is seen as a necessary precondition for symbolic, linguistic articulation. This is one side of the dialectic that Kristeva marks out between the semiotic and the symbolic. But there is also, in Kristeva’s work, the negative side, where the semiotic or imaginary realm seems to threaten to disrupt the orderly symbolic realm. Again, we saw this in Revolution in Poetic Language. And it is a theme that continues throughout her work. It ﬁgures most prominently in her later book, Powers of Horror, originally published in 1980. Powers of Horror takes the reader back to the brink of how s…

beyond the false choice between collective action and individual pleasures, we attempt to circumvent the moral schemas that position love either as a supreme metaphysical virtue or as a weak panacea for the ills of capitalist societies. “[It’s] the binary of normative/transgressive that’s unsustain- able”, writes Maggie Nelson, “along with the demand that anyone live a life that’s all one thing”.4 We begin by addressing love as a social problem within critical theory. On one hand, love reproduces the existing social order by consolidating and naturalising our attachments to the status quo, and this has been a concern for feminist commentaries on sexual politics. As Kate Millett famously argued in 1970, “romantic love affords a means of emotional manipulation which the male is free to exploit … [and] obscures the reali- ties of female status and the burden of economic dependency”.5 On the other hand, love also belongs to what Michael Warner calls an “antino-

says, ‘It is not adequate to simply dismiss the category of nature outright, to completely retranscribe it without residue into the cultural: this in itself is the monist, or logocentric, gesture par excellence.’ The dialectic has to be strategi- cally preserved: ‘In the face of social constructionism, the body’s tangibility, its matter, its (quasi) nature may be invoked; but in opposition to essentialism, biologism, and naturalism, it is the body as cultural product that must be stressed’ (1994: 21, 23–4). Grosz’s language here emerges out of political debates about sexuality and gender in the mid–1980s. Crudely put, an essentialist position would suggest that, say, a woman is more nurturing and inclined to peace than a man because of her female nature; a social constructionist would say that she had learnt these values historically through her positioning, for example, in family and labour market. The urgency of the political debates of that period

Introduction Aristide Bianchi and Leonid Kharlamov On February 25, 2003, the day following the announcement of Maurice Blanchot’s death, Philippe Lacoue- Labarthe spoke on a radio program over the telephone: If there ever was a “break [coupure]” in Blanchot’s trajectory—I don’t like the term, but if there was a transformation, perhaps from the publication of Death Sentence onward (I say “perhaps,” as this is a hypothesis), then it is the moment Blanchot became posthumous. With the understanding, that is, that death is the condition of possibility of life, that he was thus already dead, that in a sense he had an experience without experience—an experience of death that would forever remain impossible and to which, on several occasions I think, he drew relatively near. In particular, I have in mind Blanchot’s two great texts written during those last few years, which in my view are his two great autobiographi-

is not worth what we thought’, it is no less valuable for that. Rather than being a residue of nihilism, this world appears as the fi nal measure, the ultimate value, to which all values, even the new values of the Dionysian destroyer– creators, are subordinate. Nothing can excel the value of the real world, and to imagine so is but an ‘aberration of human vanity’. However, in this very same aphorism, Nietzsche goes on to unpick the idea that man as the judge of the world – namely world negation – is only negative. In a dramatic about- turn, Nietzsche fi rst builds up the pose of ‘man against the world’ as a piece of ‘monstrous stupidity’ that ‘has fi nally dawned on us and we are sick of it; we laugh as soon as we encounter the juxtaposition of “man and world”, separated by the sublime presumptuousness of the little word “and”!’ But then there is a pause for thought:

Ponty’s later work we find this phenomenological position extended in the direction of an ontology. It turns out that our perceptual engagement with the world discloses a deeper truth. Human being is the sensible world returned to itself. We are Being’s achievement of self-awareness or self-congruence. Painting is an aspect of this. We must view it as part of a teleology of Being in so far as it expresses a ‘total visibility’, that is, as it brings us to see both the thing and the ‘invisible’ flesh or visual scaffolding which enable it to be seen. These relations entail, in other words, that, through painting, we who are visible in effect see ourselves seeing the visible. The sensible, thereby, is returned to itself. III I shall now offer a critical review of Merleau-Ponty’s theory of painting. First, whether or not we accept all the claims embodied in his early phenomenology or late ideological ontology, Merleau-Ponty is, I think, right to ascribe philosophical

To quote more extensively from Lorde, “the principal horror of any system which defines the good in terms of proﬁt rather than in terms of human need, or which defines human need to the exclusion of the psychic and emotional components of that need—the principal horror of such a system is that it robs our work of its erotic value, its erotic power and life appeal.”100 In this way, the erotic is suggestive of a life energy of refusal and revolt, a critique of systems of oppression that strive to make one’s labor, love, or time utilizable for the gain of others, thereby sapping one’s erotic life ener- gies. In this sense as well, the erotic becomes about more than fighting erotic injustice, drawing on Gayle Rubin’s phrasing, it is also about developing erotic agency—the power to define, redefine, name, and assert in the face of social and discursive struct…

One might object that it is possible to conceive of a practice that we might want to call "psychological" that would not have such effects, even in our society. Foucault's genealogy of the modem soul provides no proof against this possibility, nor is it designed to. What Discipline and Punish traces are not possible psychological practices, but actual ones. Foucault seeks to show the relationships of power within which our current practices are immersed.

Lack in Deleuze and Guattari’s refiguration becomes an effect of desire, rather than an origin (1983 [1972], 27). The shift they make in emphasising lack in the subject rather than in desire have important bearings on feminist revisions of desire, as will be discussed. In Deleuze and Guattari’s rethinking, desire moves along deterritori- alized lines. Their model of desire does not rely on lack to structure and motivate desire as does a psychoanalytical interpretation. As Rosi Braidotti argues: ‘In their appeal to a more positive theory of desire, Deleuze and Guattari argue that the idea of desire as lack reflects the specific his- toricity and the socio-economic conditions of a moment of capitalist

Consequently, it is men, rather than women, who throughout the novel act as her guides and supports. The pattern begins with her father, who takes an unusually attentive part in her upbringing, and it continues throughout her life. Towards the novel's end, when Martin re-enters her life, he is shown winning their dog's affection. The dog 'discerning in the man a more perfect thing, a more entirely fulfilling companion' (Hall, 82: 425). For all its bathos, there is an element of truth conveyed.

(12–13) Of particular interest when considering Lovecraft’s writings are Kristeva’s theories concerning the concomitant attraction of the abject. Kristeva suggests that the process of abjection entails a degree of jouissance that entices the individual, sometimes against their better judgment. “One thus understands why so many victims of the abject are its fascinated victims—if not its willing and submissive ones” (9).

has not remained the same. In the Western tradition, love is not inherently moral, in fact it does violate the demands of morality bestowed upon society by faith or by ethical attitude. Love has no rules. It has been an act of recognition, an unconditional commitment to the cause of intimacy, procreation, and sexual gratiﬁcation. More often than not, it has been an act of desperation. Desire dies when it is fulﬁlled, love, on the other hand, is never fulﬁlled. Thus, Éléonore de Lespinasse ends one of her letters with a dramatic line: “I love you as one should love, to excess, to madness, with transport and despair” (106). Modernity is dressed, or disguised with gender equality, pluralism, tolerance, liberty of conscience, and inalienable rights. Indeed, modernity has also opened the Pandora’s box of possibilities. The universe has been unlocked and we have lost the gods. Consequently, things are tragic not because they are ruled by pitiless gods and

in the project that consumed the last part of his career and which remained incomplete at the time of his death in 1940. The direct link between this project and the style of presentation Benjamin described in the introduc- tion to The Origin of the German Tragic Drama is expressed by Benjamin in this last project in the following words: “The book on the baroque ex- posed the seventeenth century to the light of the present day. Here, something analogous must be done for the nineteenth century, but with greater distinct- ness” (Arcades, 459; n1a, 2). A greater distinctness is made apparent by the fragmentary state of this work. More than any of Benjamin’s other works, the Arcades Project poses the question of how to read Benjamin. Indeed, what does one do when faced with a mass of quotations interspersed with a commentary presented in a fragmentary form identical to the quotations that ma…

whose work is antithetical to hermeneutic modes of thought. Hermeneutic film scholarship, as Deleuze highlights in his texts Cinema 1: The Movement-Image (2005) and Cinema 2: The Time-Image (2013), predominantly conceptualizes cinema in terms of movement-images, linear, abstracted, cause and effect models of time and narrative structure. Although there are different types of interconnected movement-images which are explored in more detail later, the most prominent of these, the large form action-image, conceptualizes cinema as beginning with a situation which creates forces directly leading to actions from characters, which in turn reconstitute the situation or the encompassing milieu. Through such a linear conceptualization of film it is easy for scholars to derive singular, unifying languages, meanings or semiotics from them as all other possibilities or potentialities of na…

Space, Time and Perversion marks a ground-breaking moment in the debate surrounding bodies and “body politics”. Elizabeth Grosz both celebrates and resituates the body in the space between feminism and philosophy, feminism and cultural analysis, feminism and critical thought. Exploring architecture, philosophy and, in a controversial way, queer theory, Elizabeth Grosz shows how these knowledges have stripped bodies of their specificity, their corporeality, and the vestigial traces of their production as bodies. She investigates the work of Michel Foucault, Teresa de Lauretis, Gilles Deleuze, Judith Butler and Alphonso Lingis, examining the ways in which the functioning of bodies transforms understandings of space and time, knowledge and desire. Elizabeth Grosz is Professor of Critical and Cultural Theory and teaches feminist theory, French philosophy and literary theory at Monash University. She is the author of Volatile Bodies (winner of

gained in importance. He drew nearer to Louis, so to speak. Slowly he began to hold his own with the older boy. You can observe in this account how the ego-model becomes an ego-ideal, how an example held up before the admiring boy becomes a love-object adored from the distance. Louis, a boy of flesh and blood, becomes almost a super-boy. The creation of the figure of William, who is a heightened double of the daydreamer, marks the desire to be near the worshiped object. The diffident boy does not yet imagine that he himself could visit this superior being; he is too shy to try that out, even in phantasy. His fancy creates a better substitute of himself, so to speak, an improved ego. In this remodeled form he dares imagine himself the pal of the revered Louis. William becomes more important, is even accorded a place near the hero of the daydreamer. It is clear that the love for Louis has …

granted. The loss of that reification of gender relations ought not to be lamented as the failure of a feminist political theory, but, rather, affirmed as the promise of the possibility of complex and generative subject- positions as well as coalitional strategies that neither presuppose nor fix their constitutive subjects in their place. The fixity of gender identification, its presumed cultural invariance, its status as an interior and hidden cause may well serve the goals of the feminist project to establish a transhistorical commonality between us, but the “us” who gets joined through such a narration is a construction built upon the denial of a decidedly more complex cultural identity— or non- identity, as the case may be. The psychological language which purports to describe the interior fixity of our identities as men or women works to enforce a certain coherence and to foreclose convergences of gender

Opposed to it is what he calls the ideology of technolibera- tion, a mixture of sociobiology, anarchism and biotechnology that promises to deliver humanity from the clutches of irrational fears and self-destructive desires. One of the followers of this scientifi c religion explains that metaphysical and historical angst is a mere disease of the immature mind: For a year or so . . . I really believed it: Here I am, staring into the abyss with Nietzsche. Here I am, on the brink of insanity, entropy, meaninglessness, the Enlightenment’s unspeakable godless rational damnation. One wrong step, and I’ll go spiraling down . . . But I didn’t go spiraling down. Because there is no abyss. There is no yawning chasm waiting to swallow us up, when we learn that there is no god, that We’re animals like any other animal, that the universe has no purpose, that our souls are made of the same stuff as water and sand . . .

of allowing human artefacts to be counted as mind-independent because all that they require is that at one point in time minds existed, which were the architects of the object. Nevertheless, minds do not need to continual- ly exist for those same artefacts to persist. However, this modal analysis of mind-independence still rules out being a realist about minds and mental states because trivially minds cannot exist in some possible world where there are no minds! At most, the modal analysis of mind-indepen- dence can serve as a sufficient condition for realism but not a necessary one. A satisfactory account of the condition of mind-independence thus needs to be weaker than the modal analysis in order to allow for the possibility about being a realist about minds. A realist about mental states or conscious experiences is one who holds that our world is a world containing creatures who are …

Introduction 13 The self is not autonomous, then, but subjected to, and arising from within, a process, and Lacan insists that through it we are ultimately disempowered. As Bowie (1993: 25) explains: The mirror-image is a mirage of the “I” and promises that the individual’s latent powers of coordination will eventually be realized; indeed it has a role in triggering the development of these. So far, so good. But the “alienating destination” of the “I” is such that the individual is permanently in discord with himself: the “I” is tirelessly intent upon freezing a subjective process that cannot be frozen, introducing stagnation into the mobile field of human desire. The promise of the mirror never fades as long as there is consciousness that is deceived into misrecognizing it. It gives hope that powers lay dormant within the subject that will at last be realized (“if only this ti…

unites subject and object. In fact, perception, in Merleau-Ponty’s view, is only possible because we are beings that have bodies, that we are embodied – not in a relation akin to piloting a corporeal ship (as descartes famously described it) but as an inseparable and indistinguishable unity of consciousness and body. Thus the eye (as an extension of the body) does not merely see what is presented before it but is itself a mobile part of what is presented (continually changing its position) and thus affected by what is seen. The eye moves – both within its socket and in respect to the entire organism’s ongoing motor activity – its ‘reach’ constituting a mobile ﬁeld of interaction in which attentive point of view is directed yet ever-shifting. This visual ﬁeld, made up of what the eye sees at any given moment in time, is a complex and ongoing construction. It consists of elements, linked to the observer’s own presence as part of the scene, that move forwards or backwards, in

ening quality. Thacker’s main point remains, however, that reality was not made for us, it has not been designed with a special view to human needs, but simply is what it is irrespective of our cultural projections and scientific models. The emergence of human beings is to be considered as contingent a phenomenon in the deep time history of the cosmos as the emergence of dust, heavy molecules, algae, oxygen and whale song. This conviction that the cosmos is indifferent towards human concerns and that human beings do not, in principle, have good chances for ration- ally mastering the environmental conditions for their potential thriving is also called “cosmic pessimism”, and Thacker understands Lovecraft to be the seminal author of this position (Thacker 2011: 80): “The view of Cosmic Pessimism is a strange mysticism of the world-without-us, a hermeticism of the abyss, a noumen…

Stockton / Bodies and God 135 'God' between Their Lips: In Search of Symbolic Holes Women Can Feel Here-on the question of perceivable concealments that only mysti- cal formulas can capture-is the link to the deconstructive feminist Irigaray. For the sake of making different (female) bodies appear, Irigaray renders these bodies opaque but seeks to lavish upon them concealments that they might wear. More striking yet, in offering us her version of spiritual materialism, Irigaray puts 'God' between women's lips. By means of this puzzle I want to make bold that with all that has been written in reference to Irigaray, we have not fully realized the interest of her materialist dilemmas (for my purposes, her theories in Speculum of the Other Woman and This Sex Which is Not One). They are, I suggest, more engaging, more nuanced, and even much different than they have been represented to be. Irigaray has been called an essentialist, for example,

Butler wants us to stretch our frames of perception so that we are able to see everyone as a face, Žižek and Badiou want us to look past the face for the sake of justice. To some extent, this clash is artificially orchestrated by Žižek, who overlooks the fact that Levinas clearly distinguishes between ethics and justice, specifying that while ethics relates to the face, justice must dissociate itself from the idiosyncrasies of the face in order to arbitrate between the claims of different faces. But what most interests me is that, despite their obvious disagreements, both positions seem to be on a quest for a universal foundation for ethics. After all, whether

It seems likely that a similarly deflationary approach will prove profitable for understanding the sense of agency. Chapter 9 provides support for that thesis, particularly in the suggestion that agency provides a common thread between our sense of ownership for our own bodies and body parts (what I called φ-ownership) and our sense of ownership for our thoughts (ψ-ownership). Turning from our awareness of our own agency to analyzing what that agency consists in, chapter 10 explores the relation between intentional action and commonsense psychology. It points to a range of phenomena suggesting, first, that there are ways of thinking about the springs of inten­ tional action that do not involve the propositional attitudes, and, second, that we can navigate the social world and coordinate with other agents without engaging the explanatory framework of commonsense psychol­ ogy.

This patriarch from outer space, wearing a crown of interlaced snakes and a purple cape, orders her rudely about, but nevertheless helps her overcome her submis- sion to the male rule on earth. Miss Algrave's repressions are magically lifted, she finds pleasure and profit in prostitution, and even plans, with vengeful glee, to become her boss's mistress. I would suggest that Lispector shows a similar glee in embracing the stereotypical simplicities and sensational bluntness of this very different narrative style, mocking for the moment her own more subtle and labored literary achievements. The parodic aspect of The Stations of the Body, then, cuts two ways: against sensational fiction, whose strategies Lispector uses and mocks, and …

These diverse approaches to thinking about the skin as a boundary-object, and as the site of exposure or connectedness, invite the reader to consider how the borders between bodies are unstable and how such borders are already crossed by diﬀerences that refuse to be contained on the ‘inside’ or the ‘outside’ of bodies. Thinking bodies Our title clearly references Jane Gallop’s book Thinking Through the Body (1988), which represents one of the many important feminist contributions to theorising embodiment.

so doing, Irigaray challenges the psychoanalytic claim of ‘anatomy as an irrefutable criterion of truth’ (1985b, 70–71) and offers an image to replace the lack assigned to women in psychoanalytic readings. However, in order to posit this alternative image she draws attention to the importance of the genitals in desire and sexual difference. Offering ‘two lips’ instead of a lack does not necessarily refigure the importance psychoanalysis gives to the operation of the genitals; it just replaces one image with another. The fact that psychoanalytic theory sees lack and Irigaray’s second look finds plurality still means that the genitals are determining women’s relation to desire. In other words, Irigaray does not suggest that psychoanalysis is mistaken or ‘wrong’; rather she implies that they have missed what is there. Oedipus also motivates Cixous’s critique of myths, in ‘Sorties’; although she does not directly deal with the Oedipal myth, she does deal with the

Maurice Merleau-Ponty ( 1908- 1961) FRENCH ♦ Merleau-Ponty has too often been viewed in the shadow of Sartre, as the younger classmate, as the “other” founder of Les Temps Modernes, as the “other” French existential phenomenol- ogist and Marxist. In his phenomenological work, Merleau- Ponty far surpasses Sartre in his knowledge and development of Husserl’s theory of perception. His early Structure of Behavior is an important attempt to argue against the pervasive Cartesian model of man as consciousness + machine-body. His important Phenomenology o f Perception is the most ambitious attempt to correct certain persistent problems in Husserl’s theory of per­ ception. It begins with Husserl’s basic techniques of phenome­ nology, provides an insightful account of the role of “sensation” in phenomenology and psychology, then quickly moves to Husserl’s later works, adding a thorough …

But at precisely the same time, it was also in­ stalling disciplinary regimes in all major social institutions: in the anny bar­ racks, in the schools, in the hospitals, and in the prisons. These disciplinary systems, revealed for the first time by Foucault' s genealogy, make a mockery of the Enlightenment' s claims to have created a utopia based upon fonnal political rights. As with sexual power, the creation of a certain kind of subjectivity is essen­ tial to the development of disciplinary power: "the individual is no doubt the fictitious atom of an ' ideological' representation of society; but he is also a real­ ity fabricated by this specific technology of power than I have called ' discipline .

brutal attack on visual, olfactory, and auditory modes of perception, a vile synesthesia of the repellent and obscene. Moreover, we are slowly made aware that the corpse is in a state of perpetual motion; maggots are pouring like a viscous liquid across the ragged remains of the body, falling and rising like a series of waves. The poet is struck by the sheer beauty of this rhythmic movement as it mimics the music of running water and the sound of the wind. Even as he conjures up the horror of death jerked back to life, of ﬂesh uncannily animated by the worms that are consuming it, he wrenches us into an awareness of the remarkable symmetries that thrive in the midst of putrefaction. Yet this aestheticizing gaze does not annul the horror of what is being evoked but accentuates it; the rotting carcass is both like, yet utterly unlike, the blossoming ﬂower to which it is compared.

as a sign of collapse or dissolution rather than a marker of disjunction. Nor does she parse gender and sex and sexuality, although she will argue for their conceptual and methodological separateness a decade later in “Thinking Sex” (1984). The work of Judith Butler (1956– ) has a singular place in this genealogy. Butler completed her PhD in philosophy at Yale University in 1984, where she worked with phenomenologist Maurice Natanson, and has spent most of her career to date in the Departments of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at the University of California at Berkeley. All of Butler’s work might be described as an exploration of the conditions of possibility of the subject, where the condition that has received Butler’s most sustained attention is gender. Butler rethinks gender by casting it as a performative, a doing rather than a being, and her theory of gender performativity can be read as a continuation of a tradition in twentieth-

address her theory in this light. In working with Foucault’s insights about sex in The History of Sexuality, Volume 1, Butler argues convincingly that sex, and not just gender, is socially constructed. Indeed, the heterosexual imperative of Western culture coerces sex in delimiting ways; thus, along with gender, sex itself is socially constrained and disciplined. I take this position to mean that the sex act is regulated in certain specific ways (any sex act falling outside of regulations is considered perverse), and the sex organs themselves put to use in closely regimented practices. Butler is clearly leading the challenge to claims that heterosexuality is “natural,” in terms of the (male/female) sex act as well as sexual preference. Fou- cauldian-theorized discipline exerts a huge force not only on constructing the subject, but also on what, in the very act of construction, necessarily ends up falling outside the subject: Thus, we also have abject bodies, “bod-

However, the new technologies that compress distance and reduce friction for capitalist enterprises also open up increasing possibilities for interaction between imagined communities or communities of interest. While these communities may be spatially distant, there are greater prospects than ever before of building coali- tions between them. As Rosi Braidotti (1994) reminds us, this new international politics of coalition raises key questions for feminist scholars in the ‘centre’, in the metropolises of the industrial West where migrant women constitute the bulk of what she terms ‘domes- tic foreigners’. ‘When’, Braidotti asks, will we accept that internationalization begins at home?

Introduction 11 Sustainability as a quantitative measure runs the risk of becoming effective and operational within the logic of advanced capitalism, which it aims to undermine, namely the liberal individual responsibility for one’s well being. . . . My response to this consists in adopting instead a non-unitary vision of nomadic subjectivity which, coupled with the idea of desire as plenitude and not as lack, produces a more transformative approach to ethical values. (Braidotti 2006g, p. 227) Hence, she says, the project is to give new content and urgency to sometimes-stifled values such as not-for-profit, collectivity or “the commons,” going viral or hacking, the link between theory and practice, and, last but not least, creativity. Whereas the research for Patterns of Dissonance had largely been completed in France, the book came out after Braidotti had moved to the Netherland…

all paradigms with which to draw attention to the traditional relations of gender and desire at work in cinema. Laura Mulvey’s canonical article – on the way in which the woman is constituted as spectacle for the male gaze in narrative cinema – makes mention of the qualities of fixity and one-dimensionality of the female icon, in contradistinction to the male protagonist on screen and the masculine spectator, who produce action and make meaning.17 Much has been written after Mulvey, suggesting the freeing-up of her positions of identificatory activity and passivity from notions of feminine/masculine, including works on queer spectatorship that focus on the potentiality of a series of ‘identifications which are multiple, contradictory, shifting, oscillating, inconsistent and fluid’.18 Maleness and femaleness, masculinity and femininity, offer pale shadows of the ideas of activ…

In Agamben’s case the question of animality is even more central to his theoretical work, as well as the object of one of his mono- graphs (The Open: Man and Animal (2004)). Starting with Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (1998), Agamben argued for the necessity of rethinking the binary oppositions into which Western metaphysics inevitably falls (and indeed metaphysics is nothing but the never-ending fall into these dualisms) – in particular, the dis- tinction between legal right/language on the one hand and ‘bare life’ on the other. The originality of Agamben’s thought consists precisely in its ability to show the myriad ways in which this dualism presents itself time and again. This dualism cannot be avoided, as it is constantly repeated by choosing one of its – inseparable and inter- dependent – poles. To choose the body, for example, as phenomenol- ogy sometimes seem…

The Other, he asserts, is ‘wholly Other’ [tout Autre], by nature, unknowable, inscrutable and incomprehensible, beyond the grasp and remit of both ontology (‘being’) and episte- mology (‘knowledge’), and perhaps even of philosophy itself. More than an object to be understood and rationally conceptualised, the Levinasian Other is absolutely ‘other to’ – in the sense of being radi- cally different from – the subject of conscious perception and always occupies in relation to the ego or ‘I’ a position of radical exteriority. For this reason alone, the Other is always more than the subject’s alter ego, the mirror-like replication of the narcissistic ‘me’ in the place of the ‘you’: ‘The Other as Other is not only an alter ego: the Other is what I myself am not. The Other is this, not because of the Other’s character, or physiognomy, or psychology, but because

feminist cultural studies of technoscience may also include the perspectives of non- human actors. Their inclusion is in line with studies in science and technology that have given much attention to the signiﬁcance of the activities of nonhuman actors in sociotechnical networks. Indeed, some feminist scholars in the ﬁeld of science and technology studies have radicalized theories of the position of nonhuman actors. Probably the most famous example of this radicalization is Haraway’s appropriation of the cyborg (Haraway 1991a, 1991b). As mentioned in the introduction to this volume, the term “cyborg” is an abbreviation of “cybernetic organism.” In a more popular vein, we may speak of technobodies: machine-humans, or machine-animals.

ated. At the same time, however, from a phenomenological perspective, those categories highlight distinct domains of experience, intelligibility, and social normativity. Contemporary critical phenomenology adopts an intersectional angle to describe the relation between corporeality, social experience, and social identity, relying on classical phenomeno- logical concepts and arguments to distinguish between the different social structures that operate at the levels of self- and other experience. To this end, as we show throughout the book, critical phenomenology draws on feminist philosophy, philosophy of race, phenomenological psycho- pathology, queer and disability studies, expanding and enriching the interdisciplinary character of phenomenological research. Due to the close and, we may say, genealogical continuity between classical and critical phenomenology, this introductory handbook intro- duces the field of critical phenomenology to readers who are not familiar

A technological feminist whose retheorization of the body parallels the most important scientific discoveries of the “biotech century,” Haraway strips the study of hybridity of its previous romantic af- filiations, inaugurating instead a creative vision of the body as a dynamic force field. Coded by the narratives of power yet remaining heterogeneous, local, and embodied, the body hybrid surfaces anew in a world of “co-texts” and “coupled structures.” A “problematic multiplicity,” the body hybrid can only know other “nonselves” by opening itself to new forms of reciprocal communication with all the hominids, animals, machines, aliens, zombies, and replicants of the future. In essence, if the body hybrid is not to be a copy of a master code, it must engage with the difficult heuristics of companion species. If there is no necessary immunity, there must definitely be (species) community. The Double Helix of Feminism

Preface The discipline of semiotics - or semiology - is now well established in Europe, or at least in the French and Italian university and intellectual systems. It has become much better known in the last decade in Anglo-Saxon countries - especially in film studies - although it is not always treated with the respect it has achieved on the Continent. Julia Kristeva's work, the subject of this book, derives much from the development of modern semiotics, even if it is also distanced from it to a certain extent. Although enough of an introductory nature has now been written on semiotics,1 a brief remark about its nature and scope are appropriate in order that we may better take our bearings in relation to Kristeva's work. Seminal texts explaining the nature of the discipline of semiotics, such as those of Barthes2 and Eco,3 apart from showing how it is dependent on a theory …

Two converging pressure systems provoke the transition from Cinema 1 ’s movement-images to Cinema 2 ’s time-images. One involves Deleuze’s view of how the medium stalls aesthetically.

By now, of course, one waxes suspicious ofsuch symptoms ofa privileged meta- physics of presence. Not that we can or should hope to avoid paradox, which indwells with language universally, but we may turn aside from the univocal "death is simply death" that smacks of the notion that a signifier can attach itself to a single signified. We should look farther into the language of the paradox, even if paradox then remains. In the textuality of"death may die," we may say that there is a "subject-death" and a "predicate-death."

More to the point, such a description of po- etry comes remarkably close to Blanchot’s articulation of what he calls the worklessness [désoeuvrement] of the work or art. For Blanchot, this means that the work of art refuses assimilation into the world of cause and effect, means and ends, and remains other with respect to the pro- ductive logic of labor and discourse. This sense of the work as an unset- tling overture asks to be read in at least three overlapping senses: (1) as an introductory but unﬁnished sketch in which a work ﬁrst appears; (2) as an opening marking the fascinating threshold of the in-between; and (3) as an obligation issued on behalf of what remains for thinking. In other words, Blanchot is attempting to mediate between the well- known fragmentary work of the romantic…

he is arguing, for instance, that "foolish subjects like those of The Magic Flute and Der Freischutz have more truth content through the medium of the music than does the Ring, which gravely aims at the ult,imate," he warns that "the ridiculous, as a barbaric residuum of something alien to form, misfires in art if art fails to reflect and shape it. If it remains.on the level of the childish and is taken for such, it merges with the calculated fun of the culture industry" (AT, 119). Adorno's warine~s about the aes- thetic misuse of ridiculousness mirrors his reservations about a nonre- flective privileging of the ugly, which, while allowing art a unique way of denouncing "the world that creates and reproduces the ugly in its own image," leaves the possibility "that sympathy with the degraded will re- verse into concurrence with degradation" (AT, 49). Or, as he puts it even more t…

being-is "inaccessible" in that it represents an indefinitely postponed fulfillment; this unattainability is essential to the tension of the metaxy. To assert otherwise is to indulge in the self-defeating perfectionism that marks, as we have seen, the gnostic attempt to go "beyond," to transcend the human situation. The novel is replete with mystical cults and with individual eccentrics whose attempts to do just that are indeed treated sardonically by Pynchon. The formidable Blicero, who is not so treated, is nonetheless shown participating-as we shall see-in an enterprise of gnostic transcendence that directly parodies Orphic naturalism. But none of this suggests that Pynchon does not valorize the process of "transfor- mation" by which humanity is able to achieve a deeper, fuller communion with Earth, or that the moments of mystical insight or identification ex- perienced by Lyle Bland, Slothrop, and others that we shall examine leave

which the human simultaneously forms itself (its feelings, sensations, thinking) in its forming of this outside. Through his critique of the history of Einfühlung, Bevan alternately characterizes empathic encounters as affective encounters between singularities, composites, and heterogeneous entities conceived within a flat ontology of turbulent materiality. In our next chapter, Nancy D. Nisbet draws the work of Alain Badiou and Malabou together to argue for an ontological plasticity of genetics and the possibility of evental mutation. Through her development of plasticity, Malabou opens up both the possibility of evental change in living beings and the establishment of a material form of absence through her analysis of destructive plasticity. It is

nating against the experiences and realities of some. Moreover, as Judith Butler demonstrates in “Gender Trouble, Feminist Theory, and Psychoan- alytic Discourse,” the dangers are not only that of shutting out the experi- ences of women not white, Western, middle-class and of the late twentieth century, but of constructing notions of self-identity which are implicitly heterosexist. A central thesis of Judith Butler’s essay is that gender identity is a regulative ideal which fundamentally assists the norm of heterosexuality. Psychoanalytic theory, in its diverse forms, including object relations theory and Lacanian and post-Lacanian theory, aids this regulative pro- cess. Such theory both “confers a false sense of legitimacy and universality to a culturally specific, and, in some contexts, culturally oppressive, version of gender identity” and contributes to the heterosexual ideal by intertwining gender identity and sexual orientation:

Chapter 2 56 which is reasoned within discourse and yet unlived (the Kantian antimo- nies)” (112). Rather than to favor a binary concept of life, Thacker names the strange affinity between the thinking of the world as unthinkable and the living of a life that is unlivable. Thacker thereby curates a concept of the horror of “a life-after-life,” a nouminous life that “elicits a noumenal horror that is the horror of a life that indifferently lives on” (112). Recall- ing this discussion by Thacker, Ligotti’s notion of “beings born undead” comes to mind and is suggestive of a life that indifferently lives on: “We are aberrations—beings born undead, neither one thing or another, or two things at once . . . uncanny things that have nothing to do with the rest of creation, horrors that poison the world by sowing our madness everywhere we go, glutting daylight and darkness with incorporeal ob- sc…

As already noted, other possibilities of poem transformations discussed by Arnheim include a move toward increased abstraction or concreteness in the presentation of reality. In addition, he sug- gests the possibility of tracing the growth and transformation of metaphors with the help of manuscripts. He also presents the case for a study systematically directed toward a poem's acoustic level, where alterations often—in connection with vocal harmonies, rhythmic effects, and rhyme—are extremely central. Arnheim's schema also gives prominence to the study of material that has been rejected as superfluous during the course of writing the poem and, conversely, of the new elements that have gradually been in- tegrated into the final totality. More than twenty-five years have passed since the appearance of Poets at Work, with Arnheim's essay. The intensive research that one might have expected on the extensive material systematically

images - vegetation, rock, sky, sunbeams - that play upon the surface of the water. There is an indistinctness about the self which exists in time. However, this indistinctness is conceded at one narrative level only to be retrieved at another. For if the man in the boat - the poet looking back - is figured as a kind of enchanted but 'perplexed' presence in the scene, there is another version of the poet - the poet as narrator - also present: he beholds himself recollecting, and as he does so he brings under control the very complexities that confound his experientially embroiled self. This control however is no reductive thing. Rather, it is a matter of according the experience of a 'perplexed' immersion in time a fullness - a sense almost of plenitude - whilst, simultaneously, bringing that experience under the syntactical control of a de- tached narrative point of view whi…

muck of patriarchal oppression. This erotic project was rooted in the belief that women can form worlds and worldviews apart from patriarchy and gen- der oppression. In the words of Lorde, the erotic surfaces “as an assertion of the lifeforce of women; . . . [the] use of which we are now reclaiming in our language, our history, our dancing, our loving, our work, our lives.”104 Under feminist separatism, each part of life was utilized toward seeking an antisex- ist erotic—from shelter making and building communities to activist work and political organizing. These erotics were grounded in a critical approach to sexism and heterosexuality as well as in the thrill of organizing with other women, or in Lorde’s words, “the power which comes from sharing deeply any pursuit with another person” and in “examin[ing] the ways in which [the] world can be truly different.”105 Separatism had…

"The Locus for the Other" 9 The elements of "The Laugh of the Medusa" that prove most trou- bling from a Bakhtinian perspective all reflect a look inward, an endless return to the self. This is neither surprising nor necessarily lamentable. The project of women's writing is a retrieval of feminine identity: it is, therefore, a project of self-knowledge, se/^-awareness, and self-expres- sion. The need to establish feminine identity through women's writing ac- counts in part for Cixous's references to autoeroticism, narcissism, ho- mosexuality, and —the predominant and most problematic of images — the womb. All of these imply relationships that are directed more toward self and sameness than toward the "alien word." All are related, as Cix- ous evokes them, to the private inner voice of desire. "Break out of the circles," she urges women; "don't remain within psychoanalytic closure" (263). Yet Cixous's incessant return to the libido, to the body and its re-

M. suggests, the hippocampus is the site of long-term memory and consequently a sense of self that is con- stant through time. (The relationship between a sense of self and an awareness of remembered spacial location—the “highly developed spatial memory system” of primates Emery and Amaral describe [2000, 170]—is fascinating and provocative.) The phenomenology of constancy in time—that one thing follows another and that these events can be grasped together as a meaningful whole—emphasizes the anticipatory nature of memory and its relation to the vastly dif- ferent automatic anticipatory nature of “classical conditioning” that Kandel has studied at length. In these observations, I argue that pain exists as an episodic or explicit memory—it is something that “happens” to a person—and it

Her work is primarily a content analysis, that is, she examines various depictions of female characters which it is difficult for females to read easily unless they adopt the position of a male reader. She states: ‘To read the canon of what is currently considered classic American literature is perforce to identify as male’ (ibid.: xii). She suggests, and Elaine Showalter’s work in this area would seem to reinforce her point, that it is standard reading practice for women students at university studying literature to position themselves as male in order to make sense of the text (Showalter 1971).6 Fetterley states: ‘While women obviously cannot rewrite literary works so that they become ours by virtue of reflecting our reality, we can accurately name the realit…

Introduction 4 emergence of our collective being engenders a new, horizontal percep- tual experience in which our prior concepts “about” the world dissolve, replaced by the actual life-world itself. We suddenly experience ourselves as actually existing, the world fills out like a great balloon of horizontal presence and mutuality, and the spiritual radiance that had previously been contained through collective social withdrawal suddenly becomes visible, illuminated. Not to idealize the experience—we have a long way to go still before we can endure this enlivening and enlightening experience of social transformation without internal and social conflict because our very safety as social beings appears (from our fear-saturated condition- ing) to be as much at stake as our physical bodies are in the presence of a wild animal—but the experience is nevertheless fundamental in its gra…

33 Living flesh argue that The Phenomenology of Perception falls within the metaphysics of presence or a belief in the possibility of coincidence between consciousness and being, with The Visible and the Invisible ‘it is even harder to say’.8 Far from being a matter for judgement, the problematic linkage between language and embodiment which is opened up between the two philosophers – between phenomenology’s bodily text and deconstruction’s texual body – is an immensely provocative one. Merleau-Ponty relates meaning to corporeality in the form of gesture – bodily expression – a gesturing towards an always unfinished articulation of a world. While itself unprepared to acknowledge the existence of perception,9 deconstruction’s reference to phenomena owes a debt to Merleau-Ponty’s break with the concept of perception as a natural coincidence of consciousness and things. On the other hand,…

The work of Julia Kristeva leads us back, however, from a male-dominated symbolic to the mother, and to areas of her dominion and influence which have, Kristeva argues, been underestimated in (male) accounts of the construction and mainten- ance of human personality. Kristeva is best known for her concept of the semiotic, which she mobilises as a means of locating and inserting 'the feminine' back into the exdusively masculine post- Oedipal world described by Lacan. Kristeva fully accepts Lacan's account of the symbolic order by means of which sodal, sexual and linguistic relations are regulated by/in the name of the father. She suggests, however, that the symbolic is oppressive because it is exdusively masculine - that is, because it is limited, not just because it is limiting (in terms of the actual sodal and sexual

Commending the evidentiary quality of Atget’s photos of empty Parisian streets, Benjamin clearly favours the use of the new technologies for their evocation of ‘hidden political significance’ as opposed to their affinity for the anthropomorphic and its sentimental valences. In these respects, Benjamin’s Artwork essay reveals the influence of Bertolt Brecht, whose own writings and theatrical technique would similarly assert the primacy of political materialism over the emotional manipulation of the era’s bourgeois theatre. With ‘defamiliarisation’ or making strange (verfremden) posited as the principal aesthetic imperative of this radicalised, didactic art, ‘empathy’ with characters is considered

1 Introduction ROBIN TRUTH GOODMAN KEYWORD: FEMINIST THEORY This book comes at a time of major transition and radical change in the way gender is publicly recognized and organized, from debates worldwide over transsexuality and gay marriage as well as regressions in abortion and birth control policy, to austerity measures, sweatshop labor, war, environmental policies, and migration policies that cause misery disproportionately to women, and new arrangements of labor that substitute robotics for bodies and service for manufacturing. In light of these transformations, it is impossible to consider feminism as having produced a settled body of theory. Especially in the language it uses to describe itself, feminism must be presented in active development. When we initially started to work on this volume, feminism was a word becoming rarefied in popular culture and sometimes in academi…

By granting them writing or symbol-​making, Toby allows the Crakers the tools that will enable them to deal with their own ecological crisis as it arises, leav­ ing the reader to speculate on how they will do that, and whether they will follow in the footsteps of their creator or be able to forge a new way of living. Toby gives the Crakers more than writing. She gives them an “origin story,” almost in opposition to Haraway’s cyborg who “has no origin story in the West­ ern sense” (Reader 9). Haraway…

In this sense, Blanchot’s words about Foucault are all the more pertinent: “In bearing witness to a work demanding study (unprejudiced reading) rather than praise, I believe I am being faithful, however awkwardly, to the intellectual friendship that his death, so painful for me, today allows me to declare to him” (Blan- chot 1987, 109). I believe that this statement by Blanchot more than any other helps explain Derrida’s attitude in his homage of careful yet distant intellec- tual respect toward Deleuze, especially given the detailed reading that Derrida gives to this passage by Blanchot in Politics of Friendship. A second answer comes from Deleuze himself, in his provocative reflection on “friendship” in L’Abécédaire to which I referred in part 1, that is, the asser- tion that each of us is apt to seize upon a certain type of charm in another, or

in its reach because it depends on a realm of subject and object positions, i.e., a constituted (meaningful) world, it nevertheless remains an essential horizon of what Kristeva calls "the signifying process." Kristeva turns to psychoanalysis to deepen the phenom- enological account and credits it for theorizing meaning's constitu- tive conditions, i.e., semiotic processes of meaning production.4 Kristeva thus inherits an account of the symbolic from Husserl and of the semiotic from Freud. The concern in this chapter is not to present an exhaustive analy- sis of the project of Revolution and Poetic Language, but rather to introduce some of the basic terms, dynamics, and modes of analysis characteristic of the formative years of Kristeva's development. The first section, "The Semiotic and the Symbolic," provides a general description of Kristeva's theory of language and the roles that phe- nomenology and psychoanalysis play in it. The second section,

by virtue of social processes and cultural norms rather than a natural unfolding of a biological process that determines sex. In this frame, gender does its work by exposing both the conditions of possibility and the material effects of sex. Insisting on their conceptual distinctness secures the critical edge of gender, and helps denaturalize the binary of sex, whose “constitutive ambiguity” can be covered over or lost by a distinction that would understand gender as cultural and sex as natural, or gender as a behavioral role and sex as a material fact.17 However, that critical edge can also be dissipated to the extent that gender retains its conceptual distinctness, particularly its difference from sexuality. Butler has advanced both of these positions in “Against Proper Objects,” claiming that if we are to understand “gender” to mean something other than simply “sex” and avail ourselves of its potential to disrupt binary notions of sexual difference that are commonly understood

Kantian, neo– Arendtian, and other humanist traditions that “see the recourse to the brain as the death of man.” Grove, dispensing with these enfeebled humanists and their attachment to a human (and humanity) who never existed anyway, attempts to push Malabou’s concept of de- structive plasticity to new limits. By situating Malabou’s work on neuronal plasticity alongside the work of cyberneticists and other writers, Grove explores how neuronal plasticity is at the heart of scientifi c and literary experimentation in- volving the brain and human systems. Taking up mid- twentieth- century concerns with control, security and the capacity for understanding and transforming the cognitive behavior of individuals and populations, Grove engages the po liti cal context and concerns of a generation of sci- entists. Ultimately, he argues that Malabou’s concept of destructive plas- ticity invites us to confront the “horrors” of po liti cal plasticity and that

to aspect change; the new can only be what was severed and what remains outside of any relation whatsoever. In short, Malabou’s image of the brain is an image of revolution, the success of which depends as much on for­ getting as it does on total rupture. And it would be hard to imagine how something like a revolution could be sustained on the basis of forgetting and an opposition to relationality. For this reason, it is also important to emphasize that this deconstructive vision of the brain’s function fails as deconstruction, precisely because it wants to locate the rhizomatic move­ ment of thought as an essential feature of the human brain, hence, the conceptual foreclosure of our capacity to imagine or constitute an out­ side. If we admit that much, then what we have is less a revolutionary conception of cognition than a normative statement about how we think, in a hardwired…

Image and memory depend upon each other. What is more, the loss of the former brings about the loss or falsification of the latter. Susan Sontag has this in mind when she argues that “[h]eartlessness and amnesia seem to go together.”64 For her, images of violence help humanity get over its sense of helplessness before catastrophe and regain trust in a positive treatment of reality. Through this lens, renouncing the terrible image as callous and heartless just because it portrays violence conduces to a grad-

All forms of thought are by this token, therefore, ﬁctions. No ultimate truth is ever discernible. The most famous of Barthes’ works is, undoubtedly, The Death of the Author (1968). In this essay, he rejects the view that an author is the originator of his text and the sole authority for its valid interpretation. A work in no way and on no level reﬂects an author’s intentions concerning the work. The author is nothing more than the location where a verbal event takes place.The reader can therefore approach the text from any direction what- soever, and can interpret the text (the ‘signiﬁer’) without DAVID CARTER 102

The Thought of the Outside in The Time-Image (Deleuze and Blanchot) Marie-Claire Ropars-Wuilleumier A Strange Attractor The grand narrative of the cinema that Deleuze proposes is, we know, ruled and turned on its head from the inside by the eternal return of sameness-in-difference (l’éternel retour du même différent). Many film- makers who we thought modern—such as Jean-Luc Godard and Pier Paolo Pasolini, as well Robert Bresson and Orson Welles—have a place in both of the work’s two volumes, reappearing not only in Cinema 2: The Time-Image, but also in Cinema 1: The Movement-Image, along- side those greats of the silent era, Buster Keaton, Jean Epstein, or F. W. Murnau. Thus the cinema plunges into itself, digging within itself its own time, more than it develops linearly. Nonetheless, volume 2, that Time-Image that preoccupies us today, sees the appearance of auteurs that are its exclusive domain: not only

The paradigm of this transformation is the experience of brain damage: “Whereas the psychoanalytic narrative of the resistance of the indestructible within destruction privileges the persistence of child- hood, the past, and psychic destiny, which become recognizable through the disturbance that solicits them, the neurological narrative of the destruction of the resistance to destruction stages the exhausted but surviving resources of a psyche that no longer recognizes itself . . .

of this for Badiou’s project is that mathematical formalization can only be, as it was for Lacan, an ideal. Yes, desire is an illusion premised on misrecognition; an empty, baseless surplus over being. And yes, as Badiou maintains, the real—being—is no doubt best conceived in thought as a pure, inaccessibly and inconsistently infinite multiplicity from which nothing is missing, in which nothing lacks. Yet for all the evidence of its duplicity and unreliability, the greatest illusion of all is the one that upholds the possibility of the psyche’s absolute dissipation. Though psychoanalysis certainly does not deny the possibility of the experience of being, for the speaking subject being in language, in consciousness, is always barred, unattainable, unsatisfying, elsewhere. Les non‑dupes errent, says Lacan, riffing on his name‑of‑the-father idea: those who are not duped (by the Other) err.4 Though Lacan in his later teaching fully embraces the project

In Levinas’s phenomenology of the advent of the ethical, the relation to the other is inescapably asymmetrical; ethics cannot be a matter of reciprocity, equilibrium, or equality based on sameness. Irigaray addresses Levinas’s thought in Ethics of Sexual Diff erence and in “Questions to Emmanuel Levinas.”31 She clearly adopts the language of abso- lute alterity from Levinas, but predictably locates the crucial sort of alterity in sexual diff erence. Notably, Levinas cannot be charged with entirely overlooking the question of relations between men and women in his ethical philosophy. For this philosophy includes a depiction of erotic relations that gives a role to “the feminine.” Irigaray and others, including Derrida, will critique this account of 28.

doing things? Insofar as they offer perspectives on the past, a first consideration is that, as I have already claimed, films of the movement-image tend to close down the past, while films of the time-image keep the past open. This distinction offers something of a simplification—Deleuze himself never made such a claim. Most films of both image regimes provide models of change, that is, of how one set of circumstances alters in some way such that a new set of circumstances comes into being. (Alternatively, a narrative might instead begin with a set of circumstances which is subsequently disrupted—typically called a narrative’s development or complication—such that narrative closure is achieved when the original set of circumstances is returned to.) If a new set of circumstances comes into being, then films of the movement- image will present these rather differently than wil…

On the one hand, Lorde was anything but asexual, as her journals, poetry, and biog- rapher Alexis De Veaux speak to her relishing of sex, sexual love, and sexual seduction in her friendship groups and feminist circles.90 Yet on the other hand, Lorde wrote and talked about erotics in a way that did not bind emo- tional depth and intimate relating to sex.91 This is nowhere more clear than in her essay “Uses of the Erotic,” which Lorde wrote four weeks before she found out she had breast cancer, in 1978, for the Fourth Berkshire Conference on the History of Wom…

Of considerable influence on this work are feminist, queer, and subal- tern theories of affect that emphasize it as a social, subjectivizing, but also collectivizing force. The work of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Lauren Berlant, Sara Ahmed, and Sianne Ngai is particularly useful for tracing the ways emotions have a social and political force that escapes conventional analy- ses of individual psyches and personal experiences. Affect in their work is that which both restricts and makes possible the notions of personal, col- lective, and emergent identities. For these theorists, affect is a deeply rela- tional force that attaches itself to and is expressed through all kinds of cul- tural texts. Affect shapes the surface and very being of subjects and objects as they come into contact with each other. Affect is not inherently counter- discursive or progressive; often, shared feelings tend to reinforce individu-

Recent Hauntology Studies Ever since the 1990s and the publication of Derrida’s Specters of Marx, hauntology has haunted literary studies, and various aspects of ghosts within prose fiction have been scrutinised on different ontological levels. However, it is also useful to have a look at some more recent studies of hauntology in order to situate the coming chapters theoretically. Mark Fisher had an almost uncanny ability to diagnose the contemporary ideo­ logical situation. In Ghosts of My Life, he pursues a hauntology that he claims has saturated our time to such an extent that we hardly discern the phenomenon any longer. Since Fisher mainly traces hauntology in popular fiction, he probably has the ability to capture its most recent shape and the speed with which it moves, or perhaps more accurately, the speed with which it loses speed and almost gets stuck in a frenzy of rec…

He is also the first to show how the philosophical problems it presents are projections of social anxieties regarding taste. Everyone knows Benjamin’s essay. Its lament is contagious: Mechanical art, especially the photograph and the film image, removes from art the “aura” (1936, 222) that customarily surrounds it. Although “in principle a work of art has always been reproducible” (218) – the woodcut, the painting, and the lithograph are Benjamin’s sequential historical examples – photography and film complete this process, which results in a qualita- tive transformation in the nature of the art object: the “decay,” as Benjamin puts it, “of the aura” (222). The “aura” Benjamin defines as “the unique phenomenon of a distance, however close it may be, whether a mountain range on the horizon or a branch which casts its shadow over you” (222–3). Painting preserves the aura because…

cyberpunk science fiction authors have a strong interest in this new subj ectivity. Indeed, it is on this issue that the two genres merge in the most interesting ways. Postmodern theorist and science fiction critic Donna Haraway, for exam­ ple, is particularly interested in the human-machine hybrids known as cyborgs. "The cyborgs populating feminist science fiction," she writes, "make very prob­ lematic the statuses of man or woman, human, artifact, member of a race, indi­ vidual identity, or body."36 This is, of course, precisely what is so interesting about these bioelectronic syntheses: they challenge our preconceived ideas about human subjectivity in a radical way. Haraway is interested in the cyborg mainly from the point of view of postmodem feminism: "The cyborg is a kind of disas­ sembled and reassembled, postmodem collective and personal self. This is the self feminists mu…

ena of our experience cannot be reduced to ﬁxed essences; rather, in exis- tence they have provisional forms and structures and themes and thus are always open to new and other possibilities for both being and meaning. Thus, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, the philosopher whose focus on embodiment transformed transcendental (or constitutive) phenomenology into existen- tial phenomenology, tells us that “the greatest lesson of the [phenomeno- logical] reduction is the impossibility of a complete reduction.”2 Instead of seeking essences, then, a phenomenological approach seeks, in a given case, the meaning of experience as it is embodied and lived in context—meaning and value emerging in the synthesis of the experience’s subjective and objective aspects.3

experience nor its institutional forms.”6 Sex is understood as penis, vagina, testicles, estrogen, and they all have nothing to do with politics. Gender is, according to this account, “everything else,” that is, a system of social sig- nification and semiotic formation. Taking a different stand than Rubin, Judith Butler read Simone de Beau- voir’s axiom “one is not born a woman, but one becomes a woman” not as a call to alleviate the female reproductive function, but as a battle for gender. For Butler, gender is an identity that both precedes the self at birth and is gradually acquired. But for Butler, while sex is an invariant factual aspect of the body, what concerns feminism is the acculturation of that body. The distinction between sex and gender serves to attribute the value of the social functions of women to biological necessity, and to cease to refer credibly to gendered…

losophy: current feminist concerns can unearth dimensions in earlier texts – for example, the sexed connotations of their concepts – which have always been present but can be articulated and more explicit only in the context of subsequent feminist movements.17 Similarly, predom- inantly English-speaking feminist debates around nature, essentialism, and sexual diversity enable us to analyse critically the strengths and weak- nesses of Irigaray’s later philosophy and so, too, to ascertain how it can be resituated within a framework that recognises bodily multiplicity as well as duality. Complicating the question of the appropriate language for discussing Irigaray’s ideas is the untranslatability of some of her terms, conspicuously her distinction between masculin and f´eminin. She speaks of a f´eminin sex, desire, language, and cultural world (TS, 149/146, 30/29; DBT, 131), whereas English…

And perhaps too my own reticence at revealing these attachments from the outset has something to do with not wanting to be dismissed as anachronistic in this era of ‘‘post-poststructuralism’’: far better to be rescu- ing something or someone else. I too have an affective state to preserve it seems, one that positions me fully within rather than outside of these debates, saturated with epistemological–ontological tension. This tracking of affect as revealing of something brought to as well as revealed in the text is also central to the last chapter of this book, where I explore the limits of a Western feminist fantasy of its own progress through a focus on affective excess. In this second experiment I intervene in dominant political gram- mars of Western feminism by starting from stasis or explosion as a failure of

Entangled Fidelities: Reassembling the Human 57 is determined in advance or open to reliable prediction, but it does show that if our behaviour is to change then appeals to the purely rational dimension of ourselves are going to be more limited than we care to recognize.6 I will now support this with reference to more overtly philosophical sources. In analysing how decisions come to be made and positions adopted, one factor that needs to be taken into account is how much most of us take on trust. In part this is a matter of necessity in that the details of many matters of concern or issues are so complex and potentially overwhelming that we are more inclined to address them by asking first whose interpretations are to be trusted than by examining the details ourselves. This makes good sense as there is often neither the time nor the capacity to enter into such issues at the required depth. Environmental concerns

As the camera focuses on Vera, her body holds still, as if time and move- ment had been frozen. To use Deleuze’s concept, we see the emergence of the ‘time-image’, which affects and transforms our perceptual and interpretive experience of the cinematic image, and thus opens onto other connections (Walsh 2004: 200). As Deleuze puts it: ‘The time-image does not imply the absence of movement (even though it often includes its increased scarcity) but it implies the reversal of the subordination; it is no longer time which is subordinate to movement; it is movement which subordinates itself to time’ (Deleuze 1989: 271). It is important to bear in mind that the ‘time-image’ is not only associated with the long take;…

Death is now a permanent, invisible yet watchful and closely watched presence in every human undertaking, deeply felt, twenty- four hours a day and seven days a week. The memory of death is an integral part of any of life’s functions. It is accorded high, perhaps the foremost authority whenever a choice is to be made in a life made of choices. Once the terrifying worry of ultimate, yet distant death had been split into day in, day out worry about spying out in time and ﬁ ghting back against (or better still warding off) the innu- merable and ubiquitous singular and close-at-hand causes of death, and as alarms about newly discovered but heretofore unknown pathogenic substances and regimes follow one another in rapid succession, every act and every setting of action, includ- ing acts and settings thus far believed to be innocuous and harmless or not thought of at all as ‘death relevant’, become suspected of causing irreparable harm and bearing terminal

words, the sort of spiritual entropy encouraged by the death-oriented Car- tel. The counterbalance is the drive toward the increasingly refined moral structures reflected by the transcendental ground. To revere and encourage nature's replications and renewals and to attune one's spirit to her pro- cesses is-in Pynchon's terms-to participate in that ground. It is pre- cisely through such participation that preterition, in the sense of the universal and inevitable mortality of the individual in nature's scheme, is sanctified into the election of the species and of Life as aggregate. The sophisticated doubling mechanism of Gravity's Rainbow can be seen at work once again here in its normative aspect, bringing to light the positive modalities of spirit that the assumption of an inspirited cosmos generates. The blurring of the distinction between the preterite and the elect in a natural communion parodies the gnostic slippage examined in

—and, perhaps most importantly, in the context of present currents in twenty-first-century Marxist philosophy. However, aspects of this work aim at a longer historical view and broader context, which can be seen for example in chapter 2 on Plato’s Symposium. But, in what ways will we think about love beyond what has already been said by philosophers from Plato to Fromm, bell hooks, Alain Badiou, and so many others who have produced a veritable library on love? There are four basic distinguishing features of the present study, and far more in the particularities. First, I bring together interdisciplinary sources on love that have never been synthesized in a single study. Such a synthesis will be contextualized and proven necessary for both appreciating and moving beyond the tendencies and deficits prominent in the literature’s history. Too many theories of love (indeed all of them) ignore…

Capital- ism, which has transformed art into merchandise and subsumed all areas of life and human interaction to the market, is based on the libidinal economy, which implies the production and permanent externalization of desire that never achieves pleasure or satisfaction. It is urgent to liberate desire from existential eroticism and the libidinal economy, allowing ourselves to enjoy differently than…

necessarily contingent and capable of being otherwise. As such, Badiou significantly broadens the possibility of our ability to think change within the social sphere, while also allowing us to maintain the best insights of structuralism through his account of consistent multiplicities. Badiou's meditations on the relationship between sets and subsets is thoroughly mereological in character. In making claims about the extensional composition of sets (parts), Badiou underlines the manner in which the parts of a set are simultaneously objects in their own right while also being parts of larger objects, to wit, the sets from which they are drawn. What is interesting here is that the parts are not defined by their relations to other elements in the set, but are objects of their own that can be detached from their membership in the set. Here object-oriented ontology and onticology f…

On the other hand, when Adolphe’s father decides to provoke the couple’s separation, the effect is the converse, and Adolphe ex- presses this explicitly: ‘“Supposing you are separating me from her, you may well be attaching me to her forever.” The tragic aspect of this situation derives from the fact that desire, in order to obey this particular logic, does not thereby cease to be desire: i.e., to cause the unhappiness of the one who cannot satisfy it. The second law of this universe, also an ethical one, will be for- mulated as follows by Constant: ‘‘The great question in life is the pain one causes, and the most ingenious metaphysics does not justify the man who has broken the heart …

feminists should incorporate the most inﬂuential biological theory of the nineteenth century—Darwin’s theory of evolution. Grosz identi- ﬁes aspects of Darwin’s thought that can be used to develop a feminist approach to biology. Her argument oﬀers a kind of template for how the “new” feminist critiques of science should operate. Nothing is out- of-bounds; all possibilities are considered. And most importantly, the materiality of the subject of science is paramount. The subject of Claire Colebrook’s essay is what she calls the “new vitalism.” Although she rejects the conservative vitalism of thinkers such as Bergson, Colebrook asserts that a radical feminist materialism must be grounded in a redeﬁned vitalism. Colebrook discusses the work of Elizabeth Grosz along with that of Marx, Hegel, Bergson, Material Feminisms

Rejecting familiar forms of bios in favor of an unknown zoë, he simulta- neously rejects mimesis as the primary function of poetry, claiming that “only the imagination is undeceived” by such linguistic replications of life. As Agamben argues, language is the primary technology that defines and produces “man,” the means by which man “separates and opposes himself to his own bare life.”57 Rather than replicating such anthropo- centric linguistic practices, the objectivist poems of Spring and All seek materially to connect “man” with excluded forms of bare life, to “recon- cile / the people and the sto…

say they are identical). This can help absolve Agamben from the repeated charges of extreme political pessimism that have marked his work. First of all, it is worth recognising that Agamben does not consider himself to be pessimistic at all, saying in an interview that ‘I don’t see myself as pessimistic ... I am sure you are more pessimistic than I am.’43 We may wonder if this statement was made in good faith, coming as it does from a philosopher who gained international notoriety with his assertion that the camp is the nomos of the modern.44 Here it is worth comparing Agamben to Adorno, who presents an apparently similar set of claims regarding the historical trajectory of modernity, and the potential for absolute domi­ nation that it contains (a potential unleashed in the twentieth-century totalitarian states). Adorno is infamous for his political pessimism, which reaches an almost lyrical height in his late book Minima Moralia. To pick out a striking passage:

problems with his analysis. I conclude with a call for fat activists to use Bataille and his work to develop an analysis of death and generosity as part of fat politics. Fat, Excess, and the Project of Dieting Bataille’s work oﬀ ers fat scholars and activists ways to resignify fat’s excesses. In his three-volume work Th e Accursed Share, Bataille takes on questions of economy, religion, and eroticism. In his view, the central problem of hu- man economy is not scarcity, as posed by classical liberal economic theory, but abundance. Energy is abundant in the world, life is proﬂ igate in its eﬀ usion, and wealth is marked by its excess. Th e sun is Bataille’s exem- plar of this exuberance, throwing oﬀ energy with no sense of purpose and no need for return. “Th e sun,” he writes, “gives without ever receiving.” Social systems, once they have used the energy they need to grow, must address the issue of excess. “If the excess cannot be completely absorbed

Derrida, likewise, in Archive Fever, returns explicitly to his own earlier attempt, in his 1967 “Freud and the Scene of Writing,” to read Freud’s Project, and to link it to Freud’s later work. It is on the level of the formation of psychoanalytic concepts, then, in the way that Freud’s concepts inscribe a memory, archive their own his- tory within themselves, that psychoanalytic discourse will bear witness to the history that psychoanalysis encounters. This is how, I believe, we can interpret Derrida’s insight about the Freudian concept: The principle of the internal division of the Freudian gesture, and thus of the Freudian concept of the archive, is that at the moment when psychoanal…

walter benjamin 43 Benjamin sees a wide number of ramifications of this basic change. I will only mention two, closely related to the questions of modern experience already raised. The first is that the function of the image changes, from being predominantly a material vessel of a unique spiritual presence (“aura”) to being largely a discursive vehicle for information and ideologies. The repeated, ritual contexts in which the traditional artwork appeared also made images important means of maintaining traditional ways of thinking and feeling; modern images, by contrast, more strongly emphasize novelty – new, exciting, surprising contents and feelings. Hence, in terms of the Erfahrung / Erlebnis distinction discussed earlier, we might say that the traditional, “auratic” work of art is bound to an order of experience strongly characterized by Erfahrung, the experience of repeated traditional actions and speech; whereas in contrast

which has informed disciplines from political theory to postcolonial studies.' 2 Perhaps nowhere have the problematic implications of certain scopic regimes been as rigor- ously probed as in the area of gender, where the notion of the objectifying "male gaze" emerged only a few years ago in the work of critics like Laura Mulvey, Griselda Pollock, and Mary Ann Doane as one of the primary mechanisms by which oppressive patriarchal relations seemed to be maintained. It is a mark of the rapid and proliferating discussion of visuality that these relatively recent efforts now seem somewhat dated as more complicated and nuanced notions of gendered spectatorship have been advanced. If anything is clear about the vigorous and ongoing discussion of how to situate "sexuality in the field of vision," to borrow the title of Jacqueline Rose's influen- tial book," it is that we are still very much at the dawn of a collective exploration that shows no signs of reaching an easy consensus.

Herzogenrath argues, neither Deleuze’s movement-image nor his time- image completely sufficiently grasps: here, time and matter produce their own filmic image. In recent research in philosophy and in the humanities, there is a strong tendency toward questions of matter and materiality, from “Object-oriented Ontology” through “Agential Realism” and “Material Culture.” Lorenz EngeU’s article looks for a link between these approaches on the one hand, and the aspect of media, and the mediatic, on the other. One surprising parallel can be found in Pier Paolo PasoUni’s approach to film theory in his essay on “The written language of reahty,” originally presented in 1966 and sharply rejected by then influential semiological theories. Re-read today, as the article suggests in detail, not only Pasolini evokes the broad materialist tradition of the medium of film and its theory and aesthetics, but he can also add

‘theological’ (Seamon 1997: 324)—the idea that the work of art presents us with a surface, an appearance, and that the critic's job is to reveal the real pattern, the ordered structure, or the dominant ideology that exists beneath that surface. Whether the critic follows the techniques of New Criticism or the methodologies of psychoanalytic or poststructuralist readings, the common assumption is that the critic's role is to tell us the truth about the text. These sorts of interpretative practices are the ones that Arthur C. Danto calls ‘deep’, and the sort that Susan Sontag, in her famous essay ‘Against Interpretation’, wishes to have done away with. When philosophy of art employs such interpretative practices, it presupposes that the artwork manifests the appropriate degree of depth and complexity, not to mention intricacy of design and intention, to mark it as worth critical investigation. In a word, for philosophy of art, the artwork that admits of

Most admira- bly, Beauvoir presents the postmenopausal woman as a solid person, rather than the ghost of a woman that popular culture tends to portray. There remain elements of Beauvoir’s reﬂections on women’s bodily ex- perience and its implications for freedom that are open to criticism. For example, her reﬂections on menstruation vacillate between arguing that the sense of discomfort and devaluation that many women experience about menstruation has its source entirely in social relations, on the one hand, and claiming that women’s nature as reproducers chains them to species being in a way to which we must simply resign ourselves. The thoroughness of her treatment of these experiences, which she describes

than a "projection" of another character, and he is based on an actual, historical, figure. The effect on the reader is as if Dick has said, "All right, Horselover Fat was funny, a Falstaffian comic figure based on some of my own tendencies; but these tendencies also exist even more markedly in respected people in the real world, and the consequences of such behavior-such madness-are very serious indeed: they can kill you." Thus this realist portrait of a man obsessed with metaphysics is the final and complete repudiation of these interests when they are taken to' an extreme, as they are by Timothy Archer, and by Horselover Fat, and, by direct implication, by an important part of Philip K. Dick himself. As Dick is presenting us an opposition in this trilogy between the visionary and the realist, we should expect to find characters in this novel that illustrate and advocate th…

present times, Turingzeit (Kittler, 2006, 2009). His latter works put in place a new set of concepts that promise a new understanding of culture (2009: 26–28): stocking, processing and transmission. Only when a medium successfully assembles them (the computer) is it possible to trigger a system of thought which, retroactively, understands the way these functions were assembled and set apart throughout history and its material culture. The method is clear: by analyzing a culture’s objects, we are able to understand its world view and power structure. If Kittler starts his Gramophon, Film, Typewriter by stating that “Media define our situation, which (despite of or because of it) deserves a description,” he clarifies the meaning of this despite of or because of it: if we are indeed determined by media, there is no “outsider” point of view from which we could engage in a neutral analysis.

That is the responsibility for my neighbor, which is, no doubt, the harsh name for what we call love of one’s neighbor; love without Eros, charity, love in which the ethical aspect dominates the passionate aspect, love without con- cupiscence. (Levinas 1998b: 103) Furthermore, while Levinas understands the ethical relation as a rela- tion between the self and one other person he also acknowledges and dis- cusses situations involving more than two individuals. This political relation is not secondary to the ethical relation but is already present within it as ‘[t]he third party looks at me in the eyes of the Other’ (Levinas 1969: 213). As soon as a third person enters the picture the absolute responsibility for the other becomes more complicated as I must then make judgements about the competing needs of the two, three or many others. This is now a question of politics and of justice for Levinas (Bernasconi 1991, 1999; and Critchley 1992). Nevertheless, even in this

We hope that the essays in this reader will provoke questions about how to better (and perhaps more systematically) approach thinking about the historical and material enmeshment of these categories. We also hope it will serve as a resource for folks to consider more concretely the racial implications of the operationalization of sex/gender/sexuality as objects of knowledge across the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. And finally, we hope that this reader will recenter the study of racial forma­ tions as a radically interdisciplinary project, not one that belongs strictly to “culture,” but one at the heart of the naturecultural world we hope to

To be sure—​and as the first two chapters develop in greater depth—​Derrida’s published and unpublished corpus, in addition to his par­ ticipation in films, contain noteworthy meditations on or about the medium that exist and converse with a host of his texts brushing up against cinema and its topoi, for instance, the visual arts, photography, television, and the teletechnological. Although these publications can be viewed to advance to­ ward or loom over cinema in a categorical manner, there is no denying that, for some, the subject irradiates as a sort of protracted blind spot or curious missing link within Derrida’s archive, acutely so if this determination relies on the “unambiguous” empirical t…

between a human subject and a non-human world within which the subject is embedded. The only diʃerence is that with moral pessimism, we have a subjective attitude about the worst of all possible worlds, and with metaphysical pessimism we have an objective claim about the worst of all possible worlds. But both views, being concerned with “the worst” (pessimus), implicitly rely on an anthropocentric view – either one is stuck with a bad attitude or one is stuck in a bad world. (As Sid Waterman once put it, “I see the glass half full, but full of poison.”) So, while Schopenhauer himself was a curmudgeon, and while he does state that this is the worst of all possible worlds, his philosophy ultimately moves towards a third type of pessimism, one that he never names but which we have tenuously christened a cosmic pessimism.191 For Schopenhauer, the logical endpoint of pessimism is to question …

which makes the subject (as, precisely, this symbolic, third place) into a linguistic signifier in a system, which thereby permits him to relate symbolically to other signifiers, that is, at once to relate to other humans and to articulate his own desire, his own uncon- scious, unawares. What, then, is Dick’s story in this conception? Initially, Dick has a separate relation (a relation of projection) to each of his imaginary objects. What Klein does is to articulate the relations of the objects among themselves, Dick being one of the objects in the system: Dick learns to assume himself as such, to assume himself as a signifier. “Dick—little train, Daddy—big train, Dick is going into mummy.” In saying this, Klein takes the relation between Dick and the train and articulates it as a relation between two trains. In this way she introduces Dick into the Symbolic through the con…

Introduction Iris van der Tuin and Bolette Blaagaard “What constitutes that rather singular field of intensity we call ‘Braidotti’s work’?” asks Judith Butler in this volume. “How to make an assemblage with Rosi Braidotti?” asks Gregg Lambert. And, indeed, part of the timeliness of this collection of engagements with the oeuvre of the European feminist philosopher put center stage here is generated by such questions—questions that innovatively bridge the gap between the thought produced and the thinker herself. Theories of embodiment such as Braidotti’s seem to require an inclusive methodology for interpretation that innovates on the hermeneutical tradition. In addition, this volume of critical and creative chapters on the lifework of Braidotti is timely simply because Braidotti’s generation of “Babyboomers” has been of great infrastructural importance in academia and beyond, wh…

No serious attempt at a Deleuzian approach to feminism and spectatorship can afford to ignore this important deployment of the philosopher’s work. Just as psychoanalytic feminist film theorists drew not only on the work of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan, but also on feminist philosophers and critics such as Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Juliett Mitchell and Jacqueline Rose, Deleuze and Film: A Feminist Introduc- tion draws on important feminist appropriations of Deleuze’s work by contem- porary feminist thinkers such as Elizabeth Grosz, Claire Colebrook, Dorothea Olkowski, Rosi Braidotti and, in particular, Moira Gatens, who have mobilized Deleuze’s work on difference and the body in o…

Levine, performs similar work to mediation for Jameson, opening a contact zone for literature and society, literature and life. Her conception of form enables her to introduce the idea that forms have affordances, certain tasks that, because of how they impose order, they accomplish. Neoliberal apocalypse resolves social contradictions, yes, and it also, in its encounter with social forms imposed by the long downturn that feel hopeless—like mass incarceration or networks of global ﬁnance or debt peonage—affords a sense of hope. The tragedy of neoliberal apocalypse is that the sense of hope it affords is betrayed by the long downturn, lending itself to the contemporary structure of feeling that Lauren Berlant calls “cruel optimism.”³² Literature, then, entails symbolic acts and the enactment of forms with certain affordances, and it is, also, a commodity vying for distinction within a lit…

pleasures. While love is on the one hand valorised it has also been dismissed as a delusion, a restriction of freedom, and a distraction from more urgent political agendas. Jean-Paul Sartre, for example, dismisses love as a form of escapism that avoids or distracts from the difﬁcult and painful reali- ties of life. For him it also involves an attempt to dominate the other and to limit her or his freedom and this inevitably ends in hatred and cruelty (Sartre 1995: 364–412). Following Freud, love is often perceived as delu- sional – it involves idealisation such that it is not the beloved who is adored but an ideal phantom. For Freud, all love is either narcissistic or anaclitic: it involves projections onto the other of either the self or of the founding love experienced with either the mother or father. What is loved is not the other but the image of the self or parent imposed upon the other (Ferrell 1996: 47–55). Feminist theorists have also been wary of love,

machines they construct to explore it in ways that we cannot predict. Feminist theorists of the body want deﬁnitions of human corporeality that can account for how the discursive and the material interact in the constitution of bodies. They explore the question of nonhuman and post-human nature and its relationship to the human. One of the cen- tral topics in this approach is the question of agency, particularly the agency of bodies and natures. Material feminists explore the interac- tion of culture, history, discourse, technology, biology, and the “envi- ronment,” without privileging any one of these elements. Material feminism opens up new ethical and political vistas as well. Redeﬁning the human and nonhuman has ethical implications: dis- courses have material consequences that require ethical responses. Eth- ics must be centered not only on those discourses but on the materia…

Her migration from the machin- ic assemblages of “The Cyborg Manifesto” to the “dogs, people, and significant otherness” who populate The Companion Species Manifesto is very much feminist theory. Similar to her theoretical predilection for mapping opposing binaries—representation ver- sus simulation; universal philosophies versus ethnophilosophies; organism versus biotic component—“The Cyborg Manifesto” and The Companion Species Manifesto represent a thought-machine for unconcealing, and thus overcoming, the binaries in her own feminist theory.

metaphysical elements of duration, via the special usage of light, spatial and temporal overlay and other techniques. My ﬁnal chapter concerns duration and the time-image of the horror ﬁlm. The cinematic image moves across time in a complex trajectory. The apparatus of cinema manipulates and melds past, present and future, shaping our awareness of the properties of time and modulating our experience of it. The inﬂuence of Bergson on Deleuze’s ﬁlm philos- ophy is crucial here. For Deleuze, time is pivotal to cinema’s philosoph- ical resonance. Film is an event of temporal process and duration. This operates across both the textual diegesis and the spectator fused in its assemblage. The temporal movements of horror ﬁlm are fractured and non-linear. The past impregnates the present in a haunting which seeks to block the ﬂow of present into future. The past threatens to dominate the present and also to shape the future in its own replicated image which brings stasis.

argues that the key for this to happen lies in the recognition that our current way of amorous relationship is dominated by subject–object relationships and that a shift towards subject–subject relationships is necessary. She proposes to change from ‘I love you’ as the ‘you’ in this expression is an object of my desire to ‘I love to you’. This entails, according to Irigaray, a recognition of the ‘twoness’ of a relationship. By recognising this, it is possible to love a subject while respecting their ‘otherness’ instead of reducing them to an appendix of oneself. What’s left to enquire is whether such a technical change in language can overcome mate- rial, symbolic and other inequalities in relationships. A similar position can be seen in bell hooks’ All about Love (2000) in which hooks proposes that we ought to understand love as a verb, rather than a noun. She suggests that by understan…

or less than our capacity to re-affirm or to destabilize it. The many arguments around Butler’s work (arguments which engage with the trajectory of her work from Gender Trouble to more recent work on state violence) have been the subject of various volumes but here what is impor- tant is to note, as this volume will demonstrate, the range of Butler’s influence. At the same time, both Butler and Beauvoir raise questions for feminist theory that are less about the explanatory authority and vitality of their work and more about the issues presented to feminist theory by writers whose very discipline poses problems about the relationship of theory to practice. Those problems are explicit in the work of both writers: the Simone de Beauvoir who wrote The Second Sex would not, at the time of the book’s publication in 1949, have regarded herself as a feminist, in the same way Butler resists the term ‘feminist’ when associated only with women because of

These points enable me to complete my outline of Merleau-Ponty’s later philosophy. As we have seen, for him our seeing of a visible object presupposes a dimension of ‘invisibility’ constituted by relevant details of our body’s present, possible, and past orientations towards the phenomenal field—orientations of which we are not immediately aware. These orientations are themselves only made possible in so far as we know that we—as beings who see—are ourselves visible. Our pre-reflective awareness of this fact, in other words, provides a kind

saliva, sweat, tears and putrefying flesh. In terms of Kristeva’s notion of the border, when we say such-​and-​such a horror film ‘made me sick’ or ‘scared the shit out of me’, we are actually foregrounding that specific horror film as a ‘work of abjection’ or ‘abjection at work’ –​ almost in a literal sense. Viewing the horror film signifies a desire not only for perverse pleasure (confronting sickening, horrific images/​being filled with terror/​desire for the undifferentiated) but also a desire, once having been filled with perversity, taken pleasure in perversity, to throw up, throw out, eject the abject (from the safety of the spectator’s seat). In Kristeva’s view, woman is specifically related to polluting objects which fall into two categories: excremental

Freudian response to Malabou’s incisive critique of psychoanalysis in The New Wounded: From Neurosis to Brain Damage. In his piece, Cristóbal Durán explores Malabou’s contribution to the development of contemporary materialism with respect to her reelaboration of the notion of form and its relationship to subjectivity, affect, and temporality. Durán first highlights the way that Malabou rescues form from its mid-century, poststructural critique by rearticulating it as possessing its own immanent capacity for transformation: whereas spirit and matter, or, in Malabou’s recent language, the symbolic and the biological, are traditionally bifurcated in metaphysics, and the former term in the binary is seen as necessary for externally animating the latter, Malabou stipulates that form does not require any exterior or transcendental resources, but is capable of supporting and enacting its own self-differentiation, self-transformation, and metamorphosis. In this way, the life of form

Once more Guyon sees them from without, while he had plunged them into that water in which the bathers of Bern, to refer to Casanova, perceived nude young maidens who were there for their service. All this puts us in mind of the gardens of Armida, or even that picture of the creation of the world which Hesiod paints for us, and where we see Venus rising from the waves, still covered with a veil offoam. Then, says the poet, all the scattered move- ments impressed upon the universe by love directed themselves toward her. But the same image can make itself more subtle and refine even further the metamorphoses of which the nude is capable. Thus Hein- 3 Faerie Queene, II, xii, 77.

He writes, ‘The way in which the other presents himself, exceeding the idea of the other in me, we here name face. This mode does not consist in ﬁguring as a theme under my gaze, in spreading itself forth as a set of qualities forming an image. The face of the Other at each moment destroys and overﬂows the plastic image it leaves me . . . It does not manifest itself by these qualities . . . It expresses itself.’36 Clearly, Levinas is not concerned with the image of the other, but rather how the other exceeds that image, and thereby exceeds the subject’s knowledge of it. Similarly, and to return to an earlier point, phenomenological interpretation does not attempt to explain the meaning of an image or representation, but to exami…

Death will wipe away all there is to see in the landscape about one, in the ir­ reversible extinction of one’s individual existence. One sees the indeterminate and interminable abyss, nothingness itself. One feels it ready to gape open under every path that looks unstable, under every tool in one’s hand that one senses may malfunction or break up. What feels this imminence of the abyss is the anxiety that throbs in the very core of what one is. Yet as death closes in, courage can arise from some unknown depth of oneself. Courage is a force that can hold one resolute and lucid as death itself approaches. Courage and trust have this in common: they are not at­ titudes with regard to images and representa…

key theorists render their object in these same elusive ways. When Julia Kristeva, in her essay Powers of Horror (1982), explains her concept of “abjection” (one of the central terms in horror’s critical lexicon), she admits that “the twisted braid of affects and thoughts” that abjection elicits does not actually have, “properly speaking, a deﬁnable object” – it is, she says, “a ‘something’ that I do not recognize as a thing” (1–2). To put it in the aphoristic words of Gertrude Stein: There is no there there. And this is what Eugene Thacker, in In the Dust of This Planet (2011), seizes on in his account of horror and our “unthinkable” world: that horror is “a privileged site in which [the] paradoxical thought of the unthinkable takes place” (2). As critics of horror – or just as readers and watchers – we might not be able to escape the notion that part of horror’s fundamental effect is the simultan- eous invitation and refusal of our desire to interpret.

function. Modern poetry wants to create new connotations beyond the semiology of language, while the myths are founded on a semiological naturalization of the meaning of objects. Poetry aims to overcome the factual and mythical system of meaning through modernist writing as a semiological system against naturalization by the myth. However, the best weapon against the myth is the artiﬁcial myth as it is constructed by the great writers, for example in Flaubert’s aesthetics where there is a play between the semiotic and the real that creates a poetic reality different from the mythical reality. Barthes situates the analysis of the role of mythologies in modern, capitalist society as an important task of semiotic and structuralist analysis. The mythologies of the present capitalist society express the effort of the bourgeois class to naturalize their particular existence in society. The bourgeois class is the social class that will

14 FEMINISM AND FILM By the middle of the 1970s psychoanalytic theory grew generically distinct. Laura Mulvey's germinal essay 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema' (Mulvey 1975) describes a psychic context in which voyeurism, fetishism and narcissism all structure film viewing. Mulvey's essay is cited and reprinted (by myself among others), more often than any other film theory (Humm 1992). This is perhaps because Mulvey, in a hugely original gesture welds Althusserian theory, feminist aesthetics and feminist theory together with psychoanalysis. Since I discuss her writings in some detail below let me quickly here summarise her main themes and point to her impact. Mulvey's insight, derived from study of the relationship between film techniques, spectators and viewing pleasures, is that films deliber- ately create masculine structures of'looking'. It is 'the gaze', Mulvey argues, which is the main mechanism of filmic control. According to

DELEUZE’S CINEMA 13 there are a great many rewards in conceiving of “a little time in the pure state.” Time-as-movement and time-as-time can comfortably coexist. The Time-Image What then is a time-image? As I have already stated, time- images have a “looser” sense of time, a conception of time as lived or experienced rather than measured or specified on a clock or calendar. But I have also stated that cause-and-effect relations between the past and the present (and the future) are much weaker in films of the time-image than they are for the movement-image. For the time-image, the past does not necessarily cause the present (or the future), at least not in any direct or straightforward way. I have also claimed that what is important for films of the time-image is a notion that the past can change (or be changed). Deleuze can act very much as a guide here, for when writing of …

As Timothy Kaufman-Osborn ( 1997 ) highlights, in her effort to question essentialist and static notions of gendered identities Butler reverses the causal arrows, such that discourse unilaterally becomes the cause and gender the effect. It is not only the sexed/gendered subject that is deconstructed by Butler, but the subject as such. No more than sex and gender, she contends, do subjects exist apart from the continuous repetition of exclusionary discursive subject positions. Both sex and subjecthood are mutually independent phantasms, produced by means of the suppression of potentialities that are unintelligible within current discursive regimes (1990/1999, 1993).

A certain distance will eventually return with the second interchapter—the book is not a paint- ing, this is not a pipe—yet the distance between writer and medium, character and reader, has effectively vanished. The Body Artist also integrates another, more recent medium into this dy- namic: the Internet. In her grief after Rey’s suicide, Lauren begins impulsively to watch a live web camera that broadcasts images from a Finnish highway. It replaces her prior relationship to newspapers, yet without the dialogue of community. It breeds solipsism rather than solace. The new medium engrosses her and she recedes into her grief.

cism is filled with discussions of the “Mirror Stage” every time someone walks past a mirror, but we do see this stage as a part of social and individual development often in children’s literature. Lacan’s other major concept is that of Lack. The Self is seen as always lack- ing something that, if it could only get that something, would make the Self complete. Since the Self is constituted by being separate from the Other, this Lack can never be filled. In Edgar Allan Poe’s The Purloined Letter, no one ever learns what is in the letter; it is the letter itself, or rather, its Lack, that drives the entire plot. If we go back to Saussurean terms, the sign made up of the signifier and the signified, we can interpret the letter as a signifier without, for most of the story, any sig- nified attached to it. Therefore, people can pour into that empty signifier all manner of interpretations. What is in the letter is what other people Lack and thus want to find in it.

Therefore, it should not be regarded as a passive con- duit for mental activities and contents but rather as an agent that plays an indispensable role in the genesis and expression of thoughts, feelings and hence memories. Whereas con- ceptual thinking and its representations tend to marginalize the corporeal dimension of existence in favor of abstract schemata, the body’s symbolic function grounds meaning in the concrete realm of matter. Memory is inseparable from technology. Since prehistory, being human has meant being involved in the development of technologies, not only mechanisms and tools, but also stories, pictures and melodies.

They work to dramatize—as indeed any well-used “stage” should—the experience of alienation and separation in the subject’s acquisition of language over and against a false duality and gestalt self-aggrandizement. Where human development gets narrativized as progress and continually increasing mastery (of motor coordination, of speech, of understanding), as a story of learning, it is experienced, accord- ing to Lacan, with more frustration as a series of halting and fitful gestures. The difficulty with this process comes from what Lacan calls the “generic prematurity of birth” and the “specular capture” that it provokes (“Subver- sion of the Subject” 686). The child’s dependence on others for its survival places it in a divided position where it sees something other …

tions. The demand for a unified position in the relation to the gender “woman” is a product of a power regime, and is not a straightforward pursuit of justice. This brings to light the disintegration of a humanist hope and creates a disturbance in a whole political and institutional practice, threatening its ongoing viability. That the feminist cause has suffered in terms of membership is perhaps a proof of this. Butler argues that it makes no sense to assert the specificity of woman as a stand-alone object, outside other axes of power. She signals a skepticism as to whether the object of feminism preexists its analysis. This is a difficult claim for feminism to accept; the politico-theoretical problem whether there is such a thing as “woman” before feminism invents it. But at the same time, Butler seeks to propose something of which feminism could be the discourse, which would allow one to be feminist and continue to work out feminist theory and action, and to

The move in recent works has been toward larger cultural issues, a move often attempted through reassessments of the concept of negative theology. Différance and Negative Theology As has often been discussed, Derrida’s shifting terminology resem- bles the God of negative theology.5 Any important term, whether trace, différance, or God, is “neither a concept nor even a name; it does not lend itself to a series of names, but calls for another syntax and exceeds even the order and the structure of predicative discourse.

Although Holmes seems to be on the verge of rejecting much of what Scarry says in The Body in Pain, she is instead inspired to reread the book. She finds things there she had overlooked, such as an acknowledgment that chronic pain is distinct from the acute pain of torture. “Perhaps the fault is not in The Body in Pain,” Holmes suggests, “but in how we have tended to read it”: “Drawn to the keen lines of acute pain and the attractions of the unmaking of the world, we have bypassed the places in the text where the world …

American Traditions: Nineteenth-Century Women Writers, ed. Joyce Warren (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1993), 15. We should hear the echo of Walter Benjamin in Warren’s words. It was Benjamin’s spirit which provided much of the critical energy for this critique of formalism. The well-known ﬁnal words of “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” clearly identify “apo- litical” aestheticism with fascism: “[H umanity’s] self-alienation has reached such a degree that it can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic pleasure of the ﬁrst order. This is the situation of politics which Fascism is rendering aesthetic. Com- munism responds by politicizing art” (Walter Benjamin, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” in Illuminations, trans. H arry Zohn [New York: Schocken, 1968], 242). Today, Benjamin’s insight—that there is no purely aesthetic r…

Sexual passion becomes almost a weapon against each other and a scourge to themselves. Sex becomes the site of the world's pressures upon them. It is social rejection that turns them to the company of their lesbian friends, Mary seemed frantically eager to proclaim her allegiances to Pat's miserable army. Deprived of the social intercourse which to her would have been both natural and welcome, she now strove to stand up to a hostile world by proving that she could get on without it. (Hall, 82: 384) This is very slanted. By referring to it as 'Pat's army', we are focused onto the least positive of all the women - Pat who: 'Collected her moths and her beetles, and when fate …

Course: Ink, general linguistics ‘I had just read Saussure.’ These words appear in the second preface to Mythologies, which Barthes added in 1970 to reflect upon the original time and tenor of the book: This book has a double theoretical framework: on the one hand, an ideological critique bearing on the language of so-­called mass culture; on the other, a first attempt to analyse semiologically the mechanics of this language.

the state. His interpretations insist that the laws of kinship give way to the laws of the state; they also presuppose the separability of kinship and the state. And it is on this issue that Butler’s revision of Hegel is crucial to her own attempt at constructing a version of Antigone that represents alter- native models of kinship. She writes: For two questions that the play poses are whether there can be kinship – and by kinship I do not mean the ‘family’ in any speciﬁc form – without the support and mediation of the state, and whether there can be the state without the family as its support and mediation. And further, when kinship comes to pose a threat to state authority and the state sets itself in a violent struggle against kinship, can these very terms sustain their independence from one another? This becomes a textual problem of some importance as Antigone emerges in her criminal…

of the body' as 'a stylised repetition of acts' (ibid., pp. 136/140, original emphasis). This position goes beyond the traditional sex/gender dichotomy in placing both concepts in the domain of discourse, more precisely as two facets of the same regulatory discourse of binary sexual difference. In Bodies That Matter (1993) Butler reworks the concept of gender perfor- mativity as citationality. While Gender Trouble posits performativity as inten­ tional, though involved in power relations which cannot be transcended but only redeployed, Butler's later formulations restrict the agency of the subject even further. Citationality 'consists in the reiterating of norms which precede, constrain, and exceed the performer' (ibid., p. 234). Thus, we do not act or articulate our assigned sex through discourse, but the discourse of sex - i.e. the law of binary heterosexuality - acts and articulates itself through us.

The aim will not be to return to the polemic and reductive anti-utopian critiques of Cioran and Gray or to argue for either one to be superior, more truthful or philosophically more accurate or rig­ orous than the other. Rather, I want to trace the seemingly counterintui­ tive dialectic of utopianism and pessimism. The central question is what could be productive about engaging with what Eugene Thacker has called the “nightside of thought”?8 As Thacker has put it,

And sometimes, beauti- fully, the works do fall right back into this abyss, and we should not want to stop them. In fact, we should perhaps hasten their withdrawal into one’s own personal archive of errant thoughts and writings. If they did not do so, then we would have forgotten that “Th e pure potentiality of thought is a potentiality that is capable of not thinking, that is capable of not passing into actuality.”7 Th e impulse to delve into one’s potential, and to work with the infi nitely undefi ned mass of possibilities that are there, has, of course, its practical implications: the “fi nished” product is not only never fi nished— I would go so far as to wager that it has less intrinsic value in and of itself for the person who created it than we might eve…

they are always penetrated intertextually by other impulses that deprive them of their putative disinterested, autonomous status. (Jay 1994: 516) For Derrida, therefore, it was in the polluting margins of visual texts that ambi- guity was located, and where deconstruction took place. For Barthes, ambiguity in visual representation was more alluring. In Camera Lucida he confessed to an intense investment in the visual promise of the photograph. Ambiguity was implicated in this promise. As he said, ‘I felt, by the strength of my “invest- ments”, their disorder, their caprice, their enigma, that Photography is an uncertain art, as would be (were one to establish such a thing) a science of desirable or detestable bodies’ (Barthes 1988: 18).

was especially noteworthy for its elevation of ethics to first philosophy: our infinite responsibility to the Other as the primordial condition for any philosophizing. The antipodes of Levinas and Nietzsche, the mutual exclusivity of ethics and aesthetics, of responsibility to the Other and self- creation, polarized the discussion of ethics in French philosophy to a great extent. Thus, while Derrida devotes a substantial and well-known essay to Levinas in 1964, “Violence and Metaphysics,” he is quite critical, taking issue with Levinas’s reading of Heidegger in Totality and Infinity and noting that Levinas’s “ethics” is not an ethics per se but rather an “ethics of ethics.”59

theme is developed in Totem and Taboo, where Freud traces the birth of civilization to the moment when primitive men rise up against the dominant male of their group, kill him and eat him. By forging bonds of guilt, remembrance and repentance, this primal act of revolt transforms a world that happens to be male-dominated into a society that is properly patriarchal.23 If this ‘totemic fable’, as Kristeva characterizes it, figures murder as the inaugural gesture of civilization, elsewhere in her writings crime is represented as an altogether more corrosive force. In Powers of Horror, for example, Kristeva declares that ‘Any crime, because it draws attention to the fragility of the law, is abject’.24 The ‘abject’, for Kristeva, is made up of those vilely fascinating objects of disgust and fear that populate the hinterlands of the psyche. It repre- sents material that is emphatically banishe…

as a source of collective strength rather than an obstacle to overcome. This echoes Audre Lorde’s (1984, 110) argument in “The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master’s House,” that differences among women are not to be feared or ignored, and if solidarity is based only on what all women have in common, then women of color will only continue to be marginalized and excluded from mainstream feminist analyses and actions. My hope is that the account of feminist allyship masculinity to be articu­ lated in the rest of this book does justice to Lorde’s insight. One notable feature of my approach here is that while I underline the importance of difference, I do not follow many sociologists and men’s studies scholars who draw a bright line between allies and other members of social move­ ments. Daniel Myers for example differentiates between beneficiaries and allies, where the former are “rank-and-file activists who hail from the pop­

of women’s and gender studies and feminist theory. As Martha Nussbaum states in a 1999 article, ‘Butler seems to many young scholars to deﬁ ne what feminism is now’ (1999: 38). Her seminal work Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity (1990/1999) shook the fundaments of feminist theory by its radical questioning not only of gender but of biological sex too. Ever since, her theory of sex and gender as discursively produced performative effects is widely repre- sented as the alternative to essentialist accounts of gender. As Hennessy states, the attention that Butler’s work has received ‘indicates that her ideas have struck a chord in a certain sector of the public imagination of new ways of knowing sexual identity’ (2000: 55). In the wake of Gender trouble Butler has sought to qualify many of her stand- points in order to repudiate what she sees as misinterpretations. Bodies that matter

She also indicates that if it is to exist at all, it must be produced by women who read, as she had read, the erotic writings of their ‘foremothers’, and who, whilst saluting the efforts of these authors, work to extend the discourses they evolved: Voyez vous, j’ai beaucoup aimé Colette, qui est un bon écrivain, qui est trés savante.

warrant a reading of the project to retrieve the subal- tern consciousness as the attempt to undo a massive historiographic metalepsis and ‘situated’ the effect of the subject as subaltern. I would read it, then, as a strategic use of positivist essentialism in a scrupu- lously visible political interest . . . This would allow them to use the critical force of antihumanism, in other words, even as they share its constitutive para- dox: that the essentializing moment, the object of their criticism, is irreducible. The strategy becomes most useful when ‘consciousness’ is being used in the narrow sense, as self-consciousness. (214) Spivak makes clear that strategic essentialism is not a ‘search for lost origins’ (1988: 295) that locates a static historical subject, but a critical, temporary method of lo- cating self-consciousness for strategic ends. Luce Irigaray also develops a type of strategic essen- tialism in This Sex Which Is Not One (1985a). She

To what extent will this room become a significant aspect of my future memories? At which point did I cease feeling a visitor in this room and more a fundamental part of it?

same knee-jerk reaction to the ego as Lacan: you have explained convincingly that for Klein the ego’s integration is a matter of being able to cope with ambivalence, anxiety, and conflict rather than an attempt to shore up mastery over the unconscious. From this vantage point, Klein’s objective is the same as Lacan’s: to dissolve the defenses that get in the way of the discourse of the unconscious. Klein just assumes that some of these defenses are more primordial than repression. I’m willing to accept that. That said, I think that Lacan’s antipathy toward the ego isn’t just about repression. It also has to do with the possibility that the subject might be overtaken by self-aggrandizing fantasies. As I’ve noted, Lacan connects the ego to the mirror stage—the idea being that the inception of the ego takes place during the mirror stage— and the obvious problem, as I’ve establish…

This facet of posthuman subjectiv- ity, then, becomes the focus of my research, the framework through which I explore our intra-dependence on “others”. The example of the avatar-gamer has allowed an explicit way to account for what it means to be posthuman, how it feels, and how posthuman subjectivity emerges and is experienced through specific entanglements. As a case study, the principles I explore in that entanglement can then be applied elsewhere. Further, by applying critical posthumanist theory to a number of analytical frameworks gleaned through empirical experiences, I can ask how the project of posthumanism can dis- rupt humanistic and anthropocentric worldviews. By claiming this digitally enabled subjectivity as posthuman, I am able to

Building on this work, and actively figuring sexing and gendering as verbs and performative pro- cesses of materialization, many of the essays in this reader attend to the ways in which queer feminist engagements with science refigure the intra- activity between biology/culture and sex/gender (Fausto-Sterling 2012; Jordan-Young 2010), and thereby provide exciting, capacious, and nondu- alistic ways of thinking about embodiment.

For me, it was photographs of Bergen-Belsen and Dachau which I came across by chance in a bookstore in Santa Monica in July 1945.’’2 Contingent on a certain naı¨vete´ and newness, located in the historical moment when ‘‘such’’ photographs (if of a kind they are) had not yet become so wide- spread and normalized, the wound occasioned by Sontag’s ﬁrst encounter has, she suggests, ceded to a world of nonstop exhibitions of atrocity, an anesthetizing and corrupting proliferation. ‘‘Once one has seen such im- ages, one has started down the road of seeing more—and more. Images transﬁx. Images anesthetize.’’3 Engaging the rhetoric and temporality of such anesthetizing repetition (t…

(p. 53) Thus, one can recognise two types of love. One is telluric, broad and com- munity based. This love was corrupted by capitalism and turned into a narcis- sistic, (semi-)detached, narrow love. The invasion of love into a public, civil sphere is understood as damaging and undermining more rational, manly forms of attachment and social engagement. The heterosexist and patriarchal con- notations of this opposition have been critiqued and explored at length by feminist scholars, most notably Lauren Berlant (2008, 2000, 2012). Alain Badiou (2009) follows a similar logic to Bauman’s but he does believe in the possibility of a ‘true’ romantic love that is not subservient to consumer capitalist logic. In Praise of Love continues the nostalgia of a seemingly lost, utopic uncor- rupted love by capitalism, while acknowledging three elements characteristic of it. First, is that love is impossi…

stitutive lack that grounds experience. I argue that Heidegger’s con- ception of death is fundamentally melancholic and as such leads Heidegger into insuperable difﬁculties in accounting for community. As Freud notes, melancholia is fundamentally narcissistic. In the second part, ‘Mourning’, I examine Hegel’s account of death from the Phenomenology of Spirit and the connection between the development of consciousness and negation. I argue that Hegel’s dependence on negation as the engine of consciousness’ development is fundamentally mournful. This conception of death leads to Hegel’s notorious difﬁ- culty in accounting for the singular. In the ﬁnal part, ‘Beatitude’, I examine Deleuze’s account of desire as productive in an effort to propose a new way of thinking about death. Notes 1.

Across twelve short stories, the spectral takes various significant forms, functioning to highlight the unexpected nature of the return, and to raise questions about the self and the Other, the individual and society, and our understandings of historical situatedness. Hauntology is motivated by an interest in illuminating a past we do not know, as well as preventing us from forgetting a history we would some- times rather not know. The conclusion draws together the readings offered by the previous four chapters to examine how and why hauntological rep- resentations in contemporary English Literature can function to highlight unresolved connections to the recent past. The representation of the haunt as repeated time in twenty-first century English literature demonstrates that the past cannot and will not be ‘fixed’. The traumas and narratives it i…

The second volume, he continues, will be different in that, examining eroticism, its concerns lie among base consumption and sovereignty, 'which cannot serve any purpose'. And yet capitalism now appears to be engaged in a massive process of autoeroticization, turning itself into a single, global erogenous zone through its marketing of endless commodified thrills. No capital, no desire: a pure, total, desiring machine. The total eroticization of the economy has little to do with advertisers' perennial attempt to sell products by associating them with sex. The totally eroticized economy opens desire on to an unlimited terrain for the ex nihilo supply of ever more commodities whose saleability alone determines whether they will have become 'useful'. Desire, here, is predicated on the absence of any final object: th…

The notion of abjection provides Kristeva with a tool for diagnosing a number of puzzling emotional responses, but she does so through appealing to their physical manifestations as much as to their pheno- menological character. This is not only because, like Freud, she sees them as expressions of drives that are opaque to their subjects, but also

body is regulated by codes of good social behavior, and repressed in and through symbolic language. For Kristeva, everything that is filthy or disor- derly or uncivilized is in the same “place” as the left-behind mother, in the realm of the abject. Like the semiotic, then, the abject is also what is sup- pressed and repressed within and through symbolic language. So this horror of the abject body is, as with the semiotic, linked with the body of the mother, but with an even more radically other mother than that addressed through the concept of the semiotic. One of Kristeva’s interests is the ways in which the necessary abjection of the mother—our separation from her in order to become individualized, to take objects, to enter language, to become good cit- izens of the family and the social world—is mistranslated into the abjection of women in general, who are reduced to the maternal function. The abject is, as we are beginning to see, a more radical alterity than the

Like Singer does with Bennett and Barad, Ellermann turns to a thinker who is not a speculative realist stricto sensu: Catherine Malabou. For Ellermann, Malabou’s study of Hegel’s aesthetics provides a theory of plasticity—art’s open-ended possibility—that can be applied to the study of poetry. He turns to Malabou’s theory of plasticity in art because “plasticity, understood as the reciprocal giving and receiving of form, already belongs to the aesthetic analysis of poetry.” He cites the “association

But the philosophical signiﬁ cance of women’s experience extends well beyond the realm of phenomenology.

ping social phenomena. In practice, this difference does not always mean very much. Judith Butler’s work, for example, is generally considered to be queer – indeed, her 1990 book Gender Trouble is often cited as one of queer theory’s inaugural acts. However, her argument that our bodies, sexualities and identities are articulated and produced through what she calls the ‘heterosexual matrix’ owes much to the writings of radical femi- nists like Rich and Wittig (as Butler herself acknowledges). One point of lasting disagreement, however, does stand out: whereas radical feminism continues to maintain that certain kinds of sexualities and identities – such as butch-femme lesbians, transexuals, drag queens, and sex workers who claim to enjoy what they do – conserve and perpetuate some of the most pernicious dimensions of heteropatriarchy, queer theory, in stark contrast, foregrounds those sam…

claim is that such crimes constitute ‘the originary exception in which human life is included in the political order in being exposed to an unlimited capacity to be killed’.13 Depoortere’s response is that Agamben provides no substantial proof of this; in his view, ‘it seems more accurate to accept what the sources explicitly say and to consider sacratio [that is the condition of the homo sacer] to be the punishment for a number of severe crimes, crimes that … affect the foundational relationships of Roman society’.14 However life is included in the political order, therefore, it is not through the mechanism that Agamben has wrongly attributed to the figure of the homo sacer, at least in Depoortere’s analysis of the primaries. Depoortere’s objection is not the only one which can be made against Agamben’s analysis and his characterization of the Western political tradition as perennially biopolitical. Even if we accepted Agamben’s analysis of homo sacer

Butler tells us that our biological anatomies do not determine our genders. The normalisation of heterosexuality is established, she further argues, as a result of long-­standing social rituals that orien­ tate us towards traditional male and female roles.

Similarly, as I will argue later in this section, Hill Collins’s concept of controlling images presumes a classically liberal subject/object binary, and thus the specific controlling images she identifies work like cinematic images, even when they appear in other media. “The male gaze” is Mulvey’s term for the structural, formal, and technical methods used in classic Hollywood cinema to naturalize patriarchal looking relations and masculine subject positions. That is, masculinity is the lens that brings otherwise incoherent, disparate elements into focus as a coherent whole. The camera, not the male/masculine protagonist, is the ultimate “bearer of the

And then, by a parallel argument, it should be a short step to using cannons as pieces of paper, or abandoned wives as CDs, in spite of each of these being quite hard things to accomplish. I should say instead that the central use of pornography, as with other words and pictures, is to excite the imagination. What is imagined is a partner, and she or he may be doing things as willingly or enthusiastically, as actively or passively, or as sensi- tively or tenderly, as the consumer’s inclinations run. People’s fantasies may not always be of sex at its best, but there is little reason to deny that they can be. Of course, this does not by itself exonerate the pornographer.

also the perceiver’s spatialization and temporalization are formed in this process of differentiation.30 Merleau-Ponty’s shift in perspectives in the description of our primordial encounter with things reflects the fact that for him there is no fusion between the visible and one’s vision, between perceiving and perceived (percipere and percipi). The two are simultaneous, “the world and I are within one another.”31 Merleau- Ponty often speaks of encroachment or intertwinement. And yet, the world and my body are not one. He articulates this encroachment also as the chiasm of the flesh of the body and the flesh of the world. The sensible dimension of the en- croachment (the element within which and as which the encroachment occurs) is, as he says, the same. He calls it flesh, we may also say Being experienced and understood in its sensibility. But the flesh of the body and the flesh of the world remain at the same time different.

Dividing human beings into "opposite sexes," seeing maleness and femaleness as the most essential attributes of our humanity, were signs of the largely invisible, taken-for-granted and all-encompassing reach of the heterosexual imperative. Gay men and lesbians were always at odds with gender, aware of their failure to fit the standard scripts of male and female behavior. The point was not, however, to celebrate an alternative gay or les­ bian identity; it was certainly not to argue, as some feminists had done, that the lesbian was the quintessential woman-identified woman. In Butler's view, affirming identity always led to the policing of identities and attempts to regulate and control the richly varied spectrum of hu­ man behaviors and desires. The aim of queer theory was to work against the grain of categories and classes, to unravel the distinctions between male and fe…

There is also evidence that seeing other people’s emotions activates the same areas as our own. Our theory of mind (i.e., of other people’s mental life-- intuitive psychology) seems not to be one inference engine, but the sum of many and, as more research is done, more modules will be discovered. Another critical feature of inference engines is that they often run in decoupled or imaginary mode while we consider the past or the future.

LaCapra’s prescription to work through the dialectics of absence and loss, and thus to produce “a condition of possibility of historicity,”69 in many ways echoes Derrida’s injunction to learn to “live otherwise, and better” by learning “to live with ghosts,” and the latter’s insistence that a history conceived as spectral would necessitate a reflection of how the past is both absent and present within the now moment, but also how the past can open up the possibilities for the future.70 However, at the same time, Derrida could be said to be guilty of a similar dehistoricizing conflation to that between loss and absence. Hauntology, as a disjointed, non-foundational alternative ontology, rivals LaCapra’s notion of absence in its tendency towards universality and transhistoricism, as becomes clear when Derrida states that “it is necessary to introduce haunting into the very construction of a concept. Of every concept, beginning with the concepts of

The Afterlives of Roland Barthes 60 this punctum therefore has roots beyond cinema and the photographic image – in Barthes’s reading of Winnicott. Pursuing this point further would require another chapter (one not focussed on mourning, film and photography). 36 CL, 60. For a fine discussion of Camera Lucida’s palinodic structure, see Jean-Claude Milner, Le Pas philosophique de Roland Barthes (Lagrasse: Éditions Verdier, 2003), 69–70. The publication in 2007 of the teaching notes from the ‘discours amoureux’ seminar of 1974–6 revealed that Barthes had been aware of the phenomenon of the palinode some years before the writing of Camera Lucida; see the session dated 8 January 1976 (DA, 319–44), where the roots in Plato are explored. 37 Jean Narboni calls Time ‘the principal character’ in Camera Lucida (La Nuit sera noire et blanche, 58). 38 Barthes’s French (JD, 184; OC V, 828) features ‘quelque chose’ in each case.

ing of sex and gender (see 148). Judith Butler’s two books Gender Trouble and Bodies Thai Matter come across as massive attempts to hammer the sex/gender distinction into poststructuralist shape. After showing that gender is performative, Butler aims to prove that vex is as constructed as gender. In her pursuit of a histor¬ ical and political understanding of the body, Butler never asks whether the sex/gender distinction actually is the best framework for her own project.

But the issue is complex. As I show in Chapter 6, Agambenian political ontology rejects the demand for the affirmation of life that char­ acterises Nietzsche’s work (and which, as Noys shows, is fundamental to certain forms of affirmationism, especially those of Deleuze and Derrida). I treat the issue of negativity at length in Chapter 4. 6. Prozorov, ‘Why Giorgio Agamben is an Optimist’, 1,054. 7. The articles in Politics, Metaphysics, and Death (ed. Andrew Norris) focus on Homo Sacer and, arguably as a result of this, many are criti­ cal of the hyperbole, lack of historical nuance and alleged pessimism of Agamben’s political philosophy (see for instance Peter Fitzpatrick’s ‘Bare Sovereignty: Homo Sacer and the Insistence of Law’, which argues

or correct an imperfection. Rather, desire is the means by which we continually make new connections in an attempt to produce some- thing new, something more powerful than we were before – in short, something that works. This conception of desire that does not seek to overcome a lack, but is itself productive, continually producing new forms, is what Deleuze and Guattari in Anti-Oedipus call ‘desiring-production’. Deleuze’s and Guattari’s argument in both Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus is that our current psychic and social organisation wildly restricts most forms of desiring-production. Desire is nor- malised within the conﬁnes of Oedipal sexuality, on the one hand, and capitalist consumption on the other. Using Deleuze’s and Guattari’s analyses I would like to examine anew the question of death, particularly as it is articulated by Heidegger and Hegel. For all of their difference…

sacralized, by the discourses of power, as its essential aspect. Agamben, however, departs from Foucault and Benjamin by seeing this notion of bare life not simply as a rupture with previous thought but as the culmination of a gradual solidiﬁ- cation, throughout history, of the link between nude or bare life and sovereign power. Thus, when he declares, for example, that “Not simple natural life, but life exposed to death (bare life or sacred life) is the originary political element,” it is in the midst of a discus- sion of Roman law, which is in this sense not so different from that of the mod- ern legal-juridical order.24 “Politicizing Death,” the penultimate chapter of Homo Sacer, opens with a reference to a 1959 study of what two French neurophysiologists termed coma de- passé (overcoma), a degree of coma, or of death’s incursion into life, involving a much greater loss of vital funct…

(and men). A feminist conceptualisation of love understands the ambiva- lence, potentially divergent, fragmentary and intersectional experience of this hegemonic romantic love and the counter-hegemonies that feminist and queer theories have pushed forward, theoretically and practically. (p. 45) How, then, does this ﬁt with researching love through its ﬁgures? I contend it ﬁts rather well. To further highlight this, I will brieﬂy discuss one of the most important ﬁgures of love, the happy ending. I argued that the burgeoning of an uncertain, ambiguous ending in some ﬁlms and its normative reception from audiences speaks to the increased romantic angst in contemporary Western societies. From a biological-evolutionary point of view, where reproduction is viewed as the single most salient end-goal of all interpersonal associations, this angst makes little or no sense. Then, why is it that th…

The engagement with Hegel's notion of experience cannot, in effect, take place.

to an inner object.30 Although she does not mention Scarry by name here, Das seems to have the critic’s work in mind in her critique of the notion that pain “destroys commu- nication or marks an exit of language.” While in Scarry’s work, social life is generated as a way to mitigate suffering that preexists it, in Das’s, suffering is coextensive with social life. This move away from epistemology in discussions of pain makes it possible to discuss pain as a problem at the core of the pro- duction of social life, rather than as something to which social life belatedly seeks to respond. Despite the obvious differences between Scarry’s epistemological account of pain and Cavell and Das’s social models, in the chapters that follow, these models are not simply opposed. Perhaps most importantly, although the epis- temological model is clearly compatible with a classical liberal emphasis …

as a quality of objects. According to Bryant, if we begin “with ontology and note that substance is such that (1) it can actualize different qualities at different times (Aristotle), and that (2) it can fail to actualize qualities (Bhaskar), we can now argue that the very essence or structure of sub­ stance lies in self-othering and withdrawal” (Bryant 2011, 85). Bryant’s main point here is that there is something in objects that continually with­ draws from interactions or relations with other objects. Important for Bryant is the idea that Bhaskar considers objects as containing qualities or powers that must be activated. Specific qualities or powers of an object are activated depending on the qualities of other objects that the first object encounters. For the most part, we only see a very limited set of qualities for each object. This limited set of available qualities is due to the fact that we relate, as humans, in a specific way to specific objects, and that we often

As Antonio explains, estab- lished authorities draw a distinction between actual spectral apparitions (vi- siones) and false representations fabricated by the imagination, which are called phantoms (fantasmas). The trouble is that when it comes to evaluating speci‹c cases, it is often impossible to separate fantasy from reality, as he says in prefacing the ‹rst of many recorded accounts of extraordinary occur- rences: “Y no sé yo de cual manera de éstas haya sido un caso muy notable que habrá poco más de treinta años acaeció dos leguas de donde estamos” (And I do not know which of these types may have been a notable case that occurred thirty years ago two leagues from where we are).

(BP 126). As I suggested in my discussion of neurology and the body image, intense pain can be read as an especially urgent figure (more urgent, I would venture, than feelings of extreme pleasure) for that tension that produces, even as it threatens, the persistent fantasy of a complete, coherent body; pain radicalizes, in other words, that normally constitutive, but always potentially destructive, oscillation between tendencies totalizing and dis- ruptive. In reality conferring, however, the “reality” or “extreme attributes” of bodily damage are not just in conflict with an idea of relative composure or of ontological stability; instead, the very force of that conflict—the somatic extremity of the tension itself—is abstracted (“translated”) from its basis in conflict, is felt no longer as aversive equivocation but as certainty, resolve, moral or ideological legitimacy. This distance, th…

As I discuss shortly, insofar as a nonrepre sen ta tional focus of materialist histo- ries of film and media is salutary, such approaches also do not admit of a spe- cifically gendered and bodily materiality. Girl Head, by contrast, maintains a concept of materiality in which sexual and racial differences are intrinsically inscribed. This means that the female body is transformed— sometimes sym- bolically, sometimes also literally— into material to be used in film production practices. The motivations for and significant costs resulting from this pro cess of materialization are addressed in the experimental and feminist works dis- c…

enjoyment could be deﬁned as the ﬁnal result of eliminating the discrepancy between need and desire generated via the fateful ontogenetic detour through the mediation of demand, Lacan reiterates, in this later context, the earlier critiques of utopianism articulated in the ﬁfth and seventh seminars. Reaching for an underemployed distinction deployed in the twentieth seminar of 1972-1973, the various utopias Lacan has in mind can be interpreted as fantasmatic anticipations of “jouissance expected” — this expected jouissance, for several psychoanalytic reasons, is never equivalent to any instance of the “jouissance obtained” under desire-driven constraints.44 Obviously, the kind of utopia rendered unattainable by the impossibility of jouissance (as an actually realized state of full, undiluted enjoyment) is that of an entirely happy set of sustainable circumstances in which all serious dissatisfactions are resolved without remainder,

In order to argue for hauntology as the appropriate language for speak- ing of basic human experiences, one may think of a few layers of signifi- cance. At the very core of these so-called layers would be meaning and its formation, which is so closely entangled with the formation of desire as to be considered one and the same. This core duo sets the foundation of the range of human subjective experiences including thought, speech, textual- ity, and temporality, along with drive, affect, power, and politicality. The ensemble of these effects translates in turn into what we identify as the domain of ontology, and its subsidiary, epistemology. Simply put, the call to hau…

practice of improvisation within a scene of constraint,” and for Butler the question of gender involves two different kinds of inquiry.11 The first is a description of the limits of intelligibility that constitute the borders of gender, and attention to how that constitution designates some subjects as livable and marks others as abject. Butler emphasizes the mutually constituting nature of these different positions, where that which is unassimilable to the domain of proper gender must still persist as a necessary and structuring ideal, giving coherence and boundedness to the category that excludes it. Her discussions of gender melancholia, most fully explicated in The Psychic Life of Power, describe just this structure, whereby those homosexual attachments that must be repudiated in order for the subject to achieve normative sexuality (and also gender) remain alive and stubbornly held at the heart of heterosexuality.

of the film. From a picture-scenario pinned on the board, Cournoyer and the editor move the fragments around, threading the series of metamorphoses together. It is in the process of taking these fragments, each of which has its own meaning, and linking them together that an emotion, a guiding line, maybe even a narrative, emerges. Cournoyer then returns to her drawing board to fill in gaps between sequences of metamorphoses. At that point the narrative might take on a completely different direction. So a large part of the editing of the film happens along the way, without the editor actually hav- ing to make any cuts: in the end, the sequence of metamorphoses gives the impression that the film is a long, unbroken single shot.

and the Invisible and Eye and Mind. While we have already outlined his ontological position in these works, it is necessary — if we are to complete the picture — to situate this within the general perspective of his phenomenological psychology, with particular reference to his key dis- tinction between ‘primordial’ and ‘secondary’ expression. Towards an ontology of style In The Structure of Behaviour (1942) and, more importantly, The Phenomenology of Perception (1945), Merleau-Ponty advances the no- tion of a primordial expression by means of which the body-subject structures its experience in a movement towards equilibrium. This primordial structuring of the environment by an organism constitutes a 131

signifiers, of the text as “a playing; the generation of the perpetual signifier,” is a prominent feature of the French theoretical context in which both Barthes and Kristeva elaborate their approach to literature (158). It draws from, but extends, Saussure’s semiological formulation of the sign as a relation between a signifier and a signified, seeing in his model – as Kristeva suggests – “heretofore unrecognized possibilities of envisioning language as a free play, forever without closure.”25 And just as Saussure’s theory informs Jacques Lacan’s description of the unconscious as an endless “signifying chain” of metonymic associa- tions in which signifiers refer to other signifiers, so does it offer a vision of literary or textual signification in which referential meaning is potentially “infinite” (158).26 Barthes suggests that a text so conceived necessarily changes the kind of interp…

The Subject of Rosi Braidotti 4 important mediating device, connecting different scholarly and activist communities and generations. Staying with the scholarly for now, we want to highlight that Braidotti’s essentially feminist philosophical work has traveled to, and been received in, the various devel- oping disciplines and paradigms that have found their way to institutionalization since the liberalization of higher education in the 1960s. In particular, we wish to mention her work on citizenship and nation-states, Science and Technology Studies (STS), and cultural and media studies. Although the interdisciplinary influence of Braidotti’s “new brand of materialism of the embodied and embedded kind” (Braid- otti 2011e, p. 129) may be unsurprising to those familiar with the intricate nature of the technologized bureaucracy of governments in and after states of war, and of the cou…

bodily limits Karen Barad develops in her philosophical elaboration of an agential realism. Barad explains convincingly that in looking at the outer limits of “­human beings” on the one hand and of “apparatuses” (or media devices) on the other, visual clues can be quite misleading. Instead, she as- serts, “­human bodies, like all other bodies, are not entities with inherent bound­aries and properties but phenomena that acquire specific bound­aries and properties through the open-­ended dynamics of intra-­activity.”25 Es- pecially ­because it is made not by a biologist but a physicist, this assertion does, I think, confirm my approach of looking at the genesis of bodily and technical surfaces from the inside. The specific form this book has fi­nally taken is that of a fictitious exhibi- tion. This is not to say that from this point forward, pre­sen­ta­tion ­will re- place explanation, indication supplant argumentation. Rather, the fiction

that writing must be bisexual (which recalls Woolf’s notion of androgyny): ‘There is no invention of other I’s, no poetry, no fiction without a certain homosexuality’ (Cixous 1981b:97). Luce Irigaray employs many elements of Lacanian psychoanalysis in her work. She describes women’s writing as parler femme: ‘her language in which “she” goes off in all directions and in which “he” is unable to discern the coherence of any meaning. Contradictory words seem a little crazy to the logic of reason, and inaudible for him who listens with ready-made grids, a code prepared in advance’ (Irigaray 1985:103). Again, we can see a recuperation of qualities which are attributed to women by men. She believes that women are able to use this type of language because, as she says, our sexual morphology is multiple and based on contiguity, in contrast to male sexuality which is unitary; thus she locates the …

Cinema I: The Movement-Image, Hugh Tomlinson and Barbara Habberjam [trans.] [Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1986], xiv). This explains, moreover, the centrality of Henri Bergson in his analysis, whose philosophical thinking on movement and time is strictly coextensive with the thinking of movement and time within the history of filmic images (this is made extremely explicit in the recordings of Deleuze’s seminar entitled Gilles Deleuze: Cinéma [Paris: Gallimard, 2006]). However, this proximity between Badiou and Deleuze is only partial. As we will see, for Badiou film is the impure art par excellence, which constantly runs the risk of slipping into simple entertainment or dissolving the strict limits that structure the relationship between the arts. Although I am borrowing this expression from Rancière, I am not using it in the exact same sense that he does in La Parole muette.

The skeptic-on-duty of a decaying world” (Anathemas 14). As Michael Finkenthal explains, “Skepticism is in a way paralyzing. One ends in doubting one’s own doubts” (150). Cioran’s writing enacts a mode of pessimistic skepticism in which self-scrutiny becomes a circum- spect, ex post facto vehicle for positing the conditions, traps, and pitfalls of human existence. In fact, Cioran approaches even the self-reception of his own writing work through a lens of sardonic self-scrutiny: “Each time I find myself assigning some importance to things, I incriminate my mind, I challenge it and suspect it of some weakness, of some depravity. I try to wrest myself from eve…

this boundary even more radically, and Gothic science fiction often features horror at the prospect that technology might annihilate, liquefy or col- lapse the human corporeal presence into mutant, grotesque forms. ‘Bodies’, Botting writes, ‘are repeatedly invaded, penetrated, slashed, possessed, snatched, manipulated and controlled in the horrors that link gothic and science fictions’ (Gothic Romanced 145). The human body becomes a focus for ambivalent transformative possibility, dissolution, agency and the struggle between otherness and self. In this regard, Julia Kristeva’s concept of abjection is pivotal: the ‘abject’ is that which simultaneously revolts and fascinates us by triggering the fantasy that we might be violated and consumed, a horror which we repudi­ ate by constructing the abject catalyst as obscene, filthy and grotesque (4, 10, 13). Kelly Hurley deploys the Kristevan abject in her analysis of

Although a thoroughgoing treatment of such commit· ments is beyond the scope of this essay, in the final chapter I will try to defend the ethical plausibility of the political analyses and philosophy of the poststructuralists. Such a defense will not only involve laying out certain ethical positions; once seen, they may prove to be fairly uncon• troversial. Of more importance-and of more moment, because the poststructuralists have always avoided overt discussion of ethics--is a picture of what ethics is, a metaethical picture, which will lend compre• hensibility to many of the specific theoretical interventions and reti· cences of poststructuralist discourse. That picture displays ethical life not as a matter of foundations upon which political analyses are con•

willingness of the subject to misrecognize itself, allowing the characters on the screen to stand in for its own subject position. With this point, Heath comes very close to the conception of the “gaze,” or more appropriately, the “male gaze,” as it was developed by Laura Mulvey. The “Gaze” Mulvey’s explicit aim in “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema” is to appropriate psychoanalysis for political purposes but in order to identify the phallocentrism of mainstream cinema. Unlike Oudart, who claims that mainstream cinema is in the business of recreating desire through lack/loss by inducing some sense of unpleasure on the part of the spectator, Mulvey argues that mainstream cinema actually produces pleasure for the specta- tor. This, she claims, is in accordance with “the unconscious of patriarchal society,” which has “structured film form.”40 Patriarchal society, according to M…

Enion responds with a reciprocal desire to “hide from [Tharmas’s] searching eyes” and weaves a tabernacle for Jerusalem out of sinewy threads from her bosom (Erdman, 1982, p. 302): the creation of yet another shadowy female. Tharmas dies, and his corpse sinks down into the sea, but Enion draws his Spectre out of his feet. Enion then draws out Tharmas’s every nerve to build “Her woof of terror” (Erdman, 1982, p. 302). This weav- ing takes nine days and nights—the nine nights of the poem—and as she works her woof, it begins to take on a life and “will / Of its own perverse & wayward” (Erdman, 1982, p. 302). When her work is complete, she fi nds herself “Terrifi ed in her own Creation” (Erdman, 1982, p. 303). Enion’s woof dominates the drama’s psychological landscape and symbolizes one female response to male unfaithfulness—bitter hiding, the shadowy female’s cloud.

What these texts do that most love poetry does not is to cause a confrontation between these two beliefs. And it is only at the mo- ment at which the treatises oblige their readers to see the gap between these fictions and another level of thought that the nature of the illusions becomes clear. This interpretive method teaches the reader how fictional lovers be- have and what that rdle demands. It also shows the reader how to bridge the gap between his or her individual identity and the identity of the reader inscribed in the texts, and demonstrates the power of literary con- ventions and the pleasures of amatory fiction. Such reading is itself a kind of love, as Roland Barthes notes: the reader participates in an erotic rela- tionship with the text,*! and through this erotic interaction the reader

surprisingly, The Idol and Distance contains a detailed engagement with the tradition of negative theology (in the figure of Pseudo- Dionysius the Areopagite whose works were written in the late fifth and early sixth century c e ). Perhaps more unexpectedly for a work of theology, it also contains a sustained reading of the Nietzschean motif of the Death of God. Here, Marion argues that Nietzsche announces only the death of the God of metaphysics (the God of being, substance, etc.), and that the Nietzschean twilight and demise of idols leaves open a space of absence which, in its very absence and withdrawal, can all the more properly be called divine. This persistence of the divine in Nietzschean thought is marked most clearly, according to Marion, in the way in which it is haunted by Christ and Christ-like figures: the Anti-Christ, Dionysus, Zarathustra and so on. Both these early works open up philosophical concerns and lines

and that in nature all events are instances of causal regularity. That this notion contains an important insight is the fundamental challenge to the possibility of normativity that Davidson's philosophical account of inter- pretation is designed to meet. As the remark quoted above indicates, from this point of view it is unproblematic, a matter of course, that we have dispositions, causally defined states-the question is how states describable in terms of causal regularities can also be captured in the normative terms of the language of agency. The philosophical gain that is promised us is that we become able to see, from this perspective, how the normatively laden intentional concepts of the vocabulary of agency can get a grip by virtue of obser- vation of the behavior of other creatures, behavior that we can also observe and describe in a nonintentional vocabulary. So no even…

Aesthetic surgery is a serious business—involving risk, pain, cutting, family concerns, the desire for self-improvement—calculated to meet the demand that social subjects care for and control the body, that they not deny themselves beauty, or passively give up control of their psychophysical selves. Persons who appear on the show surely experience this range of considerations and exigencies, and to some extent confirm reputable psychological and soci- ological work on body image as central to self-image, self-understanding, and social success. As we have seen, “abjection” refers to the casting off of the unwanted other; in bodily terms, this is made up of the waste and fluids that suggest death, disorder, and the lack of clear boundaries. Kristeva is interested also, though not extensively, in abjection as a social phenomenon: how the woman and the racial other, for instance, come to be abjected in culture. The analogy

In addressing them, we unavoidably ﬁnd ourselves having to think in new ways about the nature of matter and the matter of nature; about the elements of life, the resilience of the planet, and the distinctiveness of the human. These questions are immensely important not only because they cast doubt on some of modernity’s most cherished beliefs about the fundamental nature of existence and social justice but also because presumptions about agency and causation implicit in prevail- ing paradigms have structured our modern sense of the domains and dimensions of the ethical and the political as such.

Turning to this scene now, a number of indicators suggest to the viewer that Erika’s act is habitual. The precise and practiced way that she positions herself on the side of the bathtub is suggestive of repeated activity and the razor blade stored conveniently in her purse further cements this impression.

In this sense, noise in the films discussed also works as a fig- ure that de-situates bodies, un-grounding them and drawing them into more open, unstable or dissensual relation with others that characterises the corps sonore. Such was the case with Breillat’s body, in abeyance and excess, carried in the transport of little noises that resist at the point of our listening while also carrying the body beyond itself. Likewise, Noé’s use of inaudible fre- quencies and unpleasant sound that dominate his images, working to desta- bilise subjectivity and appeal to the body of spectator and film as an open place of resonance, traversed by the violent vibratory effects of noise. For Gatlif and des Pallières, noise allowed them a means to open the corps sonore to an écho-monde, a world of sonorous mixings and contaminations to which we are relationally tied, and that cinema makes palpable as a space filled with

In the following chapters I will begin to map out the case for this argument. r will begin with a discussion of the work of Gilbert Ryle (1949). This will allow me to elaborate upon the arguments, raised in this chapter, regarding the meanings of our various mental concepts. Following this, in Chapter 5, 1 will be considering the model of embodied agency developed in the work of Merleau-Ponty (1962, 1965). In Merleau-Ponty's work we will find a powerful and persuasive model of the human agent as a whole which is greater than the sum of its physical parts; one which resonates very strongly with the issues of meaning and purpose that we have raised in this chapter. Note 1. This argument is complkated, slightly, by the fact that neuroscientific language has now entered the vernacular - albeit to serve 'folk psychological' purposes.

Noise indexes the world in ways that are not so appropriable to human consciousness, presenting something alien to our understanding as it works against phe- nomenological manifestation and the representations we have of things. In its engagement of the auditory and, in conjunction with images that noise then works against, cinema constitutes a sensuous opening for the possibil- ity of indicating a nonhuman outside. In the examples looked at here, such moments are posited but ultimately undercut, reflecting the difficulty in tack- ling the nonhuman on its own terms. Each area of my inquiry has attempted to feel its way out of the recto–­verso logic of correlationism that Meillassoux identifies.

move that is similar to that made by many theorists, from Theodor Adorno to Jean Franc¸ois Lyotard.1 I begin with Agamben as somebody whose work is increasingly taken up by scholars in several ﬁelds, from literary studies and philosophy to political science, and whose work em- bodies some of the most difﬁcult challenges testimony poses to the philosophic consideration of atrocity. Beginning with a reading of the term ‘‘witness’’ and the meanings it takes on in the discourse of survi- vors such as Primo Levi, Agamben marks the Muselman (that inmate who was so starved and otherwise destroyed that he or she no longer exhibited basic elements of consciousness despite continuing a physical existence of some sort) as the physical marker of what he, in Levi’s terms, calls a ‘‘grey zone’’ between the human and the nonhuman and between life and death. The importance of the Muselman for Agamben is…

INTRODUCTION 13 FEMINIST TRANSPOSITIONS In part 2 of this volume I will apply some of my key concepts to the produc- tion of alternative interventions in the present contextual conditions. Given the complex and internally contradictory nature of the globalized system, feminist critical theory needs to innovate in its very tools of analysis. The current cultural paradoxes: on the one hand, rising conservatism, on the other, fascination with changes and mutant and nonunitary others, express both a deep anxiety about the fast rate of transformation of identities and also the poverty of our social imaginary to cope creatively with the ongoing transformations. In rising to this challenge, feminist theory engages with contemporary scientiﬁ c advances and new understandings of the structure of bodies and matter (see chapter 5, “Matter-Realist Feminism”). Feminism is the social and theoretical movement that, more than any

We have lost our way but we can get it back, if we apply a little common sense to our current situation. We may have been con- vinced by the turn to language, a poststructuralist capacity to deconstruct power and value difference, but we know better now. We know now that critique does not alter power relations and indeed that these have endured and strengthened. We know now that postmodern feminism leads to relativism and political incapacity, while women everywhere remain dis- advantaged. Perhaps earlier feminist theories might still have something to teach us about what we have in common as women, despite the valuable critiques of essentialism that have come since. On the bright side, we do not have to accept the opposition between fragmentation and unity; we

CHAPTER THREE « From Performance to Performatives 73 up the idea of gender as a performance, Bornstein focuses on the fun one can have with it. Just as one can play King Lear in different ways, so, too, can one play gender in different ways: as a serious self-expression, as a campy RuPaul drag routine, or as a medley of different gender exhibitions, Finally, Butler pushes performance in a performative direction by ques- tioning the mode of being of the “one” who is playing King Lear or a spe- cific gender. For Butler, the expressions of gender produce or construct the gendered subject so that talk of a material body, a sex, behind the expres- sions of gender makes no sense. We have also considered the effect on fem- inism of this trajectory from performance to performative construction. Butler tries to rescue feminism by turning it into a resignifying subversion of gender norms. Nussbaum remains her harshest critic. For her, Butler

Céline Surprenant stays with the question of Derrida’s account of the body and/ in psychoanalysis by examining Derrida’s complex stance towards the neuro- sciences. The vivid and avid nature of Derrida’s engagement with psychoanalysis – which spanned more than forty years and through which he refined his notions of, for example, the trace, the inscription and the archive – should not belie the fact that his readings of Freud were also the occasion for the re-examination and confrontation of the psychoanalytic corpus. Yet, Surprenant argues, Catherine Malabou, in formulating her notion of plasticity and in moving towards a neuropsychoanalysis, puts Freud’s and Derrida’s understanding of trace on a par. Derrida’s apparent initial rejection of the neurosciences is founded, Surprenant argues, on the belief in the existence of a Freudian psyche, which is also a condition for his inte…

especially Foucault. To think about Bataille, Foucault, and religion, it is important to read the older project forward into Foucault’s books of the 1970s—to volume 1 of his History of Sexuality, of course, but, more im- mediately, more strikingly, to Surveiller et punir, which we know in English as Discipline and Punish. Foucault’s Sacred Sociology Discipline and Punish opens with a grisly tableau, the prolonged public torture of Damiens, condemned in 1757 for attempting to assassinate Louis XV. The first twelve paragraphs of the book are extended quota- tions from archival descriptions of the public torture—the published trial proceedings, a newspaper account, firsthand testimony by a police official. Their combined effect is to afhx this gruesome image to the front of the book—just where Acéphale liked to put its image of the disemboweled priest-victim. Or to remind us of B…

and writing. There is a connection between the over-representation of pain and its unrepresentability. So, for example, I may not be able to describe ‘ade- quately’ the feelings of pain, and yet I may evoke my pain, again and again, as something that I have. Indeed, I may repeat the words ‘pain’ or ‘hurts’ precisely given the difﬁculty of translating the feeling into descriptive lan- guage. The vocabularies that are available for describing pain, either through medical language that codiﬁes pain (see Burns, Busby and Sawchuk 1999: xii) or through metaphor that creates relations of likeness (see Scarry 1985), seem inadequate in the face of the feeling.

my project emphasizes the double nature of the ghost proposed by Derrida: the ghost as both revenant that returns the past to attention and arrivant that announces possible futures. While Derrida and Gordon do not address the environmental potentialities of ghosts, their insistence on letting ghosts remain provides a strong framework for thinking about them as agents of social justice that can be usefully extended to address environmental concerns and nonhuman histories. Derrida begins his influential exploration, Specters of Marx, by asserting: It is necessary to speak of the ghost, indeed to the ghost and with it, from the moment that no ethics, no politics, whether revolutionary or not, seems possible and thinkable and just that does not recognize in its principle the respect for those others who are no longer living or for those others who are not yet there, presently living, whether they are dead or not yet born.24

This sense of Heaney placing the violence of both cultures together gives the ghosts of the past a body within his poetry, the spectres of Northern Irish violence and Scandinavia now have an eternal place within the poetry and act as a warning but also as a way of understanding. Derrida would sug­ gest that the poem is a spectral entity, a ghostly body that preserves these past ideas as ‘a ghost of the ghost’ (2006, 158) and a site that cannot cre­ ate new futures because the past always has a trace in the present moment, something which Mark Fisher suggests in Ghosts of My Life in terms of lost futu…

Both poets rather openly exhibit what I call Lacanian desire, and it is my intention that the reader, after reflecting upon my text, respond more fully to this trope as it peaks early in both Coleridge and Keats.16 Not surprisingly at this point in our critical histories, then, Words¬ worth establishes the vocabulary for a discussion of desire as the motor J of Romantic poetry, in many ways a local rather than strictly literary decision on my part, inspired because of the suspiciously congenial home he has found in recent cultural materialist studies. In a compli¬ cated way, this is to say that our current normal reading of the “real” Wordsworth depends upon our assumption that he either consciously or unconsciously translated political anxieti…

of sovereign power. In this sense, biopolitics is at least as old as the sovereign exception.’ (Agamben 1998, 6) Before delving into the critique of this provocative thesis, let us return to the dualism of zoe and bios that Agamben appears to dismantle all too quickly and pose the question of the subjectivities, constituted in these two modes of life. The dualism of zoe and bios ﬁnds its correlate forms of subjectivity in the ﬁgures of man and citizen. Foucault’s famous distinction between sovereignty and biopower speciﬁes these forms of subjectivity in terms of two ‘games’ of power relations: the ‘city-citizen’ game of the Greek polis, which, through a detour into the

and lack of clarity. When Bennett suggests that non-human assemblages can act, what she actually seems to mean is that assemblages can have an impact or effect on humans and non-humans. Here, Bennett is conflating the idea of the properties and powers of beings and things, and the notion of action and the idea of agency, and there are serious questions to be raised about her assumption that a distributed concept of agency will be effective in unsettling humancentric politics (Bennett, 2010: 13). We have suggested above that the problem with ‘thing-power’ however, is an over-comparison of the liveliness of beings. In minimising the importance of distinction, Bennett loses sight of the important differentiations of species and other things and in particular of the notion of the persistent power relations that reproduce the human-centred institutions and practices of our anthropocentric world. This problem of non-human agency haunts the work of animal studies scholars,

Eros appears in the way our friends invite us into their con- ﬁdences, the worlds of their emotions and suﬀerings, and in the beauty of their beloved faces. We can feel similarly about the erotic pull into a book or a painting or a forest, so absorbed by our sensual response that everything else recedes. We do ourselves a great dis- service in reducing the pleasure of erotic intimacy to that which involves our genitalia. The astounding range of our senses and emotions deﬁes the categories into which we seek to subdue them. Philosophy by another name, then: reﬂection on the material of life. Love is not beyond thinking. But it requires the kind of thinking that bends, that accepts the limits of reason and takes the risk of moving beyond the order of the reasonable to the confusion of the emo…

She is also more positive about its others, such as grumpiness and melancholy. Cruel Optimism is a more formalist work than either of these projects. Here, optimism manifests in attachments and the desire to sustain them: attachment is a structure of relationality. But the experience of affect and emotion that attaches to those relations is as extremely varied as the con- texts of life in which they emerge. An optimistic attachment is invested in one’s own or the world’s continuity, but might feel any number of ways, from the romantic to the fatalistic to the numb to the nothing. I therefore make no claims about what specific experiential modes of emotional reflexivity, if any, are especially queer, cool…

the very labor-saving advantages of photo-technologies have seemed to some (Emerson 1981, Kracauer 1979, Scruton 1990) so to weaken the scope of conceptualized content in photography, as to compromise or even defeat its status as ﬁne art. Accepting these considerations, some photographers have actually been sanguine about photography’s being something other than art (such as Brassaï), whereas others have either defended the degree of photog- raphers’ control (Weston 1980b, 1981), or redeﬁned it as a perceptual, not a physical, action. Yet one can hardly consider such matters without ﬁrst identifying the entity or aspect that is or is not controlled or conceptualized.

(Scarry 47– 48) This demonstrates the use of “stress positions” as a means of torture, illustrated by the passage from Dieckmann’s novel I quoted, above. The passage from the novel also illustrates how pain isolates the experience of individuals in an interiority which is seemingly inacces- sible to others, leading, as Scarry notes, to a “split between one’s sense of one’s own reality and the reality of other persons” (4). Pain, particu- larly the deliberate heightening and amplification of it by torture, dissolves the relationship between the subject and language, reducing language …

traits. This position harbours an irreducible ambiguity, however, between an escape from the host capacities approach and its hyperbolisation, and according to this latter reading what Malabou offers us is nothing more than a host meta-capacity. Nevertheless, her notion of plasticity does allow her to develop a figure of the human that is universal, material, monist and immanent to itself. In the second half of Chapter 3 I explore Malabou’s determination to initiate a new plastic encounter between philosophy and neuroscience, eschewing both the ‘cognitivist’ position of neuroscientist Jean-Pierre Changeux and the ‘Continental’ resistance to neuroscience of Paul Ricœur, in order to elaborate her own ‘neuronal materialism’ (QF 162/WSD 69) in terms of what she calls ‘destructive plasticity’. In an attempt to develop this neuronal materialism in a way that avoids plastic- ity becoming one more defunct metaphor of the human, I offer a reading

For Irigaray is also indicating with the emblem of two lips another facet of her work that does not want simply to react to the exclusions of male theory – however conducive to jouissance they may be. For Irigaray also wants, by using the play of mimesis in a productive mode, to deploy the two lips as an emblem for women’s alternative constructive capabilities. Irigaray will herself admit that women’s self- representation cannot remain sequestered in private mystical trysts, if it is to redress the imbalance that has, until now, distorted both human and divine relationships ‘To remain within the limit of the senses in one’s suffering or one’s jouissance – both of them imaginary – is not the same as acceding to the creation of imagination’ (1993b: 161–2). For this purpose, the ‘not-all’ of Lacan with its inferences of lack becomes the ‘not-one’ of the ‘two lips’ for Irigaray – a new

ontological, ethical and political questions. For some time, feminist philosophers and scholars of science studies and cul- tural studies, like Braidotti, Hayles and Barad, have deployed the notion of the posthuman to imaginatively link politics and subjectivity. They have done so in order to break or otherwise overcome the ﬁxed, dyadic, and hierarchical categories of nature and culture, or the human and the nonhuman, thereby enabling alterna- tive analyses that explore the entanglements and mutual co-constitutions that result. For Karen Barad, “posthumanism marks a refusal to take the distinction between ‘human’ and ‘nonhuman’ for granted, and to found analysis on this pre- sumably ﬁxed and inherent set of categories” (Barad 2007, 32). For N. Katherine Hayles, the posthuman signals both a problem and a possibility: If my nightmare is a culture inhabited by posthumans who regard their bo…

writes, “is assenting to life even in death.” Bataille’s eroticism remains grounded in a humanist subject- position of sovereignty (doomed insofar as it is precisely the position eroticism seeks to overcome), a transformational aesthetics that assumes movement between subjects and objects rather than a ﬂat ontology of objects alone, and a gen- dered dynamic that cannot begin to hold up to contemporary femi- nist analysis. Still, Bataille’s erotic ideas about eschewing subjecthood through excess, unholy alliances, and nonlife are inﬂuential for object- oriented feminism. Like laughter, fomenting erotic fusion with an object, as a means of becoming object, is a creative, generative act. Such important prehistories for today’s object- orientation also include feminist practices around the body, like fetishistic subcultures and body art. While as we have seen, with Sprinkle’s performance, some strategic, erotic reclamations of objecthood can make us laugh,

vi About This Book brittle stars, economic markets, and landfills, we must re-distribute agency to include nonhuman, and even nonliving objects. If we grant that nonhu­ man and nonliving objects are capable of a quasi-­agency, then we can also grant them the possibility of actuating a kind of wonder. Both new mate­ rialism and object-oriented ontology work to challenge the idea that humans can gain absolute access to the world. The world is a buzzing, vibrating, swirl of self-organizing activity that iterates its own becoming and no amount of knowledge can overcome the gap between knower and known. Rather than reduce the world to our knowledge, new materialism and object-oriented ontology reveal that the world is incapable of being fully grasped. As such, our own sense of wonder cannot be disregarded by a knowledge that we cannot obtain. I end the chapter by placing wonder between objects. This is initially described in terms of Merleau-Ponty’s

Which is to say, we must first lose ourselves in the human so as to rediscover ourselves as alive” (2014, 47). And yet, elsewhere, Agamben asserts, “While fire can only burn, and other living beings are only capable of their own specific potentialities—­they are capable of only this or that behavior inscribed into their biological vocation—­human beings are the animals capable of their own impotentiality” (2011b, 44). This is the sophisticated human- ist double gesture par excellence, trademarked by Heidegger, and reli- censed by Agamben, in which the species-­without-­qualities is shown to be the privileged ontological subject by virtue of its own unqualified status. Humans, so the argument goes, are the only species useless enough—­ ontologically gormless enough—­to ascend to a kind of ironic–­aesthetic

DOI: 10.4324/9781003281085-11 Much of the discourse, both scholarly and popular, surrounding meaning and (im)mortality is directed at making death seem natural, necessary, and maybe even beneficial for beings like us. It is not just the work of curmudgeonly contemporary philosophers, authors of fiction, and reli- gious figures that I am talking about; these ideas dominate mainstream culture in part through the ever more ubiquitous mass of “self-help”-style pop-philosophy that finds its roots in ancient teachings from places such as Greece and India. There seems to be an assumption amongst purveyors of these ideas that fear of “natural” death is rampant and dangerous because it might lead to depression and diminished quality of life. This assumption is often coupled with a belief that a similarly pervasive long- ing for immortality, and even less-permanent forms of life extension, only contributes to the problem.1 These are not the trends I notice from my vantage point.

Trump’s energising of a significant sector of the rural working class has seen them demonised as monstrously out of control. As this study has tried to prove, the continuing discomfort that many in the U.S. feel “when forced to acknowledge the existence of poverty” (Isenberg, 319) finds its most interesting representation in the nation’s horror fiction. Whether this means horror is a politically transgressive format or a con- servative “safety valve” (Johnson, 105) negating radical feeling is a mat- ter for subjective interpretation. What cannot be disputed is that horror addresses the blind spots in the national psyche, providing a platform for what Isenberg describes as the “disturbing thread in our national nar- rative” (321). Be it in the form of the serial killer or the vampire, the Lovecraftian Great Old Ones or the zombie, the genre serves as a tool through which the read…

as somehow ‘natural’, plasticity can open up possibilities for the affirmation of free agency and for the renewal or transformation of those very structures. In this way, the emphasis on the self-fashioning of consciousness, subjectiv- ity or selfhood that lies at the centre of Hegel’s phenomenology and Malabou’s early-career rereading of Hegel can be shown to play out throughout the further development of her philosophical thinking conjointly and in an interrelated man- ner across the realms of neurobiology, culture, politics and social organisation. Openings The myriad ways in which the concept of plasticity opens on to different domains of interrogation and inquiry is reflected in the breadth and diversity of the essays collected in this volume. Divided into four parts, the collection clearly demonstrates that this diversity, however initially daunting in its scope, range and i…

a cultural theory of social performance 16 cultural history has been understood allegorically (see also Clifford 1986, 1988). It is narrated as a process of disenchantment, as a fall from Eden, as declension from a once golden age of wholeness and holiness (Sherwood 1994). The assertion is that once representation is encased in some artiﬁ cial substance, whether it is substantively or only formally rational, it becomes mechanical and unmeaningful. The classical theoretical statement of this allegory remains Walter Benjamin’s (1968 [1936]) “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” veneration (!) for which has only grown among postmodern critics bent on exposing the artiﬁ ciality of the present age. Benjamin holds that the auratic quality of art, the aura that sur- rounded it and gave it a sacred and holy social status, is inherently diminished by art’s reproduci…

(HS: 121) The emergence in the eighteenth century of a discourse on children's sexualtty and the power relations generated by it plays a central part in Foucault's biohistory, joining several of his projects in ways that have only been partially explored. He calls upon it to instantiate his rejection of the repressive hypothesis, to repudiate both Marx and Freud, and to speCify those mechanisms and techniques of power that operate in productive, intimate, and capillary form. Despite this emphasis, Foucault's treatment of the "pedagogization of children's sexuality," like volume 1 ofThe History of Sexuality, is schematic and telegraphic. But, like that volume,…

is the question of the desire for recognition. This is what links sexuality with identity in Lacan, on the same axis. It results, on Lacan’s account, in identity’s being lived through the love relation, through the erotic relation. This represents the thoeretical condensation of the master/slave dialectic onto the subject/object relation. Since the subject is divided, it has identity only in relation to the other (who or whatever that may be)—this was established in the mirror stage. Thus, in love one performs an operation which intimately concerns oneself. As evident from the mirror stage, Lacanian psychoanalysis can be read as a story about the securing of consciousness, which is neither a departure from Freud, nor yet from Hegel. At the level of the question of identity, Lacan proposes that the subject has two imaginary wishes, in the recognition sought in the love relation…

of the collection. The poem's narrator expresses admiration for the poem's male addressee in terms that recall the old erotic topos of amor de lonh, claiming he has fallen in love with him from a distance.' This unnamed addressee, the gentle spirit, is exhorted to act out the narrator's own violent erotic fantasy of pulling the old lady of Rome by the hair. Taking violent possession of the beloved is eccentric to the usually passive attitude of the weeping Petrarchan lover. The re- vival of Rome requires the will to dominate, whereas the love of Laura demands humility, fear, pallor, servitude. Yet the similarity between these two loves, which I would like to explore here, is in an underlying morbid eroticism, the uncanny allure of scattered remains and lifeless body parts. This macabre aspect of the lover's carnal obsession with Laura, idealized in the gemlike verses of the rime sparse, is made explicit in the Latin prose of the

privileged the notion of a generous, other-regarding love as the foundation of ethical relations between self and other, notwithstanding the attendant difﬁcul- ties that have also accompanied the practice of this ethic. These difﬁculties will be addressed in more detail in Chapters 1 and 2, but particularly in Chapter 2, where I will be considering the recent work of a number of feminist theologians who extend and develop the earlier insights of Valerie Saiving concerning the orthodox emphasis on the sacriﬁcial aspect of agapic love. In bringing a gender analysis to bear on their reﬂections on divine love, many feminist theologians, as previously noted, have opted to abandon the concept of agape, believing it to be irredeemably patriarchal and incapable of signifying the mutual love of equals. In balancing their feminist and theological commitments, many have turned to the notions of mutuality and a reconceived eros, to recon-

At the root of the problem of sexual difference is the fact that woman as subject is missing from the western tradition. That tradition presupposed the symmetry of the sexes, the “old dream of symmetry,” that obliterated the identity of women. Rejecting this, Irigary tries to define the female subject as distinct, different. We must reinter­ pret the relationship between the subject and discourse, the subject and the world, in the new world we are creating (1987: 119). Irigaray’s goal, as Elizabeth Grosz puts it, is to represent woman “otherwise” than in phallocratic terms (1989: 110). In This Sex Which Is Not One (1985b) Irigaray famously defines this “otherwise” of woman as “not one” because she does not have one sex organ, one sexuality. Rather, she touches herself all the time because her genitals are formed with two lips that are always in contact. Thus, within herself, she is already two (1985b: 24). When a woman

ization is to say that ``the world appears to me.'' This de¯ates the epis- temic agency of human knowers in a way that is phenomenologically more apt to lived experience: in this appearing to we can be quite passive. We are not always or even often the masters of our epistemic domain, and in this formulation, it is the world that acts, but it acts toward me or in my direction. Thus, the ``appearing to'' language connotes a relational experience; knowledge occurs in an interaction, which is not well repre- sented either as a constituting act nor as a spectatorial exercise. Such a realism seems more realistic. Let me return to the problem of relativism, which remains for even a realist account if it holds to ontological pluralism. Paradoxically, Putnam, borrowing a familiar argument from Nelson Goodman, argues that we can avoid an ``unbridled relativism'' when we come to understand that th…

To the extent that Lacan is concerned with the displacement of subjectivity in the symbolic order of language and culture ± as when he writes of ``the incessant sliding of the signi®ed under the signi®er'' (Lacan 1977: 154) ± Lacan moves well beyond the Enlightenment concerns of Freud. Indeed, his work provides a foundation for poststructuralist accounts of the mani- festation of unconscious fantasy in ideology. Thus for Slavoj Zizek (1988), the desires and fantasies that were once thought to be the private purview of the individual subject are actually experienced and subverted at the level of social and cultural ideology. Selfhood exists not in private spheres, but in ideological discourse. In contrast to the relational perspective, the Lacanian and post-Lacanian account of personal experience is de®ned by lack, emptiness, and depletion. Indeed, as the chapters in this book suggest, there remains a considerable gap between the work of American postmodern relational analysts and the

At the same time her work is exceptionally open to male writers (such as Joyce or Genet) and political figures (such as Mandela) in whom she can sense a feminine. In, for example, “La Venue a l’éeriture” she (a writer, and therefore a reader) is alternately mother, child, lover, beloved, giving and receiving sustenance in an abundance of fantasmatic relationships which do seem before or beyond any stable economy of sexual opposition, and which she terms “feminine.” Two: The Gift Given Time is also highly intertextual with respect to Derrida’s own oeuvre, obsessively auto-erotically footnoted—revealed to HÉLÈNE CIXOUS AND JACQUES DERRIDA 127

It is at once a comment on the constructive principles of the text and a powerful political allegory. Benjamin’s text is built up of a kind of detritus, that which has been overlooked or misused.

At this stage there is no subject/object, and we cannot speak of an order either. But there are processes that have rhythm, and they follow a sort of regulation due to the biological and social constraints mediated by the mother’s body. Most of Kristeva’s theory deals with the relations between semi- otic and symbolic in poetic production, which we can set aside except for those parts emphasizing the importance of the semiotic not only for the acquisition but also for the actual life of language. But always from within the symbolic: in fact, the semiotic is practically contained in the symbolic and mediated by it. And for this reason, it is not directly accessible to us.

first imputed to her. In contrast, Cherniavsky suggests that contemporary retrench­ ments of public reason may indeed have created a shift in subaltern status, but this movement still does not render subaltern agency legible within the spaces of the political. If Cherniavksy attempts to redirect our attention to theoretical insights that she suggests we forget at our political and intellectual peril, Simon Gikandi argues instead that the representational stances of postcolonial theory, in particular its rejection of mimesis, had unfortunate effects on the construction of both the archive and the methodology of postcolonial literary theory. Not only did ‘the relentless critique of the referential function of language’ tend to direct attention to certain novels - ‘as if postcolonial literature began with Salman Rushdie’ - but it also produced readings invested in demonstrating t…

Contemporary Masculinities in Fiction, Film and Television 12 proposes not a rupture between a modern and a postmodern visuality, but instead an ‘ epistemological tear along the fabric of modernity, a change produced by the increasing cultural centrality of an integral feature of both cinematic and televisual apparatuses: a mobilized “ virtual ” gaze ’ (Friedberg 1993: 2). Th e distinction Friedberg makes between the mobilized gaze and the mobilized ‘ visual ’ gaze is organized around the central term of cinema. Th e mobilized gaze is produced by ‘ cultural activities that involve walking and travel ’ (Friedberg 1993: 2), such as fl â nerie ; tourism; mobility created by trains, bicycles, steamships, elevators, automobiles, airplanes; and cultural sites such as exhibition halls, winter gardens, arcades, department stores and museums. Th e gaze is mobilized because the …

uncanny and hauntology are understandably very much concerned with how the past determines the life of a subject in the present. Such struc­ tures will also be part of what follows below, but there will in addition be other aspects of hauntology that are analysed. In the broadest possible terms, the focus will be on limitrophic phenomena that disturb any attempt at mapping out some kind of stable and intelligible ontology. Another important connection between hauntology and the uncanny introduces the next section below. It is of course impossible to avoid the deconstructive aspects of hauntology, since after all, it is a Derridean con­ cept, which really does not invent gothic hauntology, but it concentrates the attention to how literary texts—or perhaps even all texts—seem to work in relation to semantic ghosts and temporality as related to struc­ tures or fluxes of meaning.

the Mourning Diary. The ‘most quoted book in the photographic canon’ is not quite what it once was; an aspect of the afterlives of Roland Barthes has unearthed new elements, new vistas.15 Chapter 4 considers the way in which Barthes’s body of work is covered with what might be called ‘ink blots’, by which I mean points at which an obsession with the materials and materiality of writing leaves its mark. Tracing Barthes’s ‘almost obsessive relation to writing instruments’ and interest in the material act of inscription, I relate the ink blots to the development of a non-­arrogant, non-­expressive, non-­idealistic theory of language in The Neutral and related posthumous texts (such as The Preparation of the Novel and ‘Variations sur l’écriture’). My argument here is that this understanding of language had long been present in the post-Saussurean work of Roland Barthes, but that its precise nature only became apparent in the light of the posthumous publications.

Indeed, she has explicitly argued that strong postmodernism threatens the entire identity of feminism as a politics and tries to discredit the emancipatory ideals which have guided it in the past. Whilst recommending a contextualist theory of knowledge or understanding, she nevertheless insists on the need to sustain a commitment to Enlightenment models of rationality as a regulative principle guiding our enquiries and beliefs. She argues for the need also to continue to envisage the possibility of Utopia (and therefore progress) as an inspiration for political practice and has put forward a persuasive case that social critics cannot afford to abandon the philosophical ideal of 'objectivity', for we need to able to detach ourselves …

Stiegler refers to tertiary form as a ‘third memory’, an ‘epiphylogenesis, in which memory is housed outside of the body through the organization of the inorganic; a tool, a system of writing (or speaking), a technical trace’ (2011: 206). So, if we think of ﬁlm as ‘the digitized temporal audiovisual object’, its sound- images function as a technics of our memory, supplementing it, redirect- ing it, and changing it (2011: 211). The salient part of Stiegler’s theory is something that ﬁlmmakers already know: ‘the possible is a modality of the real’, because all technosciences that organise the life and experiences of a body are outside of that body, as they are constituted through an exteri- orised convergence of industrial products (see 2011: 206–10).

As did Plato, Lacan created, revised and abandoned numerous ideas throughout his contro- versial career. Lacan is difficult and my understanding of him comes largely from reading works on Lacan and from literary critics who em- ploy Lacan’s approaches, and my use of him is synthetic.3 Finally, at least in the USA, psychoanalysis remains in considerably bad odor, even within psychology departments. What Does the Lover Really Love, Anyway? To begin with, Lacan clearly distinguishes a need, like the need for drink, food or even sex, items which can be satisfied, from Desire, which cannot.4 Lacan suggested that Desire’s true goal is an imagined, primordial (but impossible) full personal wholeness and non-contingent being. In the formation of Desire and of the need for some Oth…

the Symbolic except as he becomes the "maternal father." (1987, 45) Yet, Kristeva's postulation of the heterogeneity of language, with its strong maternal element, seems to turn language into a type of maternal father. Kristeva's theory of melancholia and depression goes even further than traditional psychoanalytic theory in analyzing the loss of the mother/land. The melancholic mourns the loss of the maternal "Thing" that, although always lurking, can never be fully recovered in language. Kristeva claims that the melancholic buries this "Thing" below language and then cannot recover it. It could be argued that this is precisely what Kristeva does by proposing the existence of the semiotic "Thing." She buries the semiotic below language and then maintains that it can never be fully recovered. In fact, she suggests (and rejects) this reading of her postulation of the "Thing":

Hauntology was the term that Fisher and a few other music critics adopted/adapted (a blue note difference) from Derrida (like his différance that extends the note, deferring, differing) to designate both the mood and the sonic experimentation with the nervous system. The ghosts here, he writes, are not supernatural, but the traumatically Real in the Lacanian sense, having to do also with the link between social anomie and psycho- pathology, depression, and breakdown, linked in the political economy and individual mental health. He illustrates the traumatic Real with the memory block and double bind in Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film The Shining: killing yourself and family is not the sort of thing you would for- get, and not the sort of thing you could possibly remember (i.e., that

Her ongoing politi- cal involvement has not been limited to queer or feminist issues, however. Butler has also been critical of US involvement in the Iraq War, of events at both Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, as well as intervening in debates on Zionism and on the Palestinian- Israeli conﬂ ict. As such, the caricature of her as the apolitical theorist that some critics draw is clearly ill deserved.

‘method’ even – has been to coin new heterogeneous nouns to see what alternative relations, connections, might be revealed, to embark upon the development of uncommon verbs and prepositions. Consequently, I have reiﬁed strange nouns in order to ‘ﬂuidify’ relations and prepositions. It would seem, then, that reiﬁcation does have its uses (see below). But, at the same time, we must be careful that such reiﬁcation has not produced stories that are too neat, too secure, too ‘impositional’, that, in sum, end up occluding the ﬂuidity of co(a)gents (cf. Law, 1994, 1999) that is supposed to be revealed. Of course, this sensitivity to the interwovenness of reiﬁcation and ﬂuidity echoes others’ work, most notably the partial distinctions drawn between root and rhizome, and territorialization and deterritorialization by Deleuze and Guattari (1983, 1988; see also Latour, 1999b; Lee and Brown, 1994; Wise, 1997).

The important La Rochefoucauldian insight, that love is deﬁned and possibly even created through language, does not yield the unsentimental conclusion that love itself is language, nothing but discourse, nothing but signs. And so I offer a brief reply, in the spirit though not the letter nor the language of Barthes’s very personal text.

actors and their properties” (1993b, 263). How this network of “distributed agency” that involves human and non­ human “actants” can actually function and communicate its collective en­ ergies is especially fascinating to Latour, who responds by calling for a new philosophy of reference. We might consider the example of forensic inves­ tigation mentioned earlier as a good illustration of this network’s prag­ matic interplay because it has the capacity to produce nodes of reference, or evidence, that effectively correspond. Latour underlines that the result­ ing dispositif is not a purely human achievement, and he captures the exquisite mystery of its communicative conversions in the simple question —“How do we pack the world into words?” (1999, 24) The question’s disarming challenge is powerfully evoked in “Circulating Reference: Sampling the Soil in the Amazon Forest” (1999), an es…

Negative logic allows us to speculate about what is not in this world or, conversely, what is in this world but cannot be readily seen, and in these ways the “labor of the negative,” as Benjamin Noys calls it, holds a productive quality.2 An interconnection of apophatic discourse, philosophical fragments, and the horrors of individuation distinguishes the work of Ligotti, Ba- taille, and Cioran. Thus, for the purposes of this book, these three authors are gathered among one another utilizing a tripartite rubric: a) philo- sophical pessimism, b) derivation or deviation from traditional mysti- cism, and c) a direct engagement with or indirect relation to modern horror fiction.

He incorporates the representation in Psyche’s dance of the entire process of Daphne’s metamorphosis into a tree in Ovid, describing how her feet change into sluggish roots and her powerless attempts to resist the transformation with her arms. This latter comment by Agathon is again a misunderstanding that Wieland attributes to his character, since Ovid’s Daphne specifically requests the transformation from Peneus. She does not wish to resist at all, though Agathon might be suggesting second

Here, translation (and reading as translation) involves forms of proximity to the other. Getting closer to the other’s text does not constitute the merging of one with the other. The idea of translation simply as proximity to the other, implies that in engagement (or mutuality) the subject and the other merge, becoming one. While the line between the translator and the text becomes unstable in proximity, it also constitutes the limits of translation and the violence of the difference that cannot simply move across. Hence, in the context of Spivak’s work, translation and reading as forms of engagement do not involve the rendering present of the subaltern woman. Rather, there is something which does not get across, something which is necessarily secret. It is the ‘secret’ that constitutes the ethical dimension of Spivak’s work. Ethics becomes for Spivak, ‘the experience of the impossible’.…

14 Philosophy of the Medium Chapter 5 centres on Michel Serres’s series of five volumes, called Hermès (plus his work on the parasite and on angels as messengers). Only a selection of chapters from the Hermès series has been translated into English. Serres’s books in the Hermès series were published between 1968 and 1980 (Serres 1968; 1972; 1974; 1977; 1980), so embraced all of the 1970s, the period when the theory of the medium as the message was taking root. Serres’s approach notably shows the influence of the mathematical theory of communication, initially developed by Claude Shannon (see Shannon [1949] 1998: 29–125). This explains why Serres’s underlying approach to communication is animated by the notion of the presence or absence of ‘noise in a channel’ (cf. the parasite (Serres 1983)) and by the relation between order and disorder. That is, the medium will be what is not present. ‘Noise’, by contrast, is the

It is precisely this ontological dimen- sion, in which the literary status of the work engages the existential relation to language, that is omitted by more far-reaching formal experiments in the various kinds of modernist poetry that have emerged in the tradition of Pound, Apollinaire, and Stein.

Susan Sontag called the Barthes form of writing in Mythologies ‘essay-epiphanies’6 and this phrase neatly recognizes the dilemma in his work: is the analysis of sign-systems a political, scientiﬁc or aesthetic gesture? To answer this question – and to ponder Barthes’ resistance to such a question – involves an over- view of his work. Barthes’ ﬁrst major publication, Writing Degree Zero (1953), attempts to get beyond an account of literature that focuses merely on the divi- sion of content and form, aware nonetheless of language as a limit or a horizon. Barthes posits two literary axes: the horizontal dispersal of speech, and the vertical ‘depth model’ of individual style; in-between these two axes there is the production of writing or écriture. Barthes

that is always locatable within human relations of recognition of the other, of ethical relations, yet is always also impermanent, mobile, and contingent. By employing the Muselman as the ground through which the emergence of biosovereignty and Homo sacer become apparent, Agamben reproduces the Muselman as her- or himself nothing more than Homo sacer. Andrew Norris notes that Agamben follows Jean-Luc Nancy ‘‘in attempting to ‘think’ community without unity,’’16 a process Caldwell traces as Agamben’s development of ‘‘whatever being,’’ which is ‘‘a-metaphysical’’ and operates completely outside the traditions of sovereignty, as it ‘‘lacks the features permitting the sovereign capture and regulation of life in our tradition.’’17 Unfortunately, compelling as such a theoretical concept is, it seems completely unworkable when asked to address the very material issues of violence that both huma…

1 Introduction Ian James A newcomer to Catherine Malabou’s philosophical writings might find them- selves a little daunted by the scope, range and interdisciplinary breadth of her engagements. Given this, they might also find it a challenge to situate her thinking or to categorise it within the well-established traditions of so-called ‘continental’ philosophy or ‘French theory’. On the one hand, she clearly works in the wake of Derridean deconstruction and also offers landmark read- ings and reformulations of Kantian, Hegelian and Heideggerian philosophy. Her writing can therefore most obviously be situated within the legacy of tran- scendental, phenomenological and post-phenomenological thought. On the other hand, her work brings together diverse and at times seemingly incom- patible contexts. Engagements with neurology, neuroscience and cognitive psychology sit alongside discuss…

PhLL: Yes. It is very coherent. PP: Why, in the context of The Writing of the Disaster, is there a need to make this apparent, particularly in light of the question of sovereignty, which, for Blanchot, is “nothing”? After all, it is a book that produces a physical effect. In the composition of the text, there is something that tilts the primal scene toward the nothing [le rien], the outside [le dehors], toward the writing of the disaster itself. PhLL: Which is why I say that The Writing of the Disaster revolves in a sense around that text. Especially because, in my view (though perhaps I’m wrong), the question mark casts doubt precisely over the sovereignty of the author, who says: “I, Maurice Blanchot, even though I’m expressing myself in the third person, etc.” All the same, it is a text that can only be read self- referentially, which still implies a kind of sovereignty of writing: the writer as sovereign. All of which he will attempt to destroy right to the end.

What might Good have seen in Brian’s transcript if he had been a different kind of listener, or if he were writing in a genre other than the academic article? Consider the distinction between a language that names pain—which is what Scarry, Jackson, and Good look for—and Brian’s narrative of a life in pain. Good describes the narrative as “a remarkable story of a life of pain—a pain with an incredible origin myth” (29), but he also says that Brian’s representation of pain is “inadequate to express the sentient quality of his suffering” (29, 35). Brian’s own sense of why he fails to communicate is markedly different. He sees lan- guage failing him because his words are consistently met by disbelief and in-

tions of ethics need to be broadened. To be sure, humanism as an ideological movement has brought forth a set of values whose importance cannot be overestimated. My focus here is on the metaphysics of humanism, which is rooted in modernism, and its radical separation of the human subject and nonhuman objects. Analyzing the metaphysical basis of mainstream ethics will make room for an alternative approach that is needed to think about, assess, and help shape the moral relevance of technological artifacts. In their modernity critiques, authors like Latour (1993) and Heidegger ([1947] 1976; 1977a) elaborated the thesis that this rigid separation makes it virtually impossible to see the many ways in which subjects and objects are actually interwoven. And taking into account this interwoven character is crucial to understanding our technological culture, in which human deci- sions and practices are increasingly shaped in interaction with technologies.

My particular Archimedean point, however, is not in the real transcultural body but rather in the space between it and its representations. I hold up the history of progress in reproductive physiology-the discovery of distinct germ products, fcr example-to demonstrate that these did not cause a partic- ular understanding of sexual difference, the shift to the two-sex model. But I also suggest that theories of sexual difference influenced the course of scientific progress and the interpretation of particular experimental re- sults.

I follow this with an investigation of women’s writing on the mother, focusing on the possibility or desirability of theorising the real mother in the work of Hélène Cixous, Melanie Klein, Julia Kristeva, Iris Marion Young, Adrienne Rich and Luce Irigaray. In this chapter I allude to an ambiguity in Kristeva’s work by indicating the moments where she focuses on the sensuous, embodied processes of pregnancy and motherhood over and against the maternal as metaphor. I conclude with a discussion of what I call Irigaray’s labial logic, suggesting that her bilabial trope manages to displace the dichotomous relations between reference and metaphor, self and other, speaking and silence. I argue that her labial logic shifts us away from a concern with the symbolic as the speaking position toward a discussion of the difference that…

Introduction — xxi of his ideas about the movement of time, an image is "a certain existence which is more than that which the idealist calls representation, but less than that which the real- ist calls a thing—an existence placed halfway between the 'thing' and 'representation'" (Matter and Memory, 9). As Bergson indicates, the image being "halfway between thing and representation" is what gives cinema the complex layered quality as some- thing that indexically simulates the visible world and also has the potential to open beyond itself. These films work to place images into the flow of time and thus are dynamic. Each film is at once static object and ephemeral force in the continuously transforming ways they make meaning. And so these films are not so much represen- tations of history as they are the stuff of history.2 The Writing of History My central argument in this study starts f…

41 4 Vision in the Flesh The texture of phenomenological light Merleau-Ponty’s account of the primacy of perception includes a chiasmic reformulation of light that disrupts the dichotomous logic of the visible and the invisible upon which metaphysical thought is based. Light’s essence in the experiencing of visual phenomena is rendered ambiguous by Merleau-Ponty’s proposition of the corporeality of all conscious experience. In place of a distinction between the visible (sensible experience or perception) and the invisible (intelligible laws or thought), Merleau-Ponty gives an account of the embodied nature of both visible and invisible light. The fantasy of intelligible light is that it exists in its own terms independently of any material assistance and requires no organ of sight. By way of contrast Merleau-Ponty insists that the light of conscious illumination and reflection cannot…

women have played only a marginal part, a search for theory cannot overlook the kind of questioning and confrontations that underlie other radical aesthetic movements. I want to mention only two aspects of relations between semiotics and the avant-garde, both affecting women. Julia Kristeva in her work on modernist poetics has built a connection between the crisis that produced the language of modernism and 'the feminine'.10 She sees femininity as the repressed in the patriarchal order and as standing in a problematic relation to it. Tradition is trans- gressed by an eruption of linguistic excess, involving pleasure and 'the feminine' directly opposed to the logical language and repression endemic to patriarchy. A problem remains: woman, in these terms, only stands for what has been repressed, and it is the male poet's relation

As important to discussions of monsters as Freud’s idea of the uncanny is Julia Kristeva’s concept of abjection, which refers to the process through which the self separates itself from the nonself, and the repulsion elicited by that which was once a part of the self but no longer is. Accordingly, Kristeva’s discussion of abjection from her The Powers of Horror is included here. Robin Wood and Noël Carroll follow, presenting more gen- eral psychoanalytic approaches to monsters. Wood, in “An Introduction to the American Horror Film,” focuses in particular on repression, arguing that mon- sters in horror films reflect the “return of the repressed”; that is, they give shape to what a particular culture fears and desires.

As she says, for example, in her essay “Divine Women,” 33 See, for instance, her claim at the beginning of An Ethics of Sexual Difference: “Sexual Difference would constitute the horizon of worlds more fecund than any known to date— at least in the West—and without reducing fecundity to the reproduction of bodies and flesh.

or even to inter-uterine existence. Julia Kristeva, amongst others, has developed Freud's thesis of the 'hidden' body around the concept of 'abjection'. Kristeva's highly complex (and often obscure) musings concentrate on the fear of the 'archaic' mother and the nature of defilement (excremental and 'menstrual'), the mechanisms of symbolic rejection and the borderlines of taboo. Such abjection has religious and sacred undertones but its symbolism is still tied to evolutionist and biologist presuppositions. Such theories (in all their sophistication and complexity) are essentially narcissistic (that which brings horror is that which we love, i.e. ourselves!) and are opposed by notions that horror is the result of a confrontation with the absolutely unknown, something much closer to demonic and folk explanations. That many modern critics see only the possible erotic (and therefore psycho-sexual) elements in Dracula is a reduction which diminishes

cinema offers specific and numerous examples of the movement-­image. To be clear, Deleuze acknowledges that Bergson was not studying cinema itself, and so has to work hard to connect up his own ideas about the status of the image in cinema with Bergson’s formulations. However, as we will argue, Deleuze would have been well advised to bypass the cinematic image as used by Bergson and to move more directly to his more potent concept of durée. In other words, unlike Deleuze, we will avoid the illustration and instead focus on the process. That said, what Deleuze does take successfully from Bergson is his taxonomy of image: the perception-­image, the affection-­image and the action-­image. In Bergson’s formulation, it is perceptions that cause affects, which in turn lead to actions. For Deleuze this illuminates the movement-­image of the cinema. In practice, what intervenes between affect and action is

Noise directs us away form the message itself toward the medium in which it is given. Like Deleuze’s idea, which we encountered earlier, that the world is the remainder, left over after our equations have linked its diversity into sets and resembelances, here in Serres’ philosophy of communication, noise is the ‘third man’, always on the perimeter of any circuit of senders and receivers. In order to communicate, sender and receiver have to battle with the clamor of the milieu. No matter how opposed the terms of their debate, they proceed on the understanding that they can minimize the threat of noise and control the environment in which they transfer messages.

When, in Seminar VII, “pure” desire is explicitly posited as “tragic” desire, Lacan is obliged to reassess his implicit identiﬁcation of “normal” and “pure” desire. From this point on, the for- mer will always be associated more openly with neurotic desire, and the neurotic subject will be normalized. With these speciﬁcations in mind, Part I of this book focuses on the subject of the Imaginary, and provides a precise account of the way in which the ego comes to be deﬁned as an imaginary function by Lacan. The ego corresponds to the subject’s identifying alienation in the imaginary other and, given its narcissistic-specular nature, should not be confused with the subject of the unconscious.

reader at large, feminism has long seen its own project as intimately connected to the body, and has responded to the masculinist convention by producing a variety of oftimes incompatible theories which attempt to take the body into account. For some, the materiality of the body, and particularly in its female form, comes to the fore only to be once more bracketed out of consideration, but what is different between this and dominant malestream approaches is that rather than a thoroughgoing disregard for things corporeal, feminism starts at least from a position of acknowledgement. More positively, other feminist writers have developed theory that is explicitly embodied and insistent on the centrality of the material body; while yet others, influenced by poststructur­ alism and postmodernism in particular, have put into question the giveness and security of the so-called natural…

The diversiﬁcation and expan- sion of feminist philosophies, fuelled by a brand new generation of post- postfeminists, is both supported by and productive of a signiﬁcant growth of institutional practices, some of which happen outside the strict conﬁnes of academic philosophy, mostly in new trans-disciplinary areas like gender, race and postcolonial studies, social theories of globalization and migration, and philosophies of new media and biotechnology.

184 I Achille Mbembe Such is the logic of heroism as classically understood: to execute others while holding one's own death at a distance. In the logic of martyrdom, a new semiosis of killing emerges. It is not nec­ essarily based on a relationship between form and matter. As I have already indicated, the body here becomes the very uniform of the martyr. But the body as such is not only an object to protect against danger and death. The body in itself has neither power nor value. The power and value of the body result from a process of abstraction based on the desire for eternity. In that sense, the mar­ tyr, having established a moment of supremacy in which the subject over­ comes his own mortality, can be seen as laboring under the sign of the future. In other words, in death the future is collapsed into the present. In its desire for eternity, the besieged body passes throug…

(L423/​S680) Pascal invites us to clarify the love-​values that animate the deep roots of our being; this is an ethical process. Our rational motivation to act has reasons that only the heart knows; its lock is often buried in that deep soil of our being. Connecting to it is an act of care—​of love—​that we owe to ourselves and others. For this reason, as we saw from our brief exploration of utilitarian, deonto­ logical, and virtue ethics of love, I favor an ethics of love that does not see love as the end goal of one’s actions. I want to avoid turning the recipients of love into disposable tools. I discuss the deontological proposal for an ethics of love that emerges in Kant and Kierkegaard as a formal guiding principle that can point our choices in the right direction. However, it cannot help us in resolving personal love conflicts or help us to build a loving moral character. …

Deleuze’s second volume is especially useful for deﬁning the exemplarity of French ﬁlm and audiovisual cul- ture since 1958. However, I also want to make a larger argument con- cerning the nature of Deleuze’s philosophical analysis. The transition described from The Movement-Image to The Time-Image also eﬀects a more general displacement in the philosophy of history, indeed a shift- ing relation between history and thought marked by confrontations in the postwar episteme between existentialism—with its Hegelian con- ception of history and politics—and the poststructuralism of Deleuze and Foucault, with their Nietzschean and genealogical concepts of his- tory and thought. This new historical sense equally informs the recon- sideration of time and change in contemporary French visual culture.

It was clear that the transition intimidated Barthes, particularly insofar as it happened at the same time as the ill- ness and subsequent death of his mother, with whom he had lived to- gether his entire life. Traces of his mourning and his doubts can be found in the notes that sometimes seem rather flat and uninspired, es- pecially in comparison with the rest of Barthes’ work. And yet the four years in which Barthes taught at the Collège de France are still worthy of attention, and for three reasons: First, because they show how the respective fantasies that Barthes chose each year as starting point for his lectures can be traced retroactively to Barthes’ earlier work, shining a new light on that ear- lier work. This is also nicely illustrates Barthes’ own proposition that every bit of reading, regardless how objective it seems to be, is deter-

Through her guidance, I may come to “see” how the image is beautiful in her eyes. While I may not fully change my own opinion of the photograph, its appearance of beauty to another becomes intelligible. Can the same be said of the sublime? To return to Mariel’s account: when mother and daughter ﬁrst sit in front of the blue painting both Mariel and Erin agree upon its pleasantness and its ability to stir them. They agree it is (more or less) beautiful. This mutual recognition, however, changes when the painting becomes sublime for Mariel. Whereas Mariel experiences the sublime, her daughter ostensibly does not. Even when Mariel describes why this painting is sublime, another viewer (perhaps a reader of this text w…

Rather than the avatar and gamer as a “being”, they also quantify a “doing” in this context, and it is through our specific entanglements that we are re-stabilised (given our particular “individuality”) through what we can do. For example, the gamer can take certain actions as can the avatar, and the avatar-gamer subjectivity emerges from those actions, yet the actions themselves create a performative boundary. In the chapters on articulating, acting, empathy, subject formation, and endings, this “doing”, this destabilising and restabilising, is evident as a constant process: a renegotiation of subject positions that operates through a continual ebb and flow. Whilst the chapters demonstrate that this isn’t always easy, pleasurable or fun, the entanglement enacts a specific agency, a way to intervene. This rejects

Introduction 3 triggered renewed interest in the field of ghosts and specters.10 Hauntology is the dark double of ontology. It deconstructs and empties out ontology, being and presence. Neither alive nor dead, the Derridean specter hovers between presence and absence, making it impossible to assign definite meanings to things. For, as Ruth Parkins-Gounelas explains, haunting and spectrality have to do with “the untimeliness/ anachrony which, to use Derrida’s words, put to rout our meaning- to-say.”11 It is in the nature of ghosts to stand in defiance of the binary oppositions (life or death, inside or outside as well as present or past) that constitute our symbolic system, and as such they are intimately linked with deconstruction. Spectrality then concerns just as much the present as the past: it is “what makes the present waver.”12 In Nicholas Royle’s analysis, it is what is…

structuralist feminism thus argues that it can never be enough to say,“I am (a) woman,”since gender has no more a totalizing claim on identity than any other attribute.This line of argument found its most acute articulation in Judith Butler’s Gender Trouble, in which Butler argues that gender identity, rather than being essential to the self, is always the result of iterated, socially sanctioned performances.15Whether,as Butler argues,gender accrues to the body through acts,or whether one locates the function of gender elsewhere outside the self—in ideology, the Law, the unconscious, historical contexts, etc.16—the important point for poststructuralist feminist critics is that the category of “woman” is split by the discursive, historical, and contextual speciﬁcities of difference. In this sense, both poststructuralism and the cri- tiques of white feminism by feminists of color have shown that we can’t say “we” without a self-consciousness attentive to the essentializing and exclu-

as a ‘follower’ of the late Derrida. Malabou puts forward ways of thinking about the process of deconstruction that have helped to reconceptualize Derrida’s very own project. If one were permitted to identify a single vector of this reworking, it would have to be her attempt to radicalize the very idea of différance – and to come up with what is now called a hyper- deconstruction. In her four books to date, she indeed offers a way of rethinking the abyss of deconstruction, not in an attempt to surpass it or get rid of it for that would be impossible, but in a way that does not leave us in an endless free-fall and yet continues the work of de(con)struction of Western metaphysics. Malabou’s main question is perhaps this one: Why did Derrida continually address the issue of the radically other, of that which has absolutely no ground? This crucial question resets in motion the deconstructive…

or as if technology were a feminizing device. After all, a body-​drug cyborg can get out of human control; cyborgs are elements of the dystopia that science fiction has warned us about. Finally, the most interesting findings of this work were the fear of lack of control of female desire. There is hope that a body assisted by technology will influence their sexual partner’s will and behavior and maintain intact their per­ formance of a masculine man: dominant, vigorous, and self-​confident about how to interact sexually. This is evoked by two of the interviewees, who have hidden the fact that they used Viagra or Cialis before the sexual encounter. Potts reflected in her own work that cyborg bodies shape identities and rela­ tionships too, and not always positively. In all the discussed cases, the anticipat­ ed use of Sildenafil and Tadalafil was due to perpetuate the self-​represen…

 The Sadism of the Scopic Regime is by no means a beauty, but in her face there is the flicker of something more than beauty—something sublime. Many of her films are held in high esteem de- spite their insipid plots because they exert the fascination, the glimmer to seduce people into a dream world where they can savor how she looks. (113) This passage recalls Mulvey’s woman-as-fetish theory, in which woman’s visual presence in film “works against the development of a story line, to freeze the flow of action in moments of erotic contemplation” (19). In contrast to suture, Mulvey’s “fetish” puts an end to narrative rather than providing its beginning; it draws the viewer into “overwhelmed disorien- tation” rather than promising relief. Spatially speaking, suturing is based on the anxiety that the gap of castration must be closed, while fetishiza- tion is based on the anxiety that that same gap—necessary for narrative—

and "semicolasm."22 (1971) In this essay, and in many of her other early essays, when she does use "semiotic" it refers to the science of signifying practice (semanalysis), not its heterogeneous element per se. She first fully develops the notion of the semiotic in Revolution in Poetic Language. There she proposes that both psychoanalysis and linguistics need to account for what is heterogeneous to/within signification, the semiotic. The semiotic disposition that makes its way into language is the rhythm, intonation, and echolalias of the mother-child symbiosis. (1976, 157) The semiotic disposition is based on the primal mother-child relationship. It is the rhythms and sounds of their bodies together fused into one. For Kristeva, this is not merely an imaginary union. Rather, at this point, it is also a real union. The child is physically dependent on its union with the mother. The…

Th e use of the word ‘trace’ here is interesting in terms of its relationship to deconstructionism and in turn to existentialism, and it prompts a slight diversion. Hainge oﬀ ers up a mix of Derrida, Deleuze and Whitehead in his attempt to use noise as an organizing principle, as well as a metaphor for wider ontological questions. As such, he is a monist, and his model does not require that the Cartesian dualism be reinstated, as is the…

But, as mentioned at the outset, Levinas’s insights have more often been applied to ﬁlms that are signiﬁcantly less ambivalent about the visual and emerge from different historical, intellectual and cultural contexts. More straightforwardly and directly than Shoah, such ﬁlms call into question Levinas’s critique of what he calls ‘the eternally present order of vision’ as inherently totalizing.40 Viewing ﬁlms with Levinas always involves a degree of viewing against the iconoclastic thrust of his writings. This negotiation is essential if we are to avoid downplaying the speciﬁcity of the medium in the service of an autonomous and in some ways conﬂicting the- oretical agenda. Levinas’s denigration of vision, so intimately bound up with his conception of the ethical, provokes us to look different…

symbolic forces; it is a surface where multiple codes (race, sex, class, age, etc.) are inscribed; it is a cultural construction that capitalizes on energies of ■a heterogeneous, discontinuous and unconscious nature. The body which, for Beauvoir, was one’s primary ‘situation’, in reality is now seen as a situated self, as an embodied positioning of the self. This renewed sense of com plexity aims to stimulate anew a revision and redefinition of contemporary subjectivity. This vision of the body contains sexuality as a process and as a constitutive element. I want to stress the importance of sexuality in feminist thought, where it is perceived critically as the site of power, struggles and contradictions. But it is re-visited creatively precisely because of its crucial importance as a site of constitution of the subject. In other words, the sexed female feminist is both the subject around which feminists have gathered in their recognition

they are not retroactively understood on the basis of the Oedipus complex qua per- manent symbolic structure of the subject. More generally, it is important to note how, despite its marginal thematization in Lacan’s early works, desire clearly con- stitutes the primary force underlying all the subject’s imaginary dialectical move- ments. This is why Lacan speaks of a “see-saw of desire”54 made of successive projections and introjections. 1.4 Consciousness, the Unconscious, and the Complexes One last dialectical movement still awaits explanation in Lacan’s theory of the subject’s imaginary psychic development. It is indeed clear that the subject’s in- trojection of the ego as the primary (alienating) identiﬁcation (Ur-Ich) has to follow—if not chronologically, at least logically—a primordially unconscious projection/representation of the (other’s) body image as such.

Whereas the movement-image of pre-Second World War cinema finds narrative cohesion and chrono- logical organisation through the sensory-motor schema that Bergson identifies of habitual movement and response, the postwar time- image that Deleuze discerns encounters the very splitting or crack of time towards past and future. ‘Time consists of this split, and it is this, it is time’, Deleuze via Bergson contends ‘that we see in the crystal . . . the perpetual foundation of time, non-chronological time, Cronos and not Chronos . . . The visionary, the seer, is the one who sees in the crystal, and what he sees is the gushing of time as dividing in two, as splitting’ (C2: 81).

(It’s in only one’s sixties, I think, that it becomes possible to see the anxiety about appearance that often haunts one’s ﬁfties as a way of displacing—or postponing—the crisis of mortality.Far easier to obsess about the signs of aging—the cosmetics of time’s passage— than reﬂect upon death. Recently, my most intimate friend, my contemporary, and the one with whom for many years my life unfolded in an always complicated dialogue, died at age ﬁfty-eight of a cerebral hemorrhage.We liked to tape our important conver- sations and called ourselves “les parleuses” in honor of Marguerite Duras’s book by that name. Looking at her life from the decade of my sixties, it now seems to me that dying in one’s ﬁfties is dying young. I open this parenthesis still in shock, in grief, and at the very beginning of the memory work that will help me try to make sense of this—her—story, that will help surround the loss with words. But on the edge of the gap I can already tell that the mir-

social and political malaise. On this view, the ontology of pain intervenes in the space of passage between biography, history, and poetics, linking the- matic, modal, and structural effects of the prose poems to the sentient expe- rience of an “author” and of the bodies (those of the laboring poor, the prostitute, the middle-class city dweller, and so on) among which he circu- lates and by which he is deeply inscribed.6 I hope to show that this interpenetration between private body, public body, and urban geography becomes readable, in the prose poems, as a neg- ative version of the famous Baudelairean dialectic of the vaporization and centralization of the self—that is, as a dialectic enacted and ultimately undone by the “pure physical experience of negation” (BP 52). Founding instance and final referent of the text, a historical pain can be seen to proj- ect its disruptive effects thr…

as a fixed biological reality and gender as the social production of mean- ings around sexed differences. Testo Junkie works by way of parallelisms (to borrow from Spinoza),11 where neither ideas nor bodies take prece- dence in the causal circuits of desire and love; or, as Moira Gatens puts it, “a particular extensive organization of bodies will be paralleled by certain intensive powers and capacities”.12 Preciado articulates this theme through a language borrowed from Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari: It’s not a matter of going from woman to man, from man to woman, but of contaminating the molecular bases of the production of sexual difference, with the understanding that these two states of being, male and female, exist only as “political fictions”, as somatic effects of the technical process of nor- malization. It’s a matter of intervening intentionally in this process of pro- duction in order to end up with viable forms of incorporated gender, to

(1991: 4). Here it works also to disavow the technological interventions on which it is dependent, and to reassert the rightness of traditional gendered norms. The final question about Haraway's cyborg figure concerns the utopian qualities attached to its newness. Jennifer Gonzalez has pointed out that the image of the cyborg, though not named as such, dates back at least to the eighteenth century. It is not, she writes, `a simulacrum which signifies only itself', but rather a cultural image which is already saturated in meaning (2000: 59). Cyborg images are evidence of cultural anxieties; they cannot `float above the lingering, clinging past of differences, histories, stories, bodies, places' (2000: 64). Gendered female for the most part, they have also functioned consistently as images of the racially `other', the product of `miscegenation'. The persistence of this image of the ` ``exotic'' and vindictive cyborg who passes . . . as simply human'

deal of philosophical work must be performed to reconstruct it from the impoverished version given todirect experience. The different realist positions that have emerged differ precisely in what they postulate must be speculatively added to what is given to yield a richer picture of things and events. Given how recent this “speculative turn” is, the variety of proposals is a welcome antidote to the premature freezing of a single ontological solution to the problem. In the present text the necessary enrichment of the world-view is performed by adding to the properties that deﬁne an object’s identity, its tendencies and capacities. Whereas properties are always actual, tendencies and capacities can be real without being actual, if they are not currently manifested or exercised. Thus, the mind-independent identity of a given body of water can be established by determining its actual properties (its volume, purity of composition, temperature, speed

To construct one’s identity is a pro cess that can only be a develop- ment of an original biological malleability, a fi rst transformability. If sex were not plastic, there would be no gender. If something were not off ered for transformation in the natural and anatomical determina- tion of sex, then identity construction would not be possible.76 Th is type of deconstructed essence locates within metamorphosis and transformation a form of resistance—with potentialities, Malabou sug- gests, for po liti cal transformation. Malabou has explored the relationship between subjectivity and re- sis tance in other areas as well. In Plasticity at the Dusk of Writing, she has conceptualized her own intellectual autobiography through her encoun- ters with the philosophy of plasticity. “I am just trying to show how a being, in its fragile and fi nite mutability, can experience the materiality of existence and transform its ontological meaning.

grounded, Donna Haraway’s influential ‘A Cyborg Manifesto’ (1985) posits that the ubiquity of technology in Western culture meant we have all become cyborgs, ‘chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism’ (150). Haraway sees this ‘cyborg’ subjectivity as holding the potential to subvert dominant Western ideologies and move beyond familiar binaries of gender, race and class, enabling people to connect in new ways. The capacity of technological augmentation to help people connect is another key dimension of Kazuhiko Nakamura’s image on the cover of this collection: the two cybernetically enhanced figures face each other, ready for dialogue, for communication. Haraway’s argument paved the way for other theorists to explore the politics of embodied identity. New ways of understanding the self have germinated in response to the range of new technologies that influence the way we live. Most of all, as N. Katherine Hayles points out, discussion of the

It all happens independently of me.80 Because motor-intentional activity is called forth by the situation in this way, and is therefore to some degree independent of the autonomous will of the subject, it does not have at its heart the kind of autonomous representational content that a subject could have an attitude toward. This account of motor intentionality gives us the tools that we need to understand Merleau-Ponty’s notion of the “positive indeterminate” in experience. Recall that Merleau-Ponty’s goal was to explain how our experience of the back side of the mug does not merely hypothesize the existence of a handle, but is somehow p…

art and mass culture and their very ubiquity has tended to grant their representations both a certain transparency and a deﬁnite complexity. What Annette Kuhn says of photography applies, with the appropriate adaptations of medium, to ﬁctive narrative today: Representations are productive: photographs, far from merely repro- ducing a pre-existing world, constitute a highly coded discourse which, among other things, constructs whatever is in the image as object of consumption – consumption by looking, as well as often quite literally by purchase. It is no coincidence, therefore, that in many highly socially visible (and proﬁtable) forms of photography women dominate the image. Where photography takes women as its subject representing the postmodern 21

with personal and historical trauma. Here Strawson’s skepticism is help- ful: not all experience can be formulated in narrative form. Further, at traumatic extremes experience can be narrated only through a kind of aesthetic violation. “Transforming is what art does,” Susan Sontag asserts of photography conveying the horrors of war,23 and narrative also in- volves the aesthetic transformation of suffering. Claude Lanzmann has suggested that the drive to tell and make sense of the Shoah is in itself a form of traumatic violation.24 That narrative has limits—should have lim- its—is an ethical issue, one that must be acknowledged, I think, in any book addressing the subject of depression and narrative.25 4 Hilary Clark

carefully culled, and ground these concepts as defining elements of the genre. The moralistic and social skew, crossing between systems of belief that appear anathema to each other on the surface yet coexist in the mind of the audience, and the ‘happening/summoning’ are of particular impor­ tance here in interpreting how the culture deals with the Derridean concept of hauntology. Jacques Derrida’s interpretation of the haunting of the ontologic origin in a post-modern or post-historical society is revealing of the differentiation apparent in medieval literature of the British Isles as well as the modern Folk Horror aesthetic in the ‘unholy trinity’ of films as well as a slew of other itera­ tions (Derrida 1984, 33). The haunting of the present by the forgotten or repressed past, as Jaco Gericke illustrates, depends on both the interdependence of the present and the past as a means to define themselves and the present’s unwillingness to see those relationships even as the past

that reﬂects a period in Cixous’ work in which she was explicitly engaging with issues of sexual difference. Yet what is equally apparent in this text is the over- arching trope of a kind of divine justice that informs her analysis, including her call for women to be liberated from beneath the oppressive constraints of a patri- archal law which has been buttressed by a patriarchal notion of God. It is in the context of this spirit of something like divine justice that Cixous calls upon women to ‘write themselves’, to write the embodied experience of woman, and by what- ever means, to break through the oppression and silence of the patriarchal logos. To write – the act will ‘realise’ the un-censored relationship of woman to her sexuality, to her woman-being giving her back access to her own forces; that will return her goods, her pleasures, her organs, her vast bodily territories kept under seal; that will tear her out

26 2 Film and Philosophy The perception image isolates a certain section from the fleeting flow of cin- ematic images; it enables the separate perception of a portrayed body by creating a framing. The action image results from the perception in a time-delayed reaction. “Just as perception relates movement to ‘bodies’ (nouns), i.e. to fixed objects that serve as carriers of movement or moved, action relates movement to ‘actions’ (verbs) that correspond to a predetermined goal or a presumed result.” (Deleuze [1983] 1989, pp. 95–96) The affect image creates a connection between the cinematic image and the body of the recipient, who, however, cannot react to it (Deleuze [1983] 1989, p. 96). Ultimately, Deleuze goes so far as to consider the self-image of man per se as “nothing more than an arrangement of these three images, a fusion of perception image, action image, and affect ima…

advancements, and environmental changes, it is also informed by the insights of affect theorists who have identified affects as spontaneous, disruptive, instantaneous atoms of feeling embedded in social and politi- cal structures. This merger of historical methodologies and affect theory offers a fruitful analytical framework for elucidating historically specific incarnations of affects while reframing historical narratives by telling a story through the lens of affect. Affect theorists have drawn attention to the importance of analytical precision in addressing feelings that range from the atomic particles of an immediate instantaneous feeling such as instincts and sensations to more organized structural molecular forms of feeling such as emotional states of love, sadness, or happiness that can involve a conglomeration of affective components. Moreover, affect theorists have …

able, the unanticipatable, the non-identifiable, in short, as that of which one does not yet have a memory” (18). It is easy to see in The Other Heading how much Derrida’s own recent work anticipates the question of narrative after deconstruction. In asking how the new Europe can be both part of a cultural tradition and “unanticipatable,” Derrida invokes the question suspended within the title of this book: how can narrative come out of and also break from deconstruction? The mechanism of this complex temporality is more explicit within another of Derrida’s recent books, Archive Fever (1995). Like The Other Heading, this book examines the relationship viii . Preface

which is misinterpreted by the brain as pain. However, research and treatments for these theories are unverifiable. Herta Flor is concerned with the link between memory and bodily loss. She suggests that since phantom pain may resemble the pain that occurred before a limb was amputated, “pain memories established prior to the amputation are powerful elicitors of phantom limb pain” (Flor 2002, 877). Though phantom pain usually resembles pre-­amputation pain, Flor explains that her theory remains inconclusive, partially due to the influence of the psychical upon the physical. She concludes that “more longitudinal research is needed to test the pain memory hypothesis” (Flor 2006, 878). Ramachandran’s research on PLS focuses on the neurological reaction to the trauma of an amputated limb. He theorises that a map of the body exists in the brain, which is suddenly mismatched when a…

transformation emerges as both a constant and an urgent feminist priority. Such reassessment also involves reconsidering the status of feminism’s own narratives of transformation. The espousal of feminism involves a belief in the possibility of a better future, if not in utopia.5 Yet such a belief requires a ques- tioning of our understanding of history, not only through a questioning of who or what should be the subjects of and for history, but also through a rethinking of how we, as feminists, relate to the past. Thus feminist projects involve the process of re-membering themselves in order to understand how aspects of the past may enter into the future without either destructive repetition or denial of those features of the past which such projects might be designed to leave behind. This re-membering involves challenging the terms not only of ‘progress’ but also of inheritance and evolution, of nostalgia and of sentiment. It means paying

Hermansson explains this unsettling effect by pointing out that ‘the nature of the secret is textual, as is the nature of the breaches of conﬁ nement and the monstrous replication of the story once it has burst its textual enclosure’ (101). By using the Lacanian notion of discursive registers as an aid, I explore how the nar- rative and discursive organization of Jane’s autobiography affects our understanding of ‘Bluebeard.’ I analyse Jane’s retrospective narrative by paying attention to its motivation and its ﬂ uctuation between narrative coherence and any phantom texts revealing the inconsistencies of symbolic representa- tion.3 The balanced elegance of Jane’s narration catches attention.

In the chapter ‘Barthes’ Punctum’ Fried reads Camera Lucida as an anti-theatrical tract. His inter- pretation turns on the manner in which Barthes ties the phenomenology of photographic affect to the rejec- tion of different modes of intentionality. Famously, the punctum is a relational concept that finds its locus, initially at least, in those striking elements of a photograph that might interrupt its conventional use. Such extraneous details are sneaked into the image by the camera despite, and not because of, the intent of the photographer, and there they stand, for Barthes, as

For example, human-animal studies, medical humanities, and environ- mental or ecological humanities (Squier 2004; Alaimo 2011; Rose et al. 2012; Rose 2015), as well as new media and digital humanities (as presented by Holloway- Attaway in this volume), have all generated new forms of posthumanities. They may thus engender feminist cultural studies with a transbiological twist or ecologically embedded ethics (Alaimo 2008). They may encompass human-animal perspectives in technoscience, marine life in musicology, or the ethnography of southern women’s stitching technologies. In all cases feminist posthumanities means reaching out, becoming (k)nomadic (Cieleme˛cka 2015), and composing with others a missing population, standing like modest witnesses on the shoulders of giants, aiming to become accountable companions to troubled and rich intellectual heritages. It also involves cri…

to his needs.” Laying the foundations for a thorough critique of Freudo-Marxism, he then indicates that this communist-utopian aspiration fails to take into account structures revealed by psychoanalysis in its treatment of the libidinal economy and subject formation. These structures (speciﬁcally those delineated by Lacan in terms of his need-demand-desire triad) purportedly render any such utopia a literal no-place, an unattainable fantasy-ideal.32 A couple of years later, in the seventh seminar, Lacan further develops this line of critical reﬂection, calling utopia a “dream world” that overlooks “the distance that exists between the organization of desires and the organization of needs,” a distance said to be quite familiar to those steeped in the clinical practice of analysis.33 Arguably, Freudo-Marxists of the Frankfurt School neglect precisely this gap separating desire from need — this neglect stems from an inadequate appreciation of

Yet the mirror holds the promise of transcendence. It reveals to us our potential to move beyond ourselves and to become something else. Lacan calls it a quasi-transcendental effect of the mirror; he suggests that the mirror’s promise is at once encroached by the windfall of possibility yet plagued by its inevitable implausibility. Certainly, the self is recognized in an initial moment of Gestalt, but it is also a fictional coordinate by virtue of the fact that the self is subject to a limited number of representations; there is only room in the imaginary for so many selves. Thus, according to Lacan (2006 [1949]: 4): The mirror stage is a drama whose internal thrust is precipitated from insuf- ficiency to anticipation—and which manufactures for the subject, caught up in the lure of spatial identification, the succession of phantasies that extends from a fragmented body-image to…

The corporeal and investigative spectatorship associated with installa- tions made by artists like Rist, Piccinini, and Mori arguably intersects with a wide range of feminist critical approaches. Of course numerous difﬁcul- ties are associated with periodizing and identifying feminism in art with regard to the multiplicity of feminisms since the 1970s — including genera- tional and regional divergences, feminist critiques centered on race and class, and so- called postfeminisms. My goal in this book is not to demar- cate deﬁnitively what constitutes an authentic feminist art; rather, my aim is to explore how expansive the intellectual inheritance of feminism(s) can be for theorizing contemporary artistic production and its methods.

the same aspects of deferred meaning and absence-presence as other, earlier figures of deconstruction like the trace and the hymen, thus subsuming it to a wider theoretical framework, this volume aims to put the ghost center stage. If Derrida incites us to learn to live with the ghost, we go beyond this by exploring how we live with it already, using concrete examples of ghostly appearances and haunting scenarios. In the contributions to this volume, the ghost or specter is traced through many objects and disciplines, yet each contributor takes care to delineate the way they are using the concept and how they are supplementing or specifying Introduction

in terms that echo Ruskin’s notion of every day and indeed every moment as a day of judgment, in particular for the Jews, prohibited from investigating the future, but for whom nevertheless ‘every second of time was the straight gate through which the Messiah might enter’(266). In a sense Benjamin is a mirror image of Ruskin. Against Ruskin’s attempts to save art for God Benjamin proclaims the end of the aura of the work of art, an end bound up with technical reproducibility. It is perhaps simply that Benjamin celebrates what Ruskin has intuited, that mechanical reproduction techniques have a close relationship with the Death of God, and the triumph of nihilism, not least because they engage with contingency and time (Ruskin, though some twenty-five years older than Nietzsche, died in the same year, 1900. Both also had succumbed to mental illness almost completely by 1889). At the same time Ruskin also perhaps intuited something else; that the Death

hybrid species, circulating desire, mobilized identities—this may originate in the fact that each thinker represents a very different, yet complementary, theoretical inflection. Contingency For example, Judith Butler literally enacts in the eloquence and precision of her writings a theory of the contingent body, its dis- avowals, hauntologies, repressions, and possible reflexivity. Focused at first on the disciplinary regimes associated with “compulsory heterosexual normativity,” Butler no sooner deconstructs scenes of identity misrecognition in Gender Trouble and Bodies That Matter than her thought is itself caught up in the larger drift of power and its resistances.4 In texts ranging from Antigone’s Claim, The Psychic Life of Power, Giving an Account of Oneself, Undoing Gender, and Precarious Life,5 her theoretical imagination travels well beyond the domain of heterosexual normativity, touching directly on issues

Pushing the Limits in Skin Though the present paper is necessarily limited to horror fiction, and in this ra- ther narrowly defined genre the notion of bodily transformation is restricted to the uses and abuses it receives in horror narratives, it is worth mentioning how transgressive fiction of the last few decades has interacted with the horror genre and how the interpretative scope of bodily transformations has thus expanded. Authors such as Kathy Acker, Bret Easton Ellis and Chuck Palahniuk have all employed horror aesthetics in their novels in order to engage readers in a post- modern play with literary conventions and bricolage of genres, and invite them to question the…

“unaccountability” of the ethical relationship—the very fact that it exceeds all reason, all contractual and reciprocal obligation—that makes it ethical. I am obligated to the other—“hostage” to the other, as Lévinas puts it— regardless of the other’s obligation to me. But while such a formulation might seem to be good news for thinking about the ethical question of the animal other, it only reinforces the very humanism it seems to subvert (again, squarely in line with Lévinas). It does so not only by assuming that the sub- jects of the ethical relationship are always already human, but also by plac- ing the ethical relationship beyond all epistemological questioning— “prior” to it, to use Lévinasian language. In so doing—and here the difference between Lévinas and Derrida dis- cussed in chapter 2 is worth revisiting—the alterity of the other is once again captured and hypostatized (as “…

26 Luce Irigaray: Teaching lack or absence of male sexuate values (Freud, ‘Femininity’, in New Introductory Lectures in Psychoanalysis, pp. 145–69). This ‘economy of the same’, according to Irigaray, results in the existence of only one subject, the masculine subject (This Sex Which Is Not One, p. 74). While Irigaray’s early work critically responds to Freud’s theories on female sexuality (cf., for example, The Irigaray Reader), her more recent work focuses on outlining a path for constructing a culture of two subjects. In her proposed culture of two subjects, love cannot arouse a desire to possess the other or to make the other the same as oneself. The other is to be respected whether it exists internally or as an external subject. This conception of love is an integral part of my study of White’s work: it is her struggle with internal and external others and the struggle to establish the boundaries of her subjectivity that she narrates in her work.

cuteness, noted by Ngai and others, is key, we contend, to the pleasures of many forms of cute content, especially in an era when, as noted, numerous aspects of neoliberalization such as precarity in the labor market and the withdrawal of social safety nets engender widespread feelings of uncertainty and powerlessness. Given these last observations, it is illuminating to situate the rise of cute aesthetics within the context of political depression, a concept that has recently been theorized by Berlant and others; this is particularly striking in recent mobilizations of pop culture nostalgia. Political depression refers to an affective context in which citizen subjects have reached a state of exhaustion due to the “brutal relationship of ownership, control, security and their fantasmatic justiﬁcations in liberal political economies” (Cruel 261). According to Berlant, political depression…

Her equation of pain with certainty, for example, has been called into question by sufferers from chronic pain and phantom limb: for those whose pain resists medical visualization, in particular, self- doubt can be as common a concomitant of pain as certitude.18 Anthropologists, political theorists, historians, and others have taken issue with her claim that pain shatters language. As Darius Rejali explains, “It would be a mistake to confuse the empirical inability to say or think when one is in pain with a philosophical claim that pain is a preverbal sensation, a sensation that has some quality that, in principle, makes it inex- pressible.”19 Medical professionals, among others, have challeng…

Deleuze’s film philosophy. The eleven papers delivered at the colloquium form the core of this book. Rewritten and expanded, they are here joined by seven new, original essays. Despite the variety of their approaches and diversity of perspectives, all the essays pursue three convictions: that The Movement- Image and The Time-Image present a coherent and original philosophical exploration of cinema; that in Deleuze’s approach to cinema, one can find a grand résumé of the most inventive concepts and arguments of his philosophical work through that time and after; and finally, that these concepts have a rhizomatic life that continually blossoms in the arts, literature, and philosophy. Thus the cinema books may be read as the linchpin of Deleuze’s work of the 1980s, bringing out the major themes and points of contact between other important works such as Foucault, Logic of Sensation, and his last work with Félix Guattari, What Is Philosophy?

and the strike, of caressing and stretching out, he appropriated musical dilettantism in order to invest it with a solitary and poly- morphous sexuality. Through reciprocal stimulation, the musical piece brings about the jouissance of the player, who embodies it with his own desire. This erotics is nevertheless unlike a lover’s dis- course, for it does not enter into a particular vocabulary of ﬁ gures. Instead it remains indeterminate to the point that its subject can- not refer to it except sporadically through the use of an undeﬁ ned pronoun: It pounds; it escapes capture. All of his commentaries on the playing of music form a metonymy of this desire that has no image: Barthes observed that when he played, “Something gets a hard-on.” This erotics of the piano gives voice to the musician’s body, to his impulses and beats. It also signals the impotence of language to say just what is at play in such desire. And here we probably see the

A full examination of this theory is outside the scope of this article; I propose to draw mainly on Kristeva’s discussion of abjection in its construction in the human subject in relation to her notions of (a) the ‘border’ and (b) the mother–child relationship. At crucial points, I shall also refer to her writing on the abject in relation to religious discourses. This area cannot be ignored, for what becomes apparent in reading her work is that deﬁnitions of the monstrous as constructed in the modern horror text are grounded in ancient religious and historical notions of abjection – particularly in relation to the following religious ‘abominations’: sexual immorality and perversion; corporeal alteration, decay and death; human sacriﬁce; murder; the corpse; bodily wastes; the feminine body and incest. The place of the abject is ‘the place where meaning collapses’ (p. 2), the place where ‘I’ am

resented – both visually and in narrative – through ‘the wound’ (a bruised or cut skin surface). The wound functions as a trace of where the surface of another entity (however imaginary) has impressed upon the body, an impres- sion that is felt and seen as the violence of negation. It is these moments of intensiﬁcation that deﬁne the contours of the ordi- nary surfaces of bodily dwelling, surfaces that are marked by differences in the very experience of intensities.7 As pain sensations demand that I attend to my embodied existence, then I come to inhabit the surfaces of the world in a particular way. The tingles, pricks and then cramps return me to my body by giving me a sense of the edge or border, a ‘sense’ that is an experi- ence of intensiﬁcation and a departure from what is lived as ordinary. The ordinary is linked in this way to the absence of perception, rather than the absence of the body (see Chapter 8). As Elizabeth Grosz puts it, in the case

But the Symbolists’ understanding and transformation of the classics took a novel direction that no earlier poetic or artistic movement had before. Th e focus of this book on the erotic is not accidental. Th e erotic is not the only concern of the Symbolists, but even where it is not – and it oft en is – it is frequently used as a symbol for expressing an intended mystic insight or understanding. And while blended with other symbolism, frequently of an orientalizing nature, iconography drawn from classical myth and literature enjoys an undoubtable prominence.

PP: Let’s delve further into the necessity of this question about Narcissus: it involves a questioning of the image and the mirror, which can be said to represent this very peculiar perception of what takes place at that moment. Blanchot therefore returns to Narcissus in a very illuminating fashion, for the Narcissus he describes practically recalls the figure of the autistic [la figure de l’autiste]. In Ovid, as Blanchot explains, Narcissus doesn’t speak, doesn’t let others touch him, doesn’t know himself: he doesn’t allow others to approach him, he has no relationship with the outside world and no relationship with speech since the only words he hears are the repetition of the last word he uttered. That on which Blanchot insists here is that Narcissus doesn’t know

stressing the important turn involved in the theory of abjection. Abjection is, for Kristeva, an experience of unmatched primordial hor- ror, putting the subject in the most devastating kind of crisis imagina- ble; but ultimately, certain modes of discourse have found a way of speaking that horror instead of repressing it. Literature, she proposes, offers this possibility in an exemplary way, and may serve as abjection’s “privileged signifier” (Powers of Horror, p. 208). The test of that pro- posal will follow in the subsequent chapters of the book, where we will read Kristeva reading literature in order, responsibly, to read literature by way of her. The decentered subject and psychoanalysis In 1996, Kristeva reflects in an initially predictable way on the aims of what her interviewer Ross Guberman calls “the ‘poststructuralist’ J u l i a K r i s t e v a a n d L i t e r a r y T h e …

As human beings, we have been recounting, writing, criticizing, re-evaluating, and trying to find meaning in various narratives; while living with the narratives, we try to detect why and in what forms we respond to them. We know that for Levinas, an ethical relationship with another person/character is not about understanding or knowing them, but it is about embracing the foreign other with all its incompre- hensibility. The concrete face of the other for Levinas “resists my powers” (Totality 197), so it would be wrong to claim that the other asks for “my” empathy. On the contrary, the face makes one feel uncomfortable, and as a result, one feels compelled to be responsible for that face. For Amiel-Houser and Mendelson-Maoz, the ethi- cal difficulty is to visualize the other person/character as a “radical alterity, totally

In addition to raising a number of highly erotic reminiscences of her partner, mournful remembrances that depict lesbian sex in explicit terms, Pen experiences bereaved arousal in response to other women she sees in passing. The narrator, who has lived monogamously and had no sexual partner prior to Cara, sometimes scolds herself for these flights of sexual imagination: “Would you just look at me: my lover one day in the grave and I was fancying others already” (191). And yet, she understands the erotics of her grief as a mode of self- preservation and a way of imagining the possibility of a sexual life after Cara. “I am only thirty. I will n…

It could be objected that the Gaze, understood in its full Lacanian sense, is transcendental, that it does not 'belong' to any human subject of either gender. Not only could it be objected but it has been - by, for example, Kaja Silverman who uses The Night Porter (Liliana Cavani, 1973) to make the point that the male subject claims the gaze as his own only by imposture.7 A great deal of Film Studies, after the publication of Mulvey's 'Visual Pleasure' article, ought surely to be provocative. After all, it challenges 'common sense' when it claims that beneath what would appear to be apolitical narrative demands lies a relay of looks which both aligns with and promotes power differentials based on gender. It ought to provoke, but usually does not, at least within Higher Education, perhaps because students are immersed in the patriarchal in their daily lives or because the ren…

I set aside, for now, the reference I have just made to thought and, by the same token, to ethics—the two are indeed indissociable. I will limit myself—or try to limit myself—to literature alone. From the standpoint of The Instant of My Death, of the limit or end that this book represents today—that is to say, provisionally (the said “end of Literature” is infinite; it is, in theory, unending)—three things at least seem to me worth noting: 1. The recurrence of analogous scenes, not only, as one might expect, in Blanchot’s work (for example, Death Sentence, The Madness of the Day, and The Writing of the Disaster), or even only in that of Bataille, which is very close to it, particularly in the texts written during the war (Inner Experience, “The Practice of Joy Before Death”), but also in some of the monuments of the literature contemporaneous with Blanchot or that Blanchot deemed to be contemporaneous with his own.

To take some initial and minimal indices we should note that Derrida identiﬁ ed himself as belonging on the left,33 and that his political texts engage with a number of liberal- left discourses – for example anti- apartheid politics or the politics of dissidence. The last phase of his work also involved a qualiﬁ ed endorsement of ‘alter- globalisation’ poli- tics, which Derrida, in a 2004 interview, linked to his own Benjaminian invocations of the ‘weak spirit’ of messianism.34 In a number of texts from this period Derrida devoted time to deconstructing the emer- gence of the new discourse of the ‘war on terror’, and to endorsing its

Her preferred example for unpack- ing how artistic forms can fulfil the role of religion in modern society, providing controlled encounters with the abject or impure, is the nov- elist ­Louis-Ferdinand Céline, whose writings she analyses at length in ­Powers of Horror.6 In an interview with Charles Penwarden, ‘Of Word and Flesh’, which discusses Kristeva’s (1995) responses to the 1995 Tate Gallery exhibition Rites of Passage, she also views contemporary art as offering catharsis in the face of the abject. Kristeva describes ‘ob- jects that purify abjection in the work of certain artists’ (Kristeva 1995, p. 24). For Kristeva, works by artists such as Louise Bourgeois, Mona Hatoum, and Jana Sterbak embody a language that ‘attempts to come as close as possible, almost to accompany [the] state of abjection, [the]

Here, Foucault’s analysis of historical discourses of war reconnects us with Mbembe’s attempt at thinking the contemporary condition of political vio- lence as a form of biopower/biopolitics that has not only life but also the creation of “death worlds” as its main target. For Mbembe, as we hinted at in the “Introduction” to the volume, it is not so much the Schmittian state of exception that is the main characteristic of today’s global biopolitical order (as Hardt and Negri might put it). Rather, it is a “state of siege” that is the distinctive mark of pluralized and decentered regimes of violence that, once again, he labels “necropolitical.”47 As Mbembe speciﬁes, “[t]he state of siege is itself a military institution. It allows a …

A WOMAN WRITING 61 asks herself, and the reader, in the explicit metafictional dimension of her texts, what it means to write, she also asks what it means for a woman to write. Does the woman artist, by virtue of her sex, have access to special psychic states? Does she incur special obligations of decorum and maternal concern toward char- acters and readers? Or is it her obligation to transgress conventional notions of respectability and prescribed gender-marked behaviors? These questions, which occupied some of Lispector's characters from her earliest fiction, now take a more urgent and, at times, aggressive tone because they apply to this writer, the narrator who writes the very text now in our hands. Two instances of Lispector's late fiction, The Stream of Life (Agua viva, 1973) and The Stations of the Body (A via crucis do corpo, 1974), can lead us into a closer examination of c…

of research into actual audiences, audiences are assumed to be at one with the spectral viewer, a generally ideologically compliant ideal. This approach was extremely popular across Europe in the seventies, and though it has met enor- mous criticism since then, it still provides several valuable ideas which I will explore in later chapters. Laura Mulvey’s (1975) provocative essay on cinematic pleasure and the male gaze is considered a seminal example of this tradition. In it, Mulvey argues that the female cinematic spectator enjoys ﬁlmic texts, accepts the patriarchal ideology presented therein, identiﬁes with a passive female image, and only through an adoption of a male gaze gains a form of masochistic plea- sure. Mary Ann Doane (1982) builds on and counters Mulvey’s argument with the suggestion that the female spectator, because of the psychic steps required to enjoy mainstream ﬁlms –…

Guattari write about pleasure as being an affection of a subject and therefore a way for persons to ‘ “fi nd themselves” in the process of desire that exceeds them’ (Deleuze and Guattari 2004: 173). This means that pleasure is a mode of reterritorialisation that Deleuze and Guattari strive to circumvent. As long as the pursuit of pleasure is related to the ‘deplorable’ fact of orgasm, and pleasure is thus a norm, desire remains in a relation with lack. Pleasure thus has an intimate connec- tion with lack and subjectifi cation. If, instead, we untie pleasure from desire, the latter can be allowed to exist as a constructive positivity in its own right. This is why Deleuze and Guattari favour the idea of the masochist: because of its integral postponement of pleasure, masochism remains in the realm of desire. In his early essay ‘Coldness and Cruelty’, Deleuze shows how the work o…

In Rich's par­ ticular case (and the same is true for other feminist poets, see Díaz-Diocaretz 1984a), identifying sources, concealing or revealing to the reader the alien text's origin, is not the central interest, since at times the native context of certain texts are provided in notes, or directly suggested in the poems. In other instances, the alien inscribed voice is so fully integrated that the reader of the poem can hardly realize it is not the poet's own. The latter is a complex area of interpretation because the nature of its function is based on conven­ tions which remain unexpressed since they are generally not explicit. What seems to be clear is that the text may require a rather specialized knowledge

the work of Wyschogrod and it is not at all the case in the work of Cixous where notions of differences which survive, or better still, ﬂourish in the encounter between self and other are both central to her ethics and inseparable from her understanding of questions of sexual difference.16 Yet, in variously tackling ques- tions of difference, all these thinkers ﬁnd themselves relying on and invoking notions of divinity, albeit very different notions. For Cixous, the possibility of a genuine encounter between self and other is one that circulates around a love that can arise only from generosity. A divine meeting in love is a generative meeting through which alterity leads to birth and not death. At stake is always the question of alterity: How do we love the other without either sacriﬁcing otherness or sacriﬁcing self? How can we think through a structure of social rela- tions where self and other are not constituted as opposing categories that meet

that co-­opt desire and claim it for specific purposes. Indeed, as in the two examples of Koedt’s myth of vaginal orgasm and Derrida’s faked orgasm, desire is not about sexual pleasure at all but about politics. But even if Deleuze and Guattari provide fruitful ways of theorising the stratification of desire and sexuality, they to some extent remain blind to the way this stratification of the body and its pleasures plays out in their own philosophy. Let us look, for example, at the some of the writing that Deleuze and Guattari favour as offering un-­Oedipal modes of sexuality. Lawrence, Miller, Literature and the Proliferation of Orgasmic Pleasure Along with other male authors such as Thomas Hardy and Allen Ginsberg, D. H.

involves the viewer in motivated action. The pornographic image is clearly absorbed by the viewer through visual perception, but at a symbolic or psychic level, pornography, as the ‘other’ of art, signifies the hectic and disordered experiences yielded through tactile perception. In Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man the invalid aesthetic response is symbolized by graffiti scribbled on the bottom of the Venus of Praxiteles; the arrested gaze of the connoisseur is contravened by the physical gesture, the touch of the culture lout (see note 36 ). This set of associations is also activated in the Kantian opposition of the beautiful and the sublime. Whereas the form of the beautiful is adapted to our faculty of perception and judgement and conveys a finality of form, the idea of the sublime is a disturbance of these faculties and is an ‘outrage on the imagination’.38 Here again,…

Notions of repetition, return, memory, and the signalling of something new that is haunted by the past are all intrinsic themes that make up a large portion of Blanchot’s work and which Derrida drew on in seek­ ing to define and outline his overarching theory of hauntology in Specters of Marx. Conclusion In their introduction to Ghosts: Deconstruction, Psychoanalysis, History Peter Buse and Andrew Stott suggest that the belief in ghosts is gone and that trying to prove their existence may be a fruitless exercise but nonetheless ‘spectrality and haunting continues to enjoy a powerful currency in language and in thinking’ (1999, 3). While the physical presence of ghostly entities may not exist, we are constantly exposed to ghosts when we read literature.

To circumvent or overcome these theoretical diﬀerences, Agamben ﬁrst appears to accept Foucault’s move away from the juridico-institutional model of power. But Agamben also believes that we need to graft onto it a funda- mental distinction that, according to him, is to be found in the determination of or over life and that resides at the core of Western political philosophy. The ﬁgure of homo sacer (and his/her embodiment of bare life) is crucial to this originary philosophical distinction at the level of life and, furthermore, it is also essential in Agamben’s thought to the fusion between Schmitt’s and Foucault’s views on power that Agamben wishes to promote. Homo sacer, or the human body conceived as a function of useful characteristics of produc- tive live forces, but never as a participating political subject essential to the realization of the good life in the polis, ﬁnds itself in…

and lets it evaporate in front of our eyes, as he tells us that we cannot ‘tell the truth on Racine’. Barthes seems happy that his own practice, and his own appropriation of Racine, should not be tied to a discourse of truth. It is, he suggests, the elusiveness of meaning which ensures the special status of literature, and which no doubt therefore explains its interest and part of its pleasure. But Barthes’s critics were not so happy that the truth claims of both his and their practice should be so seduc- tively undermined. The defence of truth Picard’s Nouvelle Critique ou nouvelle imposture and some of the support- ive articles which followed it are characterized by a rather shocking violence of tone, as Barthes underlines at the beginning of his response in Critique et vérité.10 ‘Such a book has got what it takes to turn your stomach’, declares Picard of Sur Racine (57).

and in Camera Lucida, he details the many material touches upon which photography relies, the shutter clicks and the chemicals, the feel of the paper’s edges. Among photographs and his own notes—he is at once author, producer, collector—Barthes discovers a late, flexible grammar for material association, a montage of attractions. He experiments with different ways of arranging and ordering notes and old photographs: in stacks and albums, strips and folders, frames and page proofs. It is amidst this passing, material traffic—and in the corresponding gaps—that the late Roland Barthes comes to synthesize his suspicions about photogra- phy and death into what he calls the “paradigm” of “Life/Death.” To mark the boundary between life and death, Barthes relies on a photographic figure, the camera’s click; to set that click in print he uses a slash. He explicates the paradigm in terms…

guage” (5). Scarry points out that psychic suffering has referential content: we feel anguish about something. By contrast, we can only try to represent physical pain by calling upon damage (injury) and agency (weapon) as tes- timony, but finally, communicating the reality of pain to people who are them- selves not in pain is a difficult task. Because pain destroys the contents of consciousness (one can think of nothing but the pain), pain is the decon- struction of the self. Without a public voice (Bakan 64), and present nowhere “on the visible surface of the earth” (Scarry 3), pain belongs wholly to interior experience, so that woe, words, and world form a nexus of lonely meaning for the suffer. Byron Good discusses a four-hour conversation with a young man suf- fering from chronic pain, whose own language breaks down as he tries to describe his condition (29–48). The speechlessness of pain was recognized as

12 ﻿Introduction﻿ The next section critically re-evaluates some aspects of the discourses of psychedelic mysticism and entheogenic shamanism, such as the focus on inner spiritual experiences and the assumption of the existence of a pregiven ultimate reality. It will argue that we need to rethink the category of “subjective experience,” and may better speak of ayahuasca visions as co-created spiritual events that are always also influenced by what practi- tioners themselves bring to the table. However, such events also cannot be reduced to mere mental constructions. They can be constructed well or badly and be more or less real. Such co-created ayahuasca events do also open up ontological worlds in which different modes of existence become activated. As an illustration, this chapter will describe a Santo Daime ceremony in actor-network terms. A crucial aspect of Latour’s philos…

feminism, including ‘Women’s Time’ (1979) and ‘Stabat Mater’ (1977a; see also 1974b; 1977b; 1981). I have already suggested that my discussion is selective in its focus on feminist political philosophy and its wider emphasis on questions of social and political transformation. This focus frames the range of my sources, which by and large neglects Kristeva’s important writings on aesthetics, and it inﬂ uences the selection of themes I have chosen to explore. These include an examination of the debates over agency, the notion of the feminine and its rela- tion to women, the status of nature and culture, politics, and the maternal body. It is perhaps not surprising that much of my discussion in this chapter is devoted to Kristeva’s concept of the semiotic. As a quick glance through the critical literature reveals, it is with the notion of the semiotic that her work is mostly asso…

the transcendent. Furthermore, humanity as a whole has this expe- rience, in the shape of history, where cultural origins never go away, even if hidden, rejected or ignored. This point about history indicates a contradiction in Agamben, for on the one hand, he attempts a version of history inspired by Hegel (where consciousness develops in the form of the history of philosophy), whilst for the most part in his early books on language he makes extravagant claims about ‘the human’, ‘the animal’, ‘language’, ‘science’ – as if these were timeless phenomena, always and everywhere the same (the unthinking use of ‘the animal’ is a widespread problem in critical theory of the last few years). Elsewhere, he states explicitly that modernity has privileged access to the thought of language, and thereby completes a journey into language6 but, ultimately, the biopolitics of modernity make …

the subject’s identity. But whatever the success of that dialectical operation, the ‘institutionalising of subjectivity’,1 and of the subject subjected to it, the result will be ‘asymptotic’. The ‘discordance with his own reality’ is a condition of that ego-identity. Indeed, Lacan seems not to be as interested in the synthesis as cure as in the possibility of effecting a symbolic communication between inside and outside which will represent both. It will not necessarily be a universal nor objective effect, conforming to a normal social ‘ego’—this is the basis of his angry disagreement with American psychotherapies.2 The infant’s mirror-image ‘is still pregnant with the correspondences that unite the I with the statue in which man projects himself’, ‘the pygmalion he attempts to make of himself’, ‘with the phantoms that dominate him’. Lacan lists some of these projections: in dr…

tion, the pain of jouissance, unconscious pain, pain as an object of the drive, pain as a form of sexuality, pain as a sadomasochistic fantasy, pain and the scream, and the pain of silence. As it describes all these pains, The Book of Love and Pain constitutes a model of a phenomenological treatment of pain. In addition, Nasio addresses the psychical implications of corporeal pain, exploring in a bold manner the psychical role in the activation of corporeal pain. The author discusses, in this respect, the three moments of corporeal pain: the wound, the trauma, and the reaction, treating of the rapid transformation of the pain of the injury to a mental representation of that very injury. Nasio emphasizes that the memory of this representation of corporeal pain is “engraved in the depths of the unconscious,” an unconscious memory that is destined to return, transfigured as a psychosomatic lesion. It is precisely this transformation

supported by the technical hardware of the cinema, which presupposed a particular ‘capturing’ of contemporary life by the camera and its transformation and representation as an image always pushing towards the future, towards the next frame to come. The apparatus acted as a device, that, as Greg Lambert (2016) writes, ‘literally causes (“makes ready”) something to begin to appear – sexuality, power, the state, God, etc.’ In this case, it was time that the apparatus caused to begin to appear. Given an aesthetic form in the cinema, the time that ﬁ ltered through modernity was regularized, ordered, packaged and importantly able to be represented. The cinema not only participated in the organization of modern time through its technical function but also, in its self-reﬂ exivity, produced images and stories that reﬂ ected the temporalities of life under capitalism, modernity and m…

25 For Barad, this generative aspect of matter is fundamental to the constitu­ tion of reality. It is an ontologically primordial principle to the degree that matter engages “in an ongoing reconfiguring of the world” (Barad 2007, 170). While Barad denies that there are any truly individual objects existing in the world, her position is not far from Bryant’s object-oriented approach. Barad concludes that phenomena are the basic units of reality, and that as such, it is only via intra-action that the world is constituted. Bryant, how­ ever, sees individual objects pre-existing any kind of relation, even claim­ ing that objects resist relations with other objects altogether due to the non-identity of objects and their qualities. Yet, Bryant also claims that the qualities of objects, which are more like active powers than passive proper­ ties, actualize differently in different contexts. On Bryant’s account, a

by which man may gain whatever divinity it is his to possess, even though a constant struggle exists between the forces of love and the forces of reason, the outcome of which is doubtful. The reasoned and rational world must, it seems, destroy the erotic dream, almost in self-defense. Throughout the work of these poets, erotic sensibility is under- going a process of re-evaluation. Less and less are the passions seen as the allies of corruption, capable of reducing man to a level of bestiality. They are beginning to see the integral nature of all the forces operative in the human psyche, and in their works erotic passion is beginning to emerge, not as an essentially evil force pulling man from virtue and from God, but a force that man must accept and trust as a part of his total nature: a force which through a freedom of expression beyond the limits of an externally

such as Kathy Acker, Bharati Mukherjee and The Guerilla Girls, have been driven to “find new forms of subversion, adapting, for instance, the trickster figure.” Political subversion has indeed been a feature of recent experimental writing across the world. In her chapter on Anglophone postcolonial poetry, Priyamvada Gopal dis- cusses how postcolonial literature has been deemed “always already radical by virtue of speaking from the periphery to the metropole.” She is concerned to complicate this picture by distinguishing between both the political motivations and the techniques used in different national traditions. She critiques one especially widely-used term in postcolonial theory in particular: “hybridity.” Thus the poetry of Sujata Bhatt in India, Mutabaruka in the Caribbean and Mothobi Mutloatse in South Africa, to take three of her examples, differs not only in form and co…

social role. It was also necessary because dominant (masculine) ways of thinking assumed that the body was separate from, and irrelevant to, the activities of the reason. It thus issued a challenge to men to write about their bodies. (For an overview of the body art emergence, see Shepherd and Wallis 2004; see also, for example, Jones 1998 and Schneider 1997. For a male response to feminism see, for example, Ihde 2002.) The feminist engagement made the body into a key topic, politically and theoretically. But no coherent position or set of values followed. In her overview of this feminist work Elizabeth Grosz identifies three different positions. ‘Egalitarian feminism’ tends to see the woman’s body as a limita- tion on her ‘capacity for equality’ while also giving her ‘special insight’. ‘Social constructionism’ makes a distinction between biology and the way it is represented, having as its project the insistence that ‘different cultural

Negativity has a central place in Blanchot’s writings, whether in terms of the experience of literature, the possibility of the work, or the nature of its language, and it thus provides a privileged mode of access to what can oth- erwise appear to be a forbiddingly obscure body of writings. However, its role in his thinking is unique and is not to be subsumed to the negativity found in the thought of Hegel or Heidegger, although it partakes of aspects of both. Instead, negativity for Blanchot operates at the level of the ontological status of language, which oscillates undecidably between the assertion and negation of meaning and thereby aff ects the experience of literature and the possibility of the work. To explicate the signifi cance of this negativity it is necessary to turn to another fi gure for whom this notion has become as central and as ambiguous, Adorno, whose Hegelian background is much stronger, but who also works against this tradition to

However, it is important to recognise that Butler’s project had many ante­ cedents – notably, Michel Foucault’s work on sexuality and power (Foucault 1976), Luce Irigaray’s interrogation of sexual difference (Irigaray 1985) and Joan Rivière’s concept of ‘masquerade’ (1929) (which foreshadows Butler’s own focus on ‘gender as performance’) – as well as the wider post-structuralist movement in general. The last had particular ramifications for feminism, on account of the ways in which Ferdinand de Saussure’s and Jacques Derrida’s linguistic theories, together with Jacques Lacan’s psychoanalysis, came together to destabilise the concept of the individual (now refigured as a ‘subject’ of combined linguistic, cultural and psychoanalytic forces); while this radical challenge to humanist thought was welcomed by some for its deconstruction of what Lacan referred to …

a generalized condition of exception, when the camp becomes the dominant paradigm for bare life (once again, the life that can be killed but never sacri- ﬁced), life inevitably is death and death is life. It is indeed beyond the point to insist on separating the two stages or conditions of living (or not living) and, more crucially, it is beyond the point to try to theorize biopolitics from the perspective of techniques or mechanisms that seek to make life live by mobi- lizing a power that inevitably puts to death. Put diﬀerently, it is neither life nor death (nor even dead life) that is the referent object of biopolitics for Agamben, but rather the very principle of indistinction between both, or what he prefers to identify as bare life or recognize in the ﬁgure of homo sacer, and that lies at the heart of modern and contemporary political practices of exception.53 Agamben’s analysis se…

freed it from charges of obscenity. Doubles entendres in love sonnets can be hidden from the uneducated, and erotic images painted for aristocratic consumption can be viewed in private apartments. An elevated musical eroticism requires the same highly- developed sensibility, but even then cannot be named and shamed with any great assurance. Why, moreover, should anyone have invited trouble in an age obsessed with proscription when music’s immateriality exempted it from censure? The lack of evi- dence over many centuries of an explicit musical eroticism doesn’t mean it didn’t exist, just that its presence is harder to identify. It is much the same with the “high styles” of twentieth- century dance, despite the obvious presence of intermingled bodies. Even the most “ab- stract ballets” of George Balanchine (1904– 1983) are drenched in the steamiest eroticism, yet one would be hard pressed to fi nd the issue dis-

and comprehensive definitions, partially because it is formed through subjective and ambiguous psychical images and perceptions. Instead of attempting to define literature through ordinary language, therefore, Blanchot “steadily borders on the inexpressible and approaches the extreme of ambiguity, but always recognises [words] for what they are” (de Man 1971, 62). He does not attempt to clarify lan- guage but to bring out its ambiguous nature. Thus, Blanchot’s writings are difficult to define and interpret: he is “fundamentally opaque at the level of comprehen- sion” (Critchley 2004, 31). His writing dramatises an interest in a reader’s failure ever to capture authorial meaning. Moreover, he, following Barthes’ “The Death of the Author” (1982 [1967]), suggests that in some literature, the work is separate from the author and takes on a life of its own: words are exposed as havi…

reassuring rather than dangerous. She examines these pro­cesses in the films of the directors Josef von Sternberg (1894–­1969) and Alfred Hitchcock (1899–­1980). Before the pleasures of mainstream film can be challenged, Mulvey argues, view- ers must be able to break down the cinematic codes that create the controlling male gaze and the illusionistic world that satisfies the desires it invokes. The cinema depends on three looks: that of the camera, that of the audience, and that of the film’s characters. It achieves its illusion of truth and reality (mimesis) by denying or downplaying the first two (the material pro­cess of recording and the critical reading of the viewer) and by emphasizing the last. Only by disrupting the seamlessness of this ­whole visual illusion can women’s subordination to the male gaze be defied. The visual dynamics described in “Visual Plea­sure and Narrat…

especially Sontag’s claim that photographs of suffering people would be dangerous because they are not critical enough. They trigger specific responses, Sontag observes, without providing the necessary, highly com­ plex and nuanced contextual knowledge required to truly understand the suffering depicted on these photographs (see Sontag 2004: 91). Butler observes: ‘Sontag’s concern is that the photograph substitutes for the event to such an extent that it structures memory more effectively than either understanding or narrative’ (Butler 2009: 70–1). According to Sontag, the problem with this observation lies, in Butler’s words, ‘with the triumph of a fixed sentiment over more clearly cognitive capacities’ (Butler 2009: 71). The photographs, this idea goes, would frame the suf­ fering they depict in a ‘closed’ manner because they are meant to spark a specific emotion, one that makes it possible to reduce something as com­

There are numerous theoreti- cal approaches that permit an understanding of the horror effect of the Gothic body and, whilst Gothic Dissections engages with each one, none are promoted as paramount. Sigmund Freud’s theory of the uncanny, Julia Kristeva’s understanding of the abject, Mikhail Bakhtin’s notion of the carnivalesque that extends the work of François Rabelais and his ideas of the grotesque, or Barbara Creed’s studies of body horror that are inspired by both Kristeva and Bakhtin, demonstrate a diversity of per- spectives that Gothic Dissections employs where appropriate. Our prior- ity is for these individual studies of the Gothic body to allow each part the opportunity to be grasped, as opposed to a particular theory being employed as the tool to best perform a textual autopsy.

This yields a dynamic view of matter: ‘Matter is substance in its intra-active becoming – not a thing but a doing, a congealing of agency’ (emphasis in original).63 Thus Barad claims a relational ontology in which phenomena are inseparable, always already entangled.64 She is most interested in how ‘matter makes itself felt’ as [‘it] feels, converses, suffers, desires, yearns and remembers.’65 Human persons are formed …

PART I THE INSISTENCE OF THE IMAGINARY Introduction: The Mirror Stage No piece of leftist cultural criticism of the 1970s and 1980s seemed com- plete without an account of Jacques Lacan’s theory of the mirror stage – that moment in the development of a small child when, contemplating its own reﬂ ection in a mirror, it delights in the magical correspondence between its own movements and those of the image before its eyes.1 Magical correspondences and miraculous afﬁ nities are the stuff of myth; and if Lacan’s essay ‘The Mirror Stage’ investigated such a myth, it rapidly became one in its own right. The boundaries between reality and make-believe, so Lacan argues, are blurred in this early phase: the ego, our window on the so-called real world, is really a kind of ﬁ ction, while the child before the mirror is said to treat its image as real even though it knows it to be illusory.…

Whatever distance we seek to put between ourselves and the dead, we can be sure the horror film is more than up to the task of bringing it all back home. Unlike the positive critics who see horror as a generally beneficial enterprise, Kristeva (1980/1982) underlines the negation at work in disturbing texts. She argues that the abject signifies the terrible lack that marks us as empty or, even worse, filled with decay. The violence of the horror film is then the attempt to return to a zero state. Get rid of the bodies, the civilizations, the knowledge systems, and any other worthless fraud that masks the true emptiness that characterizes the most basic human state. We are …

Catherine Malabou, Counterpath Whereas the atrocity supplement makes itself both indispensable for the full revelation of the truth and disposable for the protection of the not-yet-adult (it is ‘‘easily detachable’’), in Sontag’s world, such images of ‘‘ultimate horror’’ no longer have the power to disclose any positive or newly revealed truth. Merely the repetition of a once revelatory but now stalled ‘‘negative epiphany,’’ their only truth-function, it would seem, is to reinforce the image in its already established lack of effect, a moribund negativity. Nor, according to Sontag, would such images require the addi- tional shield of supplementary detachment. Rather than t…

For Beckett and for Hughes, the beginning of the trail of Eros and Psyche is found in an attitude of mind which is prepared to ask where the fearful, envious, judgemental relation of male to female originates, given that love, not hatred, inspired the myth of Eros. Hughes' account is specially significant because it expounds Being as singular in essence, and in devolution sexualised. It combines ± not fortuitously ± the matter of Being in itself (ontology) with the gendered- ness of Being's myths by which incarnate beings strive to understand themselves. It is special in relation to Beckett because where Shakespeare imaged the contention o…

Think of the memorial to the soldiers fallen in the Vietnam War. Five hundred feet long, the Memorial Wall is nothing but a funeral stele of black granite inscribed with the names of those who fought in Vietnam. Here

fact the articulation of a "limitless desire" between two women, each of whom is at once the lover and the loved, desiring subject and desiring object. One has to wonder why these lines were chosen (extracted from the immediately adjacent ones) and not, for instance, those of stanza B which re-image the loss specifically of the mother's body ("her heavy or slender / thighs on which we lay flesh against flesh, / eyes steady on the face of love; smell of her milk, her sweat, / terror of her disappearance . . . "). After all, the images of "home and wan- derer, she who splits I firewood and she who knocks" are not nearly as suggestive of pre-Oedipal motherhood as the ones I have just cited. And the recurrence of the word desire twice in the second part of the stanza, first as a vault and then limitless, unconstrained, releasing the homesick heart into the storm, should leave no doubt as to …

Rather, the im- age becomes a merely contingent conﬁguration of numerical values that can be subjected to “molecular” modiﬁcation, that lacks any motivated relation to any image-to-follow, and indeed that always already contains all potential images- to-follow as permutations of the set of its “elementary” numerical points.

Accordingly, the literary critic, Jacqueline Rose, writes: Kristeva has . . . been attractive to feminism because of the way that she exposes the complacent identities of psycho-sexual life. But as soon as we try to draw out of that exposure an image of femininity which escapes the strait- jacket of symbolic forms, we fall straight into that essentialism and primacy of the semiotic which is one of the most problematic aspects of her work. (as quoted in Oliver 1993a: 53) The criticism of the American philosopher Nancy Fraser is less subtle: [D]espite [Kristeva’s] explicit criticisms of gynocentrism, there is a strand of her thought that implicitly partakes of it – I mean Kristeva’…

In these cases it seems to yearn for something like sympathy and consent. (B 337) This is not very helpful either.

a particular reading of Levinas in which the Third is not taken seri- ously enough leads to the attempt to provide an ethics which can then be used to inform politics. That is, I argue that, for Levinas, the Third represents the complication of the line between ethics and politics, rather than a secondary interruption of an originary ethics by politics. The adoption of Levinas as a resource for the thinkers discussed in Chapter 1 is, in many ways, due to the use of his thought by Jacques Derrida. Chapter 3 investigates this relationship, asking whether Levinas can provide the ethical backbone of a deconstruc- tive approach, as he is often taken to do. With a more explicit focus on the difficulties internal to concepts such as ethics and responsibil- ity, Derrida’s work highlights more clearly the problems involved in constructing an originary ethics. Derrida’s work focuses in more detail on the nature of the relation between ethics and politics and

This multiplicity, as the outline below explicates, includes considerations of ghosts and haunting at a general level (as something that, per Derrida’s hauntology, is inherent to Being) and more specific ones, but insists, in both cases, on careful conceptual specification.

The relationship to Saussure’s work changes over time, of course, particularly as the mood moves from structuralism to poststructuralism. Elements of Semiology (1964), for instance, with its sombre and scientific exposition of the sign, is a world away from S/Z (1970), with its ‘magic of the signifier’ (SZ, 4); Barthes had, as several of the texts gathered posthumously in The Semiotic Challenge confirm, evidently read Derrida and come to recognize that the signifier defers the signified.28 And even in the immediate wake of the discovery of Saussure, Barthes seemed unsure when writing the theoretical ‘Myth Today’ essay which concludes Mythologies how extensive and explicit he should be about the debt: as Tiphaine Samoyault reveals, ‘five notes on Saussure are deleted between the second manuscript version (which still carries the title “Esquisse d’une mythologie”) and the published text’.29 But even though Barthes’s work developed from the obedient Saussurean

He explained that the punctum, which is not coded, is distinct from the studium, which is coded. This uncoded detail, he explained, has the power of expansion and enhancement, which is often metonymic: ‘I feel that its mere presence changes my reading, that I am looking at a new photograph, marked in my eyes with a higher value’ (Barthes 1988: 42).

In this way, Braidotti’s neo-materialism seeks to solve the apparent paradox of posthumanism: the simultaneous disappearance and over exposure of the human. This paradox is not simply a theoretical conundrum; it has taken on material urgency in the contemporary climate crisis, which has been unequivocally caused by human actions yet has unleashed events and processes occurring at a scale and level of complexity that utterly rupture the fallacy of human transcendence from ‘nature’ and our exceptionalism.

but dimensions whose sense and confi guration are dependent on the fashioning of the self that is correlative to the environment, then there is no such thing as ‘life itself,’ ” Pottage writes. Pottage’s argument is addressed to Malabou’s arguments about sov- ereignty and biopolitics, but it has interesting implications for Mala- bou’s own practices of self- refl ection and autobiography, as well as for the question of what may emerge beyond an age of plasticity. Malabou has argued that plasticity is itself plastic, susceptible to its own destruc- tion, a consequence of our own communicative potentials and our at- tention to other ways of or ga niz ing our environments. Th e question of whether these environments are always human are raised by Renisa Mawani in “Insects, War, Plastic Life.” Malabou’s ef- forts to deconstruct the divide between biology and history is an op- portunity, Mawani claims, to think the human/nonhuman divide that

Contrariwise, time-images are rare: here the whole is in relation with an Outside

unreason (a term emphasized in the title of his first major work, Folie et Déraison , translated as Madness and Civilization ), in a gesture that, rather than separating reason from what it negates, stitches them together so that the latter is henceforth inscribed within reason itself. 25 Thus, rather than writing a positive history of psychiatry in that work or endors- ing its claims to knowledge, Foucault embarks on a genealogy of this continual reinscription, showing how the discourses of that discipline perpetually retrace the boundaries of unreason. 26 Through this rede- scription of rationality – and his later genealogies of penal discipline, medical knowledge, and the discourses of sexuality – Foucault attempts to trace the internal limit of disciplinary knowledge, as well as of the secular historical narrative such knowledge uses to justify itself, and thereby to fore…

120 Hélène Cixous giving other has a presence that raises the question how to ap- proach or love her but also, and even more importantly, of how to give oneself to the other to be loved and receive the other's love. The 'livre' of Promethea is both book and the very gesture of giving oneself, that is, of se livrer to the other. Who gives herself to whom? This movement of giving oneself exceeds the frame of the book as object, it dé-livre, unbinds, and de-livers. The writer now declares to have discovered a dispossession of the self with the theatre. The Book of Promethea is not a play, though, as in Manne, it is written as a 'braiding' of voices. But here, the author herself is asserted to be plural. She is present as writer and as narrator, as a letter, H, with aIl of the familiar associations with her own name, Hélène, a mute letter (that in fact has no aspirate traits), …

A travers cette généalogie rapide et finalement cette archéologie non ex- haustive de la production littéraire postcoloniale de l’Afrique francophone subsaharienne la visée première était d’établir les connexions idéologiques, éthiques et thématiques qui servent de soubassement à cette littérature. Au- delà de la diversité des œuvres et au-delà de l’hétérogénéité des moments considérés (1965–1980: critique des indépendances ; 1980–1990: dictature ; 1990–2000: guerres civiles et génocide, enfants-soldats, exil ou encore im- migration/émigration), il s’agissait à coup sûr d’indiquer les pistes possibles d’une lecture postcoloniale de cette littérature. En effet, la théorie postcolo- niale peut permettre une lecture dynamique et renouvelée de la littérature ro- manesque négro-africaine francophone pour peu qu’elle se fixe un objet, un contenu et une …

Scheler and Merleau-Ponty are very close. Both see the body as a major consti- tutive of and organizing factor in our entanglement with the world, and Scheler’s conception of the body as an analyzer that determines if and how we perceive something can be found in similar ways in Merleau-Ponty’s Phenome- nology of Perception.1 Further, Scheler’s thought of the mutual penetration of life and spirit leads to a quite “physical” understanding of “spiritual” acts, which is close to Merleau-Ponty’s thought that ideas belong to the flesh. But, of course, Scheler’s point is to spiritualize drives, to enliven the spirit, and not to lead thinking back to the psychophysical dimension in and as which it arises. For Merleau-Ponty, then, the task of philosophy is to think without losing touch with what he calls “primitive Being.” This primitive Being has a “texture” to it, a depth and “corporeality” that is not simply “matter,” and he

Introduction This book is a critical analysis of the relation between the dom¬ ination of nature and the domination of woman. It is a feminist work rooted in the critical theory of the first generation of the Frankfurt school—specifically in the analyses of Horkheimer, Marcuse, and Adorno, which I consider the most developed phil¬ osophical thought of our times. Some of the most important feminist thinkers in the past provided a model for this project: Mary Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Woman is a critical appropriation of the Enlightenment philosophy of Jean- Jacques Rousseau; Alexandra Kollontai’s feminist critique begins from the Marxism of her day; and Simone de Beauvoir’s Second Sex is a feminist appropriation of the existentialism of Jean-Paul Sartre. All these women based their theoretical formulations on the most advanced philosophy of liberation available and, in so doing, deepened our understanding of the domination of woman.

In their account the intersec- tion of life and politics is less a chiasmic encounter than an event that folds inside and outside.

and the diseases of aging that seemingly destroy the self and overthrow the sovereignty of the brain.83 Unlike the aesthetic gaps in which the self synaptically forms itself, destructive plasticity “enables the appear- ance or formation of alterity where the other is absolutely lacking. Plas- ticity is the form of alterity when no transcendence, fl ight or escape is left. Th e only other that exists in this circumstance is being other to the self.”84 Th e radical metamorphosis that results from destructive plastic- ity is the real form of being; it is “well and truly the fabrication of a new person, a novel form of life, without anything in common with a pre- ceding form.”85 Malabou’s recent work on destructive plasticity suggests that aesthetic models of the interstitial gap between temporal modes, philosophical traditions, and psychoanalytic drives of life and death are thus insuffi cient to escape the ideological deformations and power over

Foucault’s commentators have acknowledged25). In La volonté de savoir, by contrast, Foucault’s shift from law to norm takes place alongside a homolo- gous shift from history to biohistory, with each shift in its turn being spurred by a specifi c event: the emergence of population as an object of knowledge and power. With the advent of biohistory, sovereignty wanes and with it the law as the primary means by which sovereign power is exercised. Oft en the sugges- tion in these pages is that in a post- sovereign milieu, populations are less subjected to sovereign power than they are governed through norms.26 Th e result is that living as part of a species for Foucault entails learning to live with norms. Whereas before the advent of biohistory, Western man did not know how alive he was ( just that he was not dead), once the self- evidence of death withdraws, we witness the emerg…

xxx Introduction Forster seems to ask, does the “boundless sphere” of the aural faculty, sub- jected to sound and unable to block it out, make music the right expressive mode for the totalizing aspirations of Empire, pan-German nationalism, or art itself? As Michel Chion writes, due to “the omnidirectionality of hear- ing” and the diffuse nature of sound, and due to “a lack of any real aural training in our culture, this ‘imposed-to-hear’ ”—our struggle to filter and edit the noise in which we are immersed—sound has “the ability to saturate and short-circuit our perception.”36 Pound, we shall see, shared this concern for the lack of aural training; for him, the decay of a disciplined “kulchur” had caused the modern ear to atrophy, its faculty for discernment short- circuited by the noise of the public sphere. As Forster, Pound, Eliot, Sitwell, and Joyce engage with the materiality of sound—the same stuff of music and language used to construct our notions

that relationship. For Kristeva, like Lacan, what is at issue is the birth of desire, or the transition from need to desire. She is concerned with how the autoerotic body gives way to the speaking subject. At the level of desire, Kristeva agrees with Lacan's theories of the mirror stage, castration, the oedipal situation, and sexual difference. But she argues that Lacan discounts the semiotic drive force operating prior to the mirror stage and the oedipal situation. She claims that there is evidence that the logic of signification, the logic that organizes the mirror stage and the oedipal situation, is already operating within the material bodies of children prior to what Lacan identifies as the onset of the subject. Also, there is evidence of semiotic drive force on the surface of children's early language use. Semiotic drive force makes its way into language. It is not completel…

His eyes glisten with tears, and in them we can see a reflection of something, perhaps ourselves. His face pre­sents itself to the camera, to the audience, for the experience of the jouissance about which Kristeva writes—­not merely joy nor horror nor any singular, nameable emotion, but a raw experience of the terrible pos- sibility of (not) being.

In a homage written after Levinas’s death in 1995, Derrida credits him with introducing Husserl and Heidegger to France, and suggests that, more importantly, the reverberations of his thought will have changed the course of philosophi- cal reﬂ ection in our time, and of reﬂ ection on philosophy, on what orders it according to ethics . . . according to another thought of the other, a thought that is newer than so many novelties.

through the intersections of Wilke’s abstract sculpture and Lippard’s essays on “eccentric abstraction.” Since art critics’ purview consisted of gallery openings, museum exhibitions, and artist- sponsored events, the question was usually not if erotic art was “art” per se, but how this new sexually explicit art could be understood as different from pornography. Janis made a point to articulate the difference between pornography and the art on display in his gallery, relying on aesthetic justifications: “Pornography is merely done to arouse the carnal spirit. While eroticism may be titillating, it has esthetic interest first and foremost.”21 In the catalog for Erotic Art ’66, he positioned new erotic art as the most up-to-date iteration of a univer- sal theme and, even more importantly, as a timely response to abstraction. “For it was only natural to find after a succession of XXth Century abstract art movements,” Janis wrote,

a Pipe (1968), Jameson’s “The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism” (1984), and Butler’s Gender Trouble (1990). I demonstrate that sadomasochistic power is constructed as explicitly arbitrary, ritualistic, and reversible, a form of aesthetic signification that contrasts with what is posited as the real and irreversible structures of social power. Through the emphasis placed on signs in sadomasochism and the pleasure derived from them, it is also suggested, within these discourses, that power itself is constructed through verbal and visual signification, confusing distinctions between power that is performed and real. I demonstrate that the contradiction staged here in the reification and dissolution of distinctions between real and performed power highlights a significant quandary that postmodernism poses for aesthetic sexuality. I conclude this book by investigating what the model…

however we generally imagine that there is something in the Object just like our Perception” (An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue, 27). 59. This is not altogether different from Walter Benjamin’s notion of the “aura” in an authentic work of art, but the point here is a more general one regarding perception and appearance tout court, and the relation of the appearance to reality implied by beauty rather than the genesis of the particular work. Nevertheless, Benjamin’s concerns about the effect on art of the technologies of mechanical reproduction certainly have a bearing on what we are describing as an impoverishment of the notion of beauty.

argues that a project like Millett’s “can be counterproductive” (37). Though the idea that you are being attacked by some malign force is not as factual as the idea that the force is part of you, it is nevertheless “empowering” (37) and can feel true for the person with the illness. This view runs somewhat counter to Susan Sontag’s argument, in Illness as Metaphor (1978), that illnesses such as cancer should be “de-mythicized” because so “long as a particular disease is treated as an evil . . . not just a disease, most people with cancer will indeed be demoralized by learning what disease they have” (7). Though David B. Morris acknowledges the importance of Sontag’s landmark essay, he argues that “the effort to cleanse illness of all meaning discounts the therapeutic benefit that positive myths and meaning can supply” (270).

However, Cixous does not conceptualize the body as a better precedence for writing. Rather, she is “thinking of the body as a pictogram, [which] opens up ways of theorizing [ . . . ] bodies and texts” (Banting 240). Cix- ous’s “Sorties” and “The Laugh of the Medusa” elaborate on the Cartesian oppressiveness, which distinguishes between the intelligible and the sensual, as she claims that feminine writing relies on a writing of women’s bodies. Hence, as Morag Shiach argues, in Cixous’s work, “it is impossible to sus- tain the complete dichotomy between mind and body which offers the illu- sion of intellectual control at the cost of erasing, censoring, and hystericizing the body” (70). Body and text do not precede one another, nor are they the source of one another. Only when relinquishing the dichotomy between mind and body, physicality and spirituality, and concreteness and abstract- edness can we appreciate Cixous’s undertaking. Ecriture féminine and the

abandoned the early transformational model for a more abstract mini- malist one, and he is no longer willing to make this move. And what he could not account for on any of his models is the changing nature of the reciprocal pronoun in French which is being assimilated to an adverb, so that sentences (12) and (13) are felt to be structurally similar: (12) Ils se félicitèrent l’un l’autre. (13) Ils se félicitèrent mutuellement. What I am suggesting here is that ‘l’un l’autre’ is now perceived, and treated as a block, and no longer as the combination of two pronouns, which could, as is the case in English, be separated (‘each girl trusted the others’: this syntactic possibility is not mentioned by Chomsky, as it complicates the ‘innate rules’ for reciprocals). So let us go back to Chomsky’s conclusion, the vagueness of whose language I have noted, beyond the necessities of a short encyclopaedia article. Thus, when he states that ‘analogues appear to hold in other

Introduction 5 love is the French philosopher Luce Irigaray ( 1992/1996 , 2002b ), but, while taken up in ﬁ elds like philosophy and literature, her work has not had much impact on feminist social theory (Jónasdóttir, 2014 ). Insofar as the search for love is a central motivation in most people’s lives, in particular in the western world, and inasmuch as women continue to attach them- selves to men in the name of love, this theoretical deﬁ cit is highly problematic. Despite women’s particular ideological enmeshment in the realm of love, the absence of love seems even more marked in feminist than non-feminist works (Jónasdóttir, 2014 ). Indeed, as Margaret Toye suggests, it is probably precisely because of love’s association with ‘the realm of women, the home, the private, the apolitical, the “not serious”’ that, struggling to be taken seriously, feminist theorists feel such a ‘nervousness around the topic’ (2010: 4). Meanwhile – and

To the contrary, only the institution of the symbolic first introduces the differential negativity that constitutes the absence in experience as a privation, and it never sum- marily sublates this disturbance in the Real. While originally he conceives neurotic suffering as symptomatic of the imaginary obfuscation of the lack of symbolic castration, Lacan thus comes to conceive it rather as symptom- atic of the struggle to maintain the symbolic lack necessary to sustain one’s desire, in light of the imposing proximity of the Real. And rather than more fully assuming the lack of symbolic castration, he comes to see the end of

The participatory new media art environments of Rist, Piccinini, and Mori appropriate the art institution’s critical framing func- tion in ways that allow us access to feminist new materialisms that were previously unknown. By inviting us to pour our bodies out in conjunction with moving images (Rist), negotiate affective relationships with nonhu- man creatures (Piccinini), and inhabit body– brain codependencies (Mori), these artists’ new media installations allow us to actively experience and critically assess the multifaceted ways in which we are enacted with the material world.

cordingly, they argue that women, out shopping or otherwise practicing what has been called "style politics," use the rituals of consumption in dress, cos- metics, hairstyle, and gesture to bend the norms ordained by the market and to flout family and other authority. The essays here, though not indifferent to such debates, advance a dif- ferent set of concerns. First, they focus on the construction of gender roles rather than on an unexamined acceptance of the category of "woman" and thus construe the process of gendering broadly, in terms of male as well as female identities. This expanded focus recognizes the capacity of com- modities to move between the customarily female spaces of the market and

But this means that such a nothingness is inherent to the continuance of writing, and as such this problem of starting, which is “the essence of literary activity,” is one that “that the writer must and must not overcome” [PF: 295/303]. Blanchot’s response to this problem is made apparent in these opening lines and throughout the remainder of his writings in the peculiar fl atness of his style and, although widely noted, it has not been recognized how this style ac- tivates the movement of nothingness working in nothingness by way of its employment of a mode of abstraction.

Drawing on the Freudian context of the archive he is dis- cussing, Derrida formulates this violence in terms of patricide dis- cussed in Totem and Taboo: “It amounts to a repressed or suppressed parricide, in the name of the father as dead father. The archontic is at best the takeover of the archive by the brothers. The equality and the liberty of brothers. A certain, still vivacious idea of democracy” (95). As Derrida’s discussion of the archive makes clear, defining “another heading,” a departure from the past, involves projecting back, into the past, a sense of origin that kills the object that is taken to authorize it. And this is true even when the spirit that results is “demo- cratic” and institutionalized around a shared interest in …

more speculative lines of critical discourse. In his book In the Dust of This Planet, for instance, Eugene Thacker offers a fascinating and original con- tribution to the study of Bataille and succeeds in presenting how the ingenuity of Bataille’s thought is to be measured not only by its semantic profundity, but also as a pertinent interposition in speculative discourse on the mystical text. For example, he writes that in his enigmatic text entitled “The Congested Planet,” Bataille attempts something unheard of in the mystical traditions: “to conceive of a non-human mysticism that would also refuse all forms of anthropomorphic personification” (145). According to Thacker, other works by Bataille, including The Accursed Share and Theory of Religion, suggest a similar “mysticism of the unhu-

in particular Deleuze and Guattari’s model of the ‘Body without Organs’. And yet, there has been a significant shift towards a greater acceptance of work by Deleuze and Guattari, most notably from the same theorists originally cautious about them: Elizabeth Grosz and Rosi Braidotti.19 Indeed, Braidotti points out that although most of ‘the uses that Deleuzian philosophy is put to are still polemical and ambivalent towards feminist theory [...] a growing corpus of Deleuzian feminism is taking shape with remarkable rigour’ (2002, 65). She argues that ‘the most fruitful starting point for an alliance between feminist concerns and Deleuze’s thought is precisely the effort to imagine the activity of thinking differently’ (2002, 70). It is also important to note that this movement towards Deleuze has been made before, particularly within feminist theory. In ‘refiguring les- bian desire’, for instance, Elizabeth Grosz attempts to move beyond a

a world’,” which we share with animals because “we ourselves are human animals” (Wolfe 2010, xxv). Braidotti’s “critical posthumanities” are also constructed upon an ontology of “the radical immanence, i.e. the primacy of intelligent and self-organizing matter,” whose posthuman subject is described as “relational, embodied and embedded,” on the basis of the claim of a continuity between body and mind, nature and culture (2019, 1). It is within the reframing of animal studies by the posthuman turn, subsuming in itself the affective and material turns of the new ecocrit- icisms, that I want to locate the analysis of my case study. Because I have also, always, been interested in literature and the literary, and in a formal, or aesthetic approach to it, the aim I have set myself for this article is to investigate how a literary work could contribute not only to that radical change in our thinking about the world—and our place in

157), he does not, as Irigaray believes the subject of the Levinasian caress does, remain alien to ‘the most inward locus of the feeling and the felt, where body and ﬂesh speak to each other’ (ibid. 157). Irigaray believes sexuality has always been examined in relation to a privileging of procreation, with fatherhood being regarded as a ‘proof of his potency’ (ibid. 54). She develops her understanding of the female sex, which designates ‘the place of uselessness, at least as it is habitually understood’ (18), in relation to male impotence. We recall that she regards the ‘sexual relation’ as ‘impossible’. However, for Irigaray, this realization has not led men to be more accepting of ‘feminine plea- sure’: ‘The problem is that they [men, epitomized in this instance as psychoanalysts] claim to make a law of this impotence itself, and continue to subject women to it’ (Irigaray 1985: 105).

Both possibilities are projected on a screen of what is actual and present by means of the poet’s tactic of triangulation. That godlike self, never known before, now comes into focus and vanishes again in one quick shift of view. As the planes of vision jump, the actual self and the ideal self and the difference between them connect in one triangle momentarily. The connection is eros. To feel its current pass through her is what the lover wants. The essential features that define this eros have already emerged in the course of our exploration of bittersweetness. Simultaneous pleasure and pain are its symptom. Lack is its animating, fundamental constituent. As syntax, it impressed us as something of

In contrast to Derrida’s utilization of the notion of ‘general economy’, the merits of that reading notwithstanding, I think it is important not to miss Bataille’s comparatively simple insistence that the general economic perspective literally studies the ‘movement of energy on the globe’ (The Accursed Share: Volume I, 20).

Thus I will critically examine the translations to Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age mortuary practices that have been wrought by nineteenth- and twentieth-century interpretation in Chapter 3, work from typologies in Chapters 4 and 5, and in Chapter 6 invoke a variety of what some might argue are ‘abstractions’, such as rituals, funerals, and other mortuary practices, communities, differences among human persons, identities, cosmologies, assemblages, scales and regions, and haecceities, in order to under- stand the patterning observed from my analysis of the material assemblage of these mortuary deposits presented in Chapters 4 and 5. Enduring relations and extended assemblages I would suggest that all entities in existence (including ideas, techniques, and practices as well as pots, bones, rocks, gold, atoms, etc.) emerge out of relationships among exis…

[his] research.”29 For feminist thinkers writing aft er structuralism, the question of the subject was also central to their work as they sought to challenge both philosophical and psychoanalytic assumptions concerning the subject as sexed or gendered male or masculine. Although there are important diff erences, as the essays in this volume by Mary Beth Mader and Sara Heinämaa clearly indicate, between the theoretical positions of Cixous, Irigaray, or Kristeva, insofar as these “diff er- ence feminists” argue for sexual diff erence and the signifi cant and important diff erences between male and female desire, they had to argue that there were important diff erences between male and female subjects. To make this argu- ment required that they refuse to follow the structuralist project of entirely eliminating the subject. Luce Irigaray, to take one example, is uncomfortable with g…

She does not know precisely the experience depicted by Wall—which is, after all, a fiction—but she knows enough. She is one of those who has “put in time under fire and had the luck to elude the death that struck down others nearby,” and she believes, therefore, that she, too, is “right” (126). Given Sontag’s new commitment to narrative, her conclusion that audi- ences “can’t understand, can’t imagine” the experience of war is paradoxical. She has stated that “narratives can make us understand” (89), but now she maintains that neither images nor narratives about war can reach audiences who have not experienced the pain of war directly. Sontag’s closing sentence, “And they are right,” returns us to the opening of Regarding the Pain of Others and her critique of Woolf for separating viewers into “we” and “they” by gender and for assuming these categories define a particular way of…

The historical trajectory outlined by the collection is of necessity a loose one.The ﬁrst section,“Whatever Happened to Feminism?,”is meant neither to lament the disappearance of a “proper” feminism nor to reproach the transformations that such a feminism has undergone but, rather, to indicate the need to think contemporary feminism in terms of the consequences of its distant as well as more recent history.Thus, Juliet Mitchell retraces the encounter between psychoanalysis and feminism in Britain and the United States from the postwar period to poststructuralism, asking whether psy- choanalysis has in effect syphoned off the political thrust of the feminist project.

Introduction the collections Screening the Male (Cohan and Hark 1993) and The Sexual Subject (Caughie et al. 1992). The majority of this book concentrates on screen masculinities, though the reader will find considerable material on fiction. The tradition of theorization of gender in screen theory has been through Lacanian models since Laura Mulvey's famous and discipline-transforming Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema' (1975) suggested that the camera in classical Hollywood cinema regulates the look of the audience, constituting an identification with a male gaze. An active/passive binary mapped onto masculine and feminine subject positions results in gendered spectator- ship. The male looks, and the female is looked upon; this leads to the obj edification and fetishization of the female body, and the negation of female pleasure. Steve Neale's 'Masculinity as Spectacle' (1983) has been almost as influential, and explored the spectatorial paradigm of the Mulvey

Introduction 11 theoretical disputes to look at ways in which, in the writings of Jacques Rancière, such a critique of an ‘ethics-of-the-other’ position as ultimately politi­ cally conservative is targeted on the work of Jean-François Lyotard. One reason why Lyotard becomes especially interesting, here, is that in Derrida’s mourning text for Lyotard, far from lapsing into the melancholic demeanour of which he is now frequently accused, he in fact dwells on a particular phrase from a short essay by Lyotard included in a collection of texts devoted to Derrida’s own work: ‘There shall be no mourning’. Reading this phrase, not least in terms of the politics of mourning, Derrida takes the opportunity to think of a certain mourning against mourning: that is, a mourning which actually resists the effects Rancière would wish to impute to a certain ‘ethical’ mournfulness. Since Rancièr…

we see ourselves, for example, as consisting of the elements of various rela- tionships rather than as discrete individuals, or as collective enunciations or expressions of environments, then our actions—our expressions of agency— become not so much instances of our own picking and choosing, but rather examples of our propensity to act and react in accordance with both our inherent capacities to act and be acted upon and our environment’s capac- ity to act and, more importantly, to act upon us. Existence, when conceived as an expression of extended agential capac- ities, becomes an ongoing unfolding of interdependent relationships where the actions of one entity depend on the ability of another entity to be acted upon, and where the capacities of one entity are enabled by the capacities of another. That is, no act is possible without there first being a relation- ship from which the act…

change, but this language would also recast the way that philosophy could claim to perceive itself.3 In contrast to philosophers who have challenged the adequacy of empirical schemas of perception, Merleau-Ponty attempts to define perception as existing in terms of a language of its own. Whereas Jean-Paul Sartre’s criticism of any empirical schema of vision is that it ‘could be as empirically adequate as I please, but it could never account for the fundamental fact that I see’ (1958: 403–4), Merleau- Ponty takes up the fundamental nature of this fact as the starting point for his non- dualist ontology (1968: 3). In The Phenomenology of Perception (1962) and The Structure of Behaviour (1963) Merleau-Ponty emphasizes the simultaneous participation of multiple physiological and psychological factors in the processes of perception. In The Visible and the Invisible his emphasis shifts to the …

club, animating all of its dynamics and fueling its current cultural impact. Butler, in her inﬂuential 1990 book Gender Trouble, develops the notion of gender as per- formance, or as what she also calls a style or a strategy.5 Gender, whether mascu- line or feminine, does not exist as a ﬁxed essence or natural identity that we then express respectively as a man or woman. It is not something given, a biological condition that determines a person’s identity. According to Butler, gender has no preexisting, natural, or ﬁxed meaning; there is no primary or interior gendered core to our personhood. This notion of an “abiding gendered self” is, she argues, an illusion, a chimera, a fantasy. From this perspective, gender is a fantasy in the Where Fantasy Becomes Reality • 81

a less intense degree the dilemmas facing women in heterosexual coupledom face all women in their interactions with men in friendship, kinship, work etc. This elucidates the structural character of the exploitation analysed in this book; as long as the structure is not transformed, all women are affected by it, regardless of the choices they make. 2 We might only want to qualify this heteronormative statement somewhat, so as to state that there is no heterosexual or lesbian love without feminine freedom. 3 These conditions can be analysed in terms of the extent to which they advance or ‘become fetters on the existing productive forces’ (Marx and Engels, 1845/1970 : 102) of love. On one hand, by virtue of their ‘immiserated’ sociosexual position, women are structurally compelled to develop their sociosexual capacities, since these are what they have to offer in their negotiations with men, by lack of the authority enjoyed by

aware of the erotic lure of the latter ideology. Bataille’s own focus on eroticism, developed most systematically in his seminal Eroticism (Bataille 2001a), is already implicit in these earlier texts and is also developed in his controversial literary work, such as Madame Edwarda and Ma Mère (Bataille 1986a). Bataille’s later work also develops an interest in the relationship between the erotic and the sacred, most notably in his trilogy La Somme Athéologique, comprising Inner Experience, On Nietzsche and Guilty (Bataille 1988b). Since the 1970s, Bataille’s work has increasingly come to be seen as an important precursor to the development of postmodernist thinking. This chapter will focus on the complexity of Derrida’s relation to Bataille’s work. I will begin by analysing the detail of Derrida’s most sustained treatment of Bataille’s work, in the essay ‘From Restricted to Gen…

1 introduction: emerging models of materiality in feminist theory Stacy Alaimo and Susan Hekman The purpose of this anthology is to bring the material, speciﬁcally the materiality of the human body and the natural world, into the fore- front of feminist theory and practice. This is no small matter indeed, and we expect this collection to spark intense debate. Materiality, par- ticularly that of bodies and natures, has long been an extraordinarily volatile site for feminist theory—so volatile, in fact, that the guiding rule of procedure for most contemporary feminisms requires that one distance oneself as much as possible from the tainted realm of materi- ality by taking refuge within culture, discourse, and language. Our thesis is that feminist theory is at an impasse caused by the contempo- rary linguistic turn in feminist thought. With the advent of postmod- ernism and poststruc…

of conflict; it is the questioning energy of the problematic: For death cannot be reduced to negation, neither to the negative of opposition nor to the negative of limitation. It is neither the limitation imposed by matter upon mortal life, nor the opposition between matter and immortal life, which furnishes death with its prototype. Death is rather, the last form of the problematic, the source of problems and questions, the sign of their persistence over and above every response. (Deleuze 1968, 112) With the death instinct, Deleuze realises his project of the dissolution of the self. Death has, for him, following Maurice Blanchot, two aspects. Firstly, it is the disappearance of the person, the reduction to zero of the difference which stands for a distinct person. This reduction is objectively represented as a return to inanimate matter. But, secondly, death is a state of free differences that are no longer subordinated to the form of the ego, the subject, or the

The aim of this chapter is to demonstrate that action is best comprehended as a narrative discourse of ethics, rather than an expansion of the realm of physics. 4.2 Three Rival Models of the Explanation of Action Let us fi rst begin with a quick summary of the standard explanatory models of action in play. The word ‘rival’ above should be treated suspiciously because each theory of action has as its goal a very different aim and, if one ignores the aim, then the theories do seem to be competing to explain the same phenomenon. However, it is pertinent once again to put on the table a hypothesis which is central

2 Antonio Alcala Gonzalez and Carl H. Sederholm pull apart “the hierarchical relationship between fiction and reality” (24). Similarly, Eugene Thacker draws directly on Lovecraft to underscore the prospect of horrors beyond human thought and experience, particularly as we think about the unknown and the unknowable (9). One assump- tion behind such readings is that Lovecraft makes more sense in a world that no longer appears to make sense or that is teetering on the brink of collapse. Through his view of humanity as something insignificant when contrasted with a cosmic background, Lovecraft anticipated the kinds of concerns over uncertainty proper to the twenty-first century. Although we are not threatened by physical hyperobjects,1 at least not those in the shape of Lovecraftian monsters, we struggle harder every year to accept that no matter how much we pretend to be in contro…

sought to open the category of gender itself to further differentiation and argued that the specificity outlined by this difference feminism was restricted to white, middle-class, heterosexual, Western women. Sub- sequently, this specific brand of difference feminism has come to be associated with essentialism itself. The critique of essentialism, both following the existentialist critique provided by Beauvoir and that provided by later feminists, has opened various other feminist camps, including Judith Butler’s influential theory of gender performativity. Butler integrates her early reading of Beauvoir with later poststruc- turalist theory, particularly the work of Foucault and Derrida; her work has been devoted to the deconstruction of subjectivity and the theori- sation of gender as a performance within a socio-cultural matrix of power, making it crucial to those working within continental feminism, especially those at its intersection with queer and critical race theory.

She censures Spivak’s susceptibility to a “jargon of authen- ticity” (97), a particularly low blow because Adorno used this neologism to criticize Heidegger’s genocidal romanticization of German identity, despite Varadharajan’s own admission that political action inexorably has ambiguous outcomes (96).3 Spivak is reproached for procuring her third world bona fides by dissipating the “particularity of the subaltern woman in the seeming inex- haustibility of the category” (98–99)4 to the effect that theoretical-postcolonial practice unlike determinate-philosophical politics becomes an exotic parody of liberal humanism. In her critique, Varadharajan rightly regards Adorno as a valuable resource for postcolonial criticism because negative dialectics, as a utopic mode of substantive cognition, aims for particularity without recourse to the dog-

desire rather than sexual desire being at the base of the erotic. Sublimation, in this sense, drawing on a Lordean framework, is not the sublimation of sexual desires or a sexual drive into other life pursuits, but rather involves the trans- ference of the erotic into various activities, sex included. This transformative understanding of the erotic, rather than sexual desire, as at the base of all cre- ativity, marks Lorde’s work as an intervention in Freudian-based understand- ings of the flows of desire and the well from which they spur. While Lorde’s essay relies on a strict gender binary that could be disad- vantageous to imaging the gender dynamism of asexuality, I understand her grounding of the erotic in the “female plane” as speaking to a centralization of knowledge that has been epistemically discarded in patriarchal contexts through “male models of power” and a “racist, p…

and reproduces his own scolding for superstitious nonsense. Whilst Emily assumes his position in this argument, we are privy to the knowl- edge that she is as much prone to these fears as Annette, if not more. In the final sentence of this exchange, however, the narrator uses humour against her heroine in order to highlight her faults. This humour sub- verts the authoritative complicity that Emily aspires to between herself and Montoni. Emily’s deference to his wishes in front of her servant is ironized to indicate how misplaced it is. Having learned the lessons of self-preservation through watching passively, Emily now replicates these lessons in her dealings with her own subordinate, Annette. Through its gentle mockery of Emily, The Mysteries of Udolpho suggests that watching and learning in battles of self-preservation is, in the end, a hollow victory. Indeed, one could go so far as t…

But, again, as Malm reminds us, “any call for a more environmen- tally beneficial practice by necessity puts humans front and centre.”48 What now bears upon a strictly human ethics, though, with hindsight, accountability, and responsibility, and with New Materialist critical theory in mind, is the question of what precisely is the human? To begin to answer this question, it is worth considering the historicity of New Materialism and questioning why, along with the looming threat of ecological catastrophe brought on by climate change, does posthuman- ism and the nonhuman factor so heavily in contemporary critical theory. We might consider, in other words, the rising interest in posthumanism and nonhumanism as symptomatic of neoliberal dehumanization. Writ- ing critically about posthumanism, New Materialism, and the represen- tation of Indigenous populations, W. Oliver Baker suggests that these theories should be read “as an ideological response to the perceived ero-

28 Introduction agency under conditions of constraint. In this way, I read The Story of O as one of the spaces of cruel optimism that Lauren Berlant discusses in her analysis of life under neoliberalism. Berlant writes, “In cruel opti- mism the subject or community turns its treasured attachments into safety-deposit objects that make it possible to bear sovereignty through its distribution, the energy of feeling relational, general, reciprocal, and accumulative. . . . In a relation of cruel optimism our activity is revealed as a vehicle for attaining a kind of passivity, as evidence of the desire to find forms in relation to which we can sustain a coasting sentience, in response to being too alive.”72 In her formulation of cruel optimism, Ber- lant connects fantasies of change, manifested as a desire for passivity and an investment in materiality, to the reality of structural powerlessness. Though Berlant is invested in life under the slow death of neoliberalism,

Interview with Pascal Possoz 105 tion of Blanchot’s reading. Yet one cannot account for everything; it’s just overwhelming. And aggravating. PhLL: Up until now Blanchot’s work has given rise to only two kinds of readings: either plainly hostile readings in which it is argued that his work embodies an outmoded idea of literature (Braunrot and Todorov going so far as to quote expressly a sentence from 1938—one that, besides, is no more anti- Semitic than other similar sentences—and saying that these kinds of people belong to the past, that one might as well forget them) or readings entirely subservient to Blanchot. I, for my part, think it is also possible to say that what’s at stake is a text, that it must be read as a text, even if that implies being “critical” at times. One needn’t take everything literally, or accept everything, or consent to everything. For instance, it is clear that “A Primal Scene” is a magnificent piece of fiction. Blanchot was very surprised at

It should come as no surprise therefore that modern women writers who have attempted to create their own erotic language(s) have sought to evolve new ways of treating the female anatomy. As Michie points out, ‘a major although not always articulated task of feminist writing has, so far, been the full and responsible representation of the female body [...]. Since the early ni…

So let us assume, then, that performativity describes both the pro­cesses of being acted on and the conditions and possibilities for acting, and that we cannot understand its operation without both of ­these dimensions. That norms act on us implies that we are susceptible to their action, vulnerable to a certain name-­calling from the start. And this registers at a level that is prior to any possibility of volition. An understanding of gender assignment has to take up this field of an unwilled receptivity, susceptibility, and vulnerability, a way of being exposed to la…

97 Orgasmic Feminism has shown, points to a very different sexual history than that of the male. Both in its being and nonbeing, it has been deeply entrenched in the politics of pleasure. In this sense, it is important as a tool for uncovering the ways in which our bodies are stolen, as Deleuze and Guattari put it, in the fabrication of ‘opposable organisms’ (Deleuze and Guattari 2004: 305). Secondly, the history of female orgasm also entails a completely different set of possibilities that can be employed in the project of escaping stratified determinations of the organism. As their own concept of becoming-­woman shows, particles that are not already stratified create zones of proximity and spark becomings. In the face of the political use of the orgasm outlined in the first part of this chapter, looking at some alternative depictions of orgasm in the latter part suggests th…

we are able to retain patterns and schemas of action as memories. It is this retention of past responses as a storehouse of memories that allows us to consider multiple possible responses to any new object we subse- quently encounter. This ontological fact of memory (distinguished from the particular contents of any specific one) Bergson calls ‘pure recollec- tion’ or ‘virtuality’. The non- synchronous quality of pure recollection establishes an element of indeterminacy in the relation between percep- tion and its object. This delay allows us to escape the immediacy of the present and to open up various different responses to, and encounters with, the world. 9 Bergson’s guiding thought here is that any given thing that interests us is always capable of more determinations than we can make use of at any point. In automatic or habitual recognition, our perception grasps the object and at the same time links it with others in the execution

we are never dealing with a centered subject, but one that confronts its own negative dimension by way of a radical doubt. This is where the top of the Lacanian graph of desire is at its most relevant, where we recognize the absence of an Other for the Other. But the top of the graph, the zone of pure desire, is absent of the (A), which recognizes only the barred subject; with the anarchistic desire the (A) becomes obscenely disap- pointed, making demands on a barred subject that is entirely unaware of its own position except for its being mocked by the Other’s demand. The (A) is itself not composed of this imaginary stuff that will uphold our preferred visions of ourselves. It will, instead, subvert us into a disappointing position that completes the cycle to the return of the barred subject, unaware of itself until it has been approved of in the lower part of the graph.

Kristeva credits Barthes with establishing a literary criticism attentive to this dynamic interrelationship and highlights the new aims he establishes for literary criticism: “The objective of this search is to make manifest the very procedure through which this ‘science,’ its ‘object,’ and their relationship are brought about, rather than to apply empirically such and such a technique to an indifferent object” (“How Does One Speak to Literature?” p. 95; emphasis Kristeva’s). Not only is the theoretical claim to authority radically qualified in this description of textual criticism, but so also are the parameters of what criticism may claim to discover. The aim is no longer to uncover “the meaning” of a text, as hermeneutic models of interpretation set out to do, but rather to find the workings of a poetics (“to make manifest the very procedure”) that includes at once the object of study…

movement that characterizes Blanchot’s fiction, to actualize not its abso- lute idea but rather its “concrete emptiness” [PF: 86/81]. And it is in prose fiction that this power of abstraction is strongest, for insofar as it is a form of language that depends on nothing for its development, it is able to bring this nothingness to its point of greatest exposure. The negativity that Blan- chot sees in language is the same as that which distances it from represen- tation and figuration, but in order to understand its persistent negations it is necessary to examine not only what is negated and how but also what this leaves behind and where it leads language. It is thus possible to suggest that Blanchot’s approach to fiction demon- strates a departure from generic narrative fiction that is comparable to the contemporaneous changes found in visual art as it moved from Surreal- ism and Expressionism to abstraction. Such changes occurred in painting

phe of identity.” In “Motherhood According to Giovanni Bellini” she de- scribes this in visceral and poetic detail: Cells fuse, split, proliferate; volumes grow, tissues stretch, and body ﬂ uids change rhythm, speeding up or slowing down. Within the body, growing as a graft, indomitable, there is an other. And no one is pres- ent, within that simultaneously dual and alien space, to signify what is going on. ‘It happens, but I’m not there,’ I cannot realize it, but it goes on,’ Motherhood’s impossible syllogism. According to Kristeva, the doubling, stretching, splitting, and severance that occur within the pregnant body are a literal alienation of the woman from her own ﬂ esh. As her bodily integrity is undermined by the fetus, this challenges the mother’s personal sense of unity. She is no longer alone in her body; her life is no longer individual. She cannot be simply identiﬁ …

The objective is for “subjectivity to be understood as fully material and for materiality to be extended and to include and explain the opera- tions of language, desire, and signiﬁcance.”27 Braidotti, in conversation with Rick Dolphjin and van der Tuin, helpfully clariﬁes the starting point for feminist new materialist redeﬁnitions of subjectivity. As explained by Braidotti, these feminist materialist thinkers understand the body or the embodiment of the subject as “neither a biological nor a sociological cat- egory, but rather as a point of overlap between the physical, the symbolic, and …

That male bodies and male protagonists in contemporary cinema are subjected to forms of voyeuristic investigation and fetishistic fascination that have historically attended the depiction of femininity is not to suggest that these approaches yield the same results and effects as those approaches have and continue to do in terms of femininity. Nevertheless, the extension of such objectifying techniques to male bodies and psyches onscreen deserves analysis. As I will show, a project of physical and emotional disassembly occurs in the representation of males at the level of film content, e.g., the narrative and the plot. This violence gets replicated, at times, at the level of form, e.g., editing and/or cinematography. Voyeurism i…

2014, 38). This is particularly salient to Barad’s analysis, given her concern for the way apparatuses propel us toward post-human conclusions. Further, Barad wants to push the limits of what counts as measurement in the context of quantum physics. Bryant’s exploration of machines explicitly frames this conversation in ontological, rather than epistemological, terms. Like Barad, Bryant begins with a concern about the anthropocentric limits placed on our ontologies. That is, his goal in developing a machine-­ oriented ontology is to broaden our ontological theories to include the nonhuman in radical and speculative ways. Echoing Barad’s discussion of our intimate entanglement with matter as a part of the “differential becoming of the world,” he claims that we must attend to how “we are both embedded in a broader natural world and how non-human things have power and efficacy of their own” (Bryant 2014, 4).

Whether such a being would be meaningfully sexuate is another question, one challenge being under what conditions such a being would belong to a kind whose reference is fixed to a structure of genera- tional reproduction, including if we imagine this being as the only individ- ual or sex ever of its kind or in relation to another sex coexisting with it or arising at an entirely different time in the same way. We may leave this ques- tion open for further scrutiny. It does not escape me that these thought experiments are far removed from life as we know it.

(the ASA structure). These features enable but do not yet establish the time-image. In the time-image, the subordination of time to movement is reversed, and a direct, rather than an indi- rect, image of time is revealed on the surface of the screen. The time-image pre- sents a purely optical and sound situation that replaces the faltering sensory-motor system and its control of action. Into the world of continuous space-time where prac- tical action occurs, the modern cinema brings the emancipated senses into direct relation with thought and time, where the audience may grasp something too pow- erful, too unjust, or too beautiful, something that outstrips its sensory-motor capac- ities. To the extent that optical and visual description replaces motor action in this new regime of opsigns and sonsigns, a new principle of indeterminacy governs.

the maternal authority from paternal law. As mentioned earlier, the central problem with Kristeva’s theory is that it can be read in a prescriptive rather than a descriptive sense. This problem is rendered more acute by the fact that, although Kristeva distinguishes between the maternal and paternal ﬁgures, when she speaks of the subject who is being constituted, she never distinguishes between the child as male or female. Obviously, the female child’s experience of the semiotic chora must be different from that of the male’s experience in relation to the way it is spoken to, handled, etc. For the mother is already constituted as a gendered subject living within a patriarchal order and thus aware of the differences between the ‘masculine’ and the ‘feminine’ in relation to questions of desire. Thus, the mother might relate to a male child with a more acute sense of pride and pleasure. It is also possible that the child, depending on its gender, might ﬁnd

Although her ‘theoretical’ writing of this period stresses the need for writing to ‘let go’, to make room for the other, her ¢ction is several steps behind this ideal.

Nonetheless, though our selections are scarcely puritanical, we do hope readers will recognize the overtly political positions that the overwhelming majority of our contributors, be they essayists or poets, take. This is the argument of our book: that poetic language needs to be read cautiously because of and not despite its sensual, seductive, and unbearably satisfying qualities. Each poem is intended to serve as an illustration, or development, of the theme debated by the section in which it appears. The poems should not, however, be seen as necessarily connected with the essays that they either precede or follow. While we have…

feminists, such as Simone de Beauvoir and Shulamith Firestone, have often been interpreted by later writers as adopting forms of biologism. To an extent, I agree with those interpretations; yet, there is a danger that in invoking biologism, we throw the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak. For what some of these earlier feminists were trying to do was precisely what many of us seek to do now - to retain an under­ standing of woman’s body as material along with our analyses of gender as sociocultural. So, in sketching out some of these lines of thought, my aim is to trace this earlier history of the biological body within feminism. Simone de Beauvoir’s influential work, The Second Sex, published originally in 1949, was rather ambivalent about woman’s relationship to her body. On the one hand, she famously asserted that ‘one is not born, but becomes a woman’; the category …

As the editors of this volume, we introduce here entry points to a multivalent form of feminist posthumanities as that strategic portmanteau or platform for changing the world and worlding the change. The stakes are high, the risks too. It will however provide seedlings for a new type of “humanities, worthy of our times” (Braidotti 2013).

Noise Is the Presence of the Medium 79 Since the parasite takes a given end – the satisfaction of entertaining a guest, the homeostasis of my body – and turns it into a means to achieving something else, we may consider it a figure of pure medi- ality. Its medial properties help us to recognize the productive element of intervals that Bergson wanted to describe in his example of the sugary water. To appreciate this productive quality of media, we have to be careful to note the important difference between parasitic entities and parasitism as a general function of evolving systems. In Serres’ schema, guest, host and parasite are not substantial entities. They are positions or functions through which any entity – informational, social or biolog- ical – must pass. Serres writes: I thought that the exchangers were intermediaries, that interference was on the fringe, that the translator was between instances, that

Following Hanne Haavind ( 1984 ), I set out from the assumption that, in a context of an ideology of gender equality, the experience of inequality ought to be largely incompatible with the experience of loving and being loved, such that when asymmetries prevail there must be mechanisms that make them appear legitimate if the experience of love is to survive. My focus is not the kind of outright abuse to which most people would object, but the normalized asymmetrical tendencies that I hold to be constitutive of contemporary western heterosexual love. Physical violence and other forms of obvious abuse can be seen as enabled by these more general tendencies, though. Nor will my focus be the unequal structuring of tasks

What “common action” does her work enable in different scholarly fields, in the many institutions she has been part of, for differing subjects? Indeed, The Subject of Rosi Braidotti: Politics and Concepts is the first volume that tries to answer these questions.7 Biographical roots and bibliographical routes In November 1977, Braidotti arrived as a young PhD candidate in Paris after she had successfully finished her honors degree at the Australian National University in Canberra, with Genevieve Lloyd as both her teacher and her mentor. Lloyd introduced the young Rosi to French poststructuralist philosophy and to its feminist discontents. This education was unusual at the time: a feminist interpretation of Western philosophy—from ancient times until after W…

The structure of her texts is repetitive, cumulative rather than linear, using double or multiple voices, often ending without full closure. Julia Kristeva, like Cixous and Irigaray, works from within an essentially Lacanian framework, but she is strongly opposed to the notion of écriture féminine. Nevertheless, she uses the term ‘the semiotic’ to refer to the pre-linguistic stage of development of the child; the semiotic is an area of rhythmic pulsions in active opposition to the symbolic, the stable system of language. The semiotic is described as anarchic and as an area of rhythm, colour and play in language. The semiotic breaks through into the symbolic from time to time; for example, in poetic writing. The semiotic is associated wi…

Benjamin's early theoretical emphasis, developed largely in relation to the history of German literature and philosophy, broadened and intensified as he turned to the consideration of works of art produced by means of new technologies, and indeed to the devices and appurtenances of those technologies themselves. Virtually every es- say in this volume examines some aspect of the manner in which individ- ual works, genres, media, or technological apparatuses mediate the com- plex processes by which we pel'ceive, act upon, and function within that world. This volume, then, goes beyond considerations of modern media such as the newspaper and radio, artistic media such as painting, photog- raphy, and film, and the techniques of display and advertisement that have had such a profound effect on human consciousness and the nature of human embodiment under the condit…

In Noé’s films, because we often cannot see, we are driven to listen. Much of what is in fact seen in Rectum is obscured or only glimpsed. Alongside the constant warping and droning of noise, within which we make out rasped breaths or indeterminate grunts and moans, or the crack of a whip across flesh somewhere beyond the frame, human bodies appear as fragmented and fleeting singularities, warped and contorted in arrangements we cannot map, and never long enough for us to establish what is occurring within this space (Figure 2.1).

The risk, in trying to achieve a more meaningful view of pessimism, is that our sympathies simply shift from one side to the other, so that optimism is flattened in the same proportion as pessimism is deep­ ened. This, I fear, is what happens in some parts of Dienstag’s book, which, in the course of complicating our conceptions of pessimism, ends up paint­ ing a too ­simple (and sometimes caricatural) picture of optimism.35 This is a tendency and temptation against which I ­will be constantly on guard, and that I ­will ­counter by trying to do justice to the deep moral intuitions and investments that stand ­behind the proj­ects of such arch-­optimists as Leibniz and King.

person and thereby leaving them vulnerable to arbitrary arrest and indeﬁ - nite detention. However, Agamben radicalises this insight by insisting that the politicisation of natural life is paradigmatic of modern politics. In The Human Condition, Arendt critically describes how life itself has become the object of politics in modernity. However, she differs funda- mentally from Agamben in wanting to recuperate from Greek thought an idealised image of the citizen as world-constituting actor, which is the counter-point to her analysis of the world-poor refugee. By participating in action, citizens reveal their singularity and thereby distinguish themselves as human. This existential achievement of action is denatured when poli- tics becomes preoccupied with the concerns of the life process itself; hence, the need to revive a conception of politics as an end in itself, through which humans invest the world with meaning and actualise their freedom.

here and following, exposes the nonsense in every articulation of sense, but, more relevant for this text, the sense in every nonsense. Noise may seem free to be anything because it can- not be definitively defined as any single thing — its ontology is particularly fraught — but is this part of the ontology of noise or the limitations placed on the concept by ordinary language? Instead, this text highlights the possibility that noise is able to interrupt seemingly fixed and constrained systems of mean- ing and knowledge, because it exists outside them as ground and remainder. In this sense, noise must strive, by way of the concept, to transcend its concept, to undermine, to change the focus of a remark, of a performance, of a body, in order to reverse altogether the enjoyment (jouissance) we might have taken in it, the meaning we might have given it. nnnnnn Noise indicates the untruth of identity — the fact that

its alterity by incorporating it into a pre-existing totality. It is on these grounds that Levinas takes issue with Western philosophy, which in his view ‘has most often been an ontology: a reduction of the other to the same’, in short, an ‘egology’.9 Levinas seeks to break with this history by repositioning ethics, rather than ontology, as ‘ﬁrst philosophy’.10 But a series of crucial questions arises here, which threatens to undermine Levinas’s project: ‘how can the same, produced as egoism, enter into relationship with an other without immediately divesting it of its alterity?’11 How, for example, can Levinas give an account of the Other without turning that Other into an object of philosophical enquiry and thereby into a projection of the same? Levinas grapples at length with these questions in Totality and Inﬁnity and his other key work, Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence (1974),…

Overall though, he aims “to possess” “the whiteness” of Christabel, “which was part of her extreme magnetism” (301) and yet he cannot contain her, because, as the narrator notes, she was “like Proteus … liquid moving through his grasping fingers” (308). However, once the love illness abates, Ash confesses to his wife Ellen, “For the last year per- haps I have been in love with another woman. I could say it was a sort of madness. A possession, as by daemons. A kind of blinding” (492), noting once again the ways in which erotic love overtakes the lover, causing infir- mity in the lover who becomes controlled by eros. Ash even notes that “Eros is a bad and fickle godhead” (179). In addition to highlighting the dangers of erotic love, Byatt also por- trays another type of love, Platonic love, perhaps as a cure for acquisitive

attempt to think about the world-without-us philosophically .” 131 Thacker’s “world-without-us” is, like horror itself, a great equalizer or leveler. In this negatively thought world, things may look “bad” for humans or, at least, from a human perspective. Things in this “world-without-us” may well be horrific or horrifying, as we humans like to put it. After all, as novelist and literary theorist David Peak puts it, both culturally and philosophically, horror is “concerned with the cosmic paralysis of humanity.” 132 But just as horror is indifferent with regard to the human and the non-human (it does not recognize this dualism), so is the “world-without-us.” To that world and that thought, the presence or absence of the human is, at best, an afterthought. To the “world-without-us,” human substance or presence is an afterthought because, as Thacker puts it, the “world-without-us”/ horror has already subtracted the human from it. 133 Or, as I preferred to put it

love.” The expression had long meant promiscuity, the cir- culation of bodies, easy lays. Now we have to understand it at a higher level as the oxymoron par excellence, the im- probable union of belonging and independence, a new sys- tem that affects us all, whatever our milieu, our opinions, our inclinations. How can love, which attaches, be compat- ible with freedom, which separates? The field of love is divided between two great discourses that pass through multiple channels: the discourse of la- ment and the discourse of subversion. For the former, the truth of love was lost somewhere between the troubadours and the Romantics; for the latter, it is still to come, when humanity, having rid itself of its bourgeois trappings, has broken its last chains. This gives rise to two contradictory projects: restoring and overthrowing. Erasing the accursed parenthesis of the sixties, rehabilitating the traditional fam- ily, repealing the rights accorded women, or, inversely, do-

Introduction 3 One can no longer speak of rights and freedoms without encounter- ing the specter of the “terrorist” or without making allowances for a form of political existence which is excluded and/or excludes itself from the rule of law. The recent work of Giorgio Agamben posits sovereignty itself as an unconditional power over life and death which converts cer- tain modes of existence into “bare life”—life which is deﬁned through a ban, as in the case of the homo sacer (sacred man) who cannot be sacri- ﬁced, yet the act of killing him is unpunishable by law. It could be said that the life of the “terrorist” in this sense is “bare life” and represents an “extra-territorial threshold in which the human body is separated from its normal political status and abandoned ... in a state of exception.”9 Bare life exists at the limit point of freedom and sovereignty, reveal- ing the constitut…

Taken together, these texts offer to those who are not well acquainted with I)crrida's writing an introduction to his work and to the phenomenon known as "deconstruction"; to those who are, they invite a fresh consideration of the significance of literature— literary texts and the institution of literature—in Derrida's work, and of Derrida's work in literature. Editors of anthologies conventionally preface their volumes with remarks on the necessary arbitrariness of selection, the inevitable vio- lence of excerpting, the regrettable impossibility of true representative- ness. All these disclaimers are as valid for this anthology as for any other, if not more so; Jacques Derrida's work seems especially ill suited, in its arguments as well as in its form, to the neat compartments, the simplified …

bours violent and damaging potentialities but also hints at the obverse – that love also founds human sociality through the connection and recog- nition, the caring and giving, it offers. Recalling the stories of love reveals not just its passions and its difﬁculties but also its ethical and political potentialities. While Moffatt and Hillberg’s Love video portrays only the potential violence and madness of love I will trace also the care and gen- erosity and the passionate engagements facilitated by love that form the basis for political and ethical life. The third recurring theme that struc- tures the love stories told here, then, is this: that ethics and politics are not simply founded on duty or on rational agreement but that human sociality requires the generosity and the sharing offered through love. These three themes – love as narrative, love’s troubles and paradoxes, and an ethics and politics of erotics – are elaborated through a conver-

or irrelevant to discourses on the animal. Contrary to Jardine, many feminists have shown that the notion of becoming-­woman can indeed be very helpful in the political struggle to create spaces where it becomes possible to escape and remould binary and delimiting subject positions, what, for instance, Braidotti calls nomadic sub- jectivity. In Chapter 4, I employ the concept to unlock Deleuze’s gendered conceptions of the orgasm and in Chapter 7 I use it to try to free the orgasm from some of its representational and capitalist struc- tures. But just as becoming-­woman only becomes comprehensible if you take into account Deleuze and Guattari’s project of revealing molar and molecular politics, as well as the lines of flight through which stratified concepts may be allowed to become, understanding the radical potential of becoming-­animal, too, demands that you rec- ognise this…

Deleuze's ideas at once challenge older conceptions of the movement of time and reveal new potentials for cinema as a means of thinking in time. In earlier forms of radical critique, film images are regarded as distorted or false representations of the world whose dangers lie in cinemas seductive powers that tap (unknowingly) into the deep- est parts of our unconscious and so must be regarded with suspicion. Deleuze instead focuses on the generative possibilities of aesthetic practice that can create new relation- ships between objects, ideas, temporalities, and spaces that are both actual and spec- ulative. For Deleuze, the movement of time is always the potential for transformation and new thought. This idea of creative thought and invention links Deleuzian phi- losophy with the most radical experimental impulses in avant-garde film practice in which cliched constructions of time and n…

argue in the second part of this book, the accounts of biopower and biopolitics by Giorgio Agamben, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri are exemplary in this respect, being thoroughly heterogeneous to Foucault’s original articulation of these concepts, for better or worse. The point is that the question of whether this divergence is indeed ‘for better or worse’ should not be decided on the basis of the author(s)’ ﬁdelity to the ‘original’ but on its own terms and in its function in the contemporary discourse. If the purpose of the study of thought is not a mere consecration of the thinker, the groans and protests that this thought elicits in the process of its deformation might well be indications of its remaining alive and capable of being put to use. The emphasis on inﬁdelity also means that we approach Foucault’s work not merely substantively as a set of histories or even a theory of historiography but

the ‘human’ in the relationship is highly variable – different peoples inevitably live in difference spaces with different creatures. The attention to complex relationships emerging historically is an important element of ecological and feminist approaches. Donna Haraway (2003) emphasises our situation of ethical relating that arises from our co-evolution with certain spe­ cies. For Val Plumwood (2000), humans have always been part of co-constitutive relations with other species and domestication cannot be entirely read as some original state of ‘fall’. Karen Davis (1995) posits that feminist concern for domes­ ticate animals involves learning from them and appreciating their lifeways, not dismissing them as ‘inauthentic’. The abolitionist/separatist position articulates the problematic dualism of civilisation and wilderness in Plumwood’s view, or a gendered denigration of the ‘tame’ or domesticated (and thereby feminised) for

And here one has to go back to Blanchot’s texts as they first appeared and see the extent to which they were conceived as articles (in this case, for Le Nouveau Commerce),32 while in The Writing of the Disaster, one has the impression that one is dealing with juxtaposed fragments. As for Narcissus, I’m convinced that what he wanted to destroy is, quite simply, the conventional conception of narcissism. As if Narcissus presupposed a constituted self, looking at itself. . . . Instead, Blanchot says that it presupposes it to such a small extent that it is rather a dislocation of the subject even before any possible birth of a subject.

and thereby affirm traditional notions of feminity, but they also remain caught in the logic of the One/the Same underlying these traditional notions, which present them at best as equal and/or complementary to each other. Luce Irigaray, on the other hand, wants to escape this logic of the One/the Same by elaborating the idea that human being is not one but two, male and female, and that thinking this dual being means imaging, signifying, telling, valuing and elaborating this irrevocable, corporeal difference between the two as an irreducible difference in the symbolic, thus on the level of imagination and signification. This conclusion illuminates in turn the philosophical implications of this project. For as the order of discourse is constructed by means of the logic of the One/the Same, the act of replacing this order of the one by the two of sexual difference necessitates the re-imagination

of a system. In the eyes of the sovereign, all people are potential homines sacri.93 The fascination that Agamben’s theory of sovereignty exerted doesn’t attest to the fact that today the state of exception threatens to become the norm, as Agamben claims. To the contrary, it points to the fact that we now live in a society governed by an excess of positivity in which a state of exception is no longer possible. We often are fasci- nated by things that are on the brink of disappearing.94 The state of exception is a state of negativity. It is only possible given an intrusion of the other or exterior. The positivization of society totalizes the normative state today by stripping it of all negativity and transcendence. It totalizes the inte- rior, obliterating any exterior. Terror is produced not only by the transcendence of sovereignty but also by immanence. The terror of positiv…

Cinematic and televisual examples both compliment my theorisation of desire and offer their own contribution. In other words, the use of film and television in this project is not simply a matter of applying theory to text but evidence of the ways in which these mediums deepened, enrich and provide an understanding of desire. The first three chapters are more heavily weighted towards a theori- sation of desire; the final two chapters consider more specifically how desire can be theorised through cinematic and televisual examples. Chapter 1, for instance, traces the concept of desire from Freud to fem- inism to film in order to provide the reader with the necessary theoret- ical background to appreciate the practical applications of the concept of desire to contemporary film, television and popular culture.

introduction 5 As far as the cinema is concerned, one of its fundamental properties is, of course, its ability to record time and impose duration. While the new spectato- rial modes evinced by portable devices are defined by an ever-greater flexibility in terms of temporal manipulation, when watched under fixed-time conditions cinema strictly enforces its own temporality. In fact, as Mary Ann Doane has shown, the ‘linear, irreversible, “mechanical”’ temporality of the cinematic apparatus already constituted a major source of anxiety at the time of its appearance insofar as cinema’s recording of time becomes immediately ‘char- acterized by a certain indeterminacy, an intolerable instability. The image is the imprint of a particular moment whose particularity becomes indetermina- ble precisely because the image does not speak its own relation to time’ (2002: 163). Subsequently, cin…

STRUCTURALISM AND SEMIOTICS 13 FURTHER READING Barthes, Roland (1990b) S/Z, trans. Richard Miller, Oxford: Blackwell. This book is, as its preface states, the trace of work done during a two-year seminar (1968–9) at the École pratique des Hautes Études. While it provides some interesting principles of structuralist analysis, it is nonetheless an extremely close reading of Balzac’s novella line by line. It is, perhaps, the implications of Barthes’ painstaking reading which remain of interest to students today. Barthes, Roland (1993) Mythologies, trans. Annette Lavers, London: Vintage. This is a highly readable and engaging text which outlines Barthes’ theory of the structure of ‘myth’ as well as offering a series of short essays on aspects of French bourgeois culture as examples of how the theory may be used to engage with the everyday. These essays range from readings of advertisements for soap powder, through wrestling matches, to an exhibition of photographs entitled ‘The Great

dead mother, which relation itself might be marked as gay, queer!65 What interests me in Camera Lucida is not its phenomenological as- sertions themselves, and neither is it the precise psychological value of the mourning that is enacted in the work; what interests me is the physicality of the historical contact that Barthes asserts as achieved in looking at a photograph, and that seems a likely culmination of a critical career whose first major publication was Miche!et. 166 At points, then, Camera Lucida echoes those bodily concerns and familiar deconstructive methods of earlier work. A photograph can delight: repeating the Preface to Sade, Fourier, Loyola Barthes sug- gests, "I like certain biographical features which, in a writer's life, delight me as much as certain photographs; I have called these fea- tures 'biographemes.' " 167 But the photographic detail, the fragment (what he ca…

identify the features of afﬁ rmationism that will later take on more solid, and ﬂ orid, forms. The charge that deconstruction is negative, in the bad sense, is remarkably persistent. Even a thinker as heavily indebted to decon- struction as Giorgio Agamben does not hesitate to make this claim, although in the form of an esoteric allegory. In his essay ‘Pardes: The Writing of Potentiality’ Agamben takes up the Talmudic story of

psychoanalysis itself might be brought into the picture, via the notion of abjection. This is the effect of focusing on Freud's more 'anthropological' writings and thence on religious practices in general. Secondly, however, as several writers have noted,18 Powers of Horror introduces a marked 'lightening' of style with a more liberal use of the first person and the more frequent inclusion of personal experience as illustrative of points being made. In this respect, we find Kristeva tacitly acknowledging her debt to Roland Barthes. Moreover, whereas prior to 1980, semiotics and psycho- analysis were brought to bear on works of art (cf. poetic language), now the tendency is to invoke works of art in order to illuminate, or even explain, concepts such as abjection. Céline's work is, for instance, used in this way. A similar stylistic approach appears in two other works of the …

Kristeva put her theory to work in her own psychoanalytic practice when she was seeing a boy who had difﬁculty “accessing the symbolic,” that is, speaking. It is not terribly uncommon for an analyst to treat a child with delayed language development. Instead of treating his problem head on, though, Kristeva focused on what she saw as the foundation of the symbolic: the imaginary realm of signiﬁcation with its accompanying semiotic modes of signiﬁcation. Picking up again her distinction between the semiotic and the symbolic, Kristeva writes that she distinguished between the semiotic, which consists of drive-related and affective meaning organized according to primary processes whose sensory aspects are often nonverbal (sound and melody, rhythm, color, odors, and so fort…

In her now classic essay, “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,” Laura Mulvey tells us that three visual perspectives define film: the camera’s record of the profilmic event, the looks at one another by characters within the film, and the viewing of the filmed event by the audience.8 We are supposed to forget about the first two, so that we may be entirely caught up in the illusion of projecting ourselves onto the screen characters and into their looks at one another. Alternative, radical filmmakers, Mulvey proposes, begin by “free[ing] the look of the camera into its materiality in time and space and the look of the audience into dialectics and passionate detachment,” so that the “pleasure and privilege . . . [of being] the ‘invisible guest’” is smashed (448). Though Mulvey is interested primarily in how the gaze, or “looking relation” (Gaines), produced through narrative and camera techniques in film is voyeuristic and

INTRODUCTION 5 In their attack on male love as selfish and domineering, the radical feminists get support from unexpected quarters: Nietzsche, for example. As Irving Singer puts it, "Far from being selfless and sacrificial, sexual love is for him the best illustration of self- interest and the universal will to power. . . . Nietzsche calls atten- tion to the relentless quest for domination that motivates the lover's need to possess."4 Way before Nietzsche it is fascinating to see that the same complaints about love or the deficiencies of men as lovers voiced by feminists and indeed women in general appear in Plato's Phaedrus, where Lysias complains that the lover is selfish and exploitative, jealous and faithless, hurtful and unreli- able. Because he is in a state of temporary madness, he might always leave when he recovers; in the meantime he wants to reduce the beloved to a state of d…

paradigm. Arguably, however, given the model of explanation and explanatory states it works with, they are insoluble. This book, by contrast, aims to develop an alternative which starts out from the very feature the dominant paradigm most neglects – the way psychological states explain behaviour by showing how they provide our reasons for acting as we do. Key to this, we shall maintain, is that reporting these states involves revealing an aspect of the agent’s perspective upon the world. What makes them reasons for an action is the fact that from this perspective that course of action is the appro- priate thing to do. We understand her action just because we grasp that, and to grasp that involves imaginatively sharing her perspective. We have to be the same sort of creature as she is to do this. But this is not because the inner workings of our brains replicate those of hers, as some functionalists contend. It is because, allowing for individual

of currency in the history of Western metaphysics.1 In feminist theory, essentialism articulates itself in a variety of ways and subtends a num- ber of related assumptions. Most obviously, essentialism can be located in appeals to a pure or original femininity, a female essence, outside the boundaries of the social and thereby untainted (though perhaps repressed) by a patriarchal order. It can also be read in the accounts of universal female oppression, the assumption of a totalizing symbolic system which subjugates all women everywhere, throughout history and across cultures. Further, essentialism underwrites claims for the autonomy of a female voice and the potentiality of a feminine language (notions which find their most sophisticated expression in the much discussed concept of écriture féminine).1 Essentialism emerges perhaps most strongly within the very discourse of fem…

Introduction The present volume can be read side by side with Reading with Clarice Lispector (University of Minnesota Press, 1990). The readings included were given in semi- nar form by Helene Cixous between 1980 and 1986 at the Universite de Paris VIII, at the Centre d'Etudes Feminines. The selections are my own, except for the passages on Kleist that Cixous wished to have included. The organization into chapters, as well as the selection of about 600 pages for the two volumes from among the original 2,500 pages, are also my own. I kept those passages that seemed the most significant —at times the most controversial — of Cixous's thought. Much of the material under discussion —all eminently readable because of the pedagogical tenor of the seminars — is elsewhere transformed poetically in her fictional writings. In these pages she explains what her fiction performs. The seminars can be r…

As here indicated, the situation for feminist posthumanities today remains espe- cially coloured by its legacy of feminist science studies and its insistence on the bio-curious creativity of feminist theory, as is evidenced in the works of feminist environmental humanities pioneer Stacy Alaimo, or in the transformative and alter-worlding works of Eva Hayward and her collaborations with feminist biolo- gist Malin Ah-King. Gender, like “genus” and “generation” (Hemmings 2011, van der Tuin 2015), may well in this setting be remembered for how it has functioned in academic institutions: as an engine of discovery as much as a category of cri- tique. Haraway’s work, especially her ﬁguration of the cyborg, with its insistence on a material-semiotic relationality that indexes our sense of belonging, stand in any case out as particularly fertile starting point for feminist posthumanities. Yet eve…

ters 2012. 8. Drew Leder suggests that the reason why pain involves such ‘return’ to the body is that normally the body is ‘absent’ in the sense that we are not positionally con- scious of its functioning; our reflective attention is not directed to our bodily states: ‘Insofar as the body tends to disappear when functioning unproblemati- cally, it often seizes our attention most strongly at times of dysfunction’ (Leder 1990: 4). But, echoing Scarry, he also suggests that pain can often lead to a body that turns in on itself (Leder 1990: 74). 9. Scarry’s view has been challenged by, for instance, Lucy Bending, who argues that people not only have an overwhelming need to make sense of their pain, but they also have a large reservoir of cultural significations that enable processes of mean- ing-giving to experiences of pain (Bending 2000: 86).

bespeaks neither the simple opposition of life and death nor their total con- juncture or overlapping, but rather the différantial structure whereby life nec- essarily comes into being and persists via the “economy of death” just named. This logic comes to be reelaborated, I go on to show, in the thought of survival in Derrida’s later work, the thought of life as structurally, originarily living on, in the sense of living on for some indeterminate time to come or living on and surviving in the wake of a trauma. While legible to various degrees in other areas of Derrida’s work, the chapters that follow show that the thought of life death—and in turn survival—in deconstruction emerges most forcefully in Derrida’s engagement with Freud, where Derrida is able to think through a set of problematics central to the deconstructive project in toto.1 The project of tracking this trajectory…

about individuality, selfhood, embodiment, sexuality and autonomy. And I hesitate to suggest that this is as true of much of the work in feminist theology as it is of the more mainstream theological traditions, regardless that their reasons for arriving in the same place may be informed by very different concerns. Yet the love of which Hélène Cixous most passionately speaks, in the name of a different, more just relation between self and other, seems to be a love which nonetheless bears an uncanny resemblance to at least to the spirit of agape. It is divine, at least inasmuch as the divine signals a mystery that escapes the capa- cities of signifying systems. It is a gift, but not one that an ‘I’ can give a you, for an ‘I’ can never have it to give in the ﬁrst place. It is neither decided upon nor willed, but functions more like grace. In its most ideal form, Cixous’ love is bestowal; it is a blessing, except that in her case the metaphor is more one of emergence

temporal disjointing, iterability, the movements of revenance and supplementarity. That ‘ﬂuidity’ and ‘oscillation’ as signs of the spectral take place is clear enough. I want to pause here, however, to consider another aspect of The Lifted Veil suggested by Terry Castle’s reading of the spectro-tropological work of phantasmagoria considered in the previous section of this chapter. Castle’s thesis, that there occur throughout the nineteenth century the effects of transport, of transference, and translation from the literal to the metaphorical as the signs of the ‘spectralization of the mental space’ belonging to an unstoppable internalization, is clearly at work in Eliot’s projection of phantom images onto the mind of Latimer. Indeed his ‘foresight’ brings into focus the power of language to make

analyze in its privileged way. I take that to be a reductio. Put in the briefest terms: wherever we admit action and responsibility (as well as perception and the intelligent use of perception in directing action), we admit agency; wherever we admit agency, we must (as far as anyone has argued) admit the individuation and reidentifiability of individual agents; and wherever transcendental agents reflect (or must reflect) on what is empirically given, such agents and the egological agents of experience must, in effect, be one and the same. Any principled disjunction here, must, accordingly, be inco- herent; but to admit the formal point is not yet to say what the “nature” of empirical and transcendental “egos” is. It’s entirely possible—even convincing—to suggest that effective agency depends on more than can be assigned to any ego (any single mind or brain, for instance), sinc…

gloomy mystic, or a melodramatic misanthrope— in a word, a pessimist. It is time that this tendency within Western philosophy is overturned. It is time that we follow the trajectory of our first moral experiences of reality and take seriously the possibility that existence may not be good, or even value- neutral, but may in fact be inexorably and irrevocably evil. It is time, in other words, that pessimism is redeemed from the margins of the history of Western philosophy, rescued from the periphery of our moral discourse, and placed squarely at the center of our ethical con- siderations as a reflection of a primal ethical truth that is immanent in material existence itself. Only by taking this possibility seriously can we hope to craft a theory of moral value which affirms our primordial ethi- cal instincts and develop from it a more realistic and more effective model of moral normativity, and perhaps even social and political responsibility.

We would not be able to see things in just the way human beings do if we were not at least indirectly aware that, even as we see, we too are visible. As Merleau-Ponty puts it, The visible can…fill and occupy me only because I who see it do not see it from the midst of nothingness, but from the midst of itself; I the seer am also visible. What makes the weight, the thickness, the flesh of each colour, of each sound, of each tactile texture, of the present, and of the world, is the fact that he who grasps them feels himself emerge from them by a sort of coiling up or redoubling, fundamentally homogeneous with them, he feels that he is the sensible itself coming to itself.8 These points enable me to complete my outline of Merleau-Ponty’s later philosophy. As we have seen, for him our seeing of a visible object presupposes a

Her analysis builds on the concepts of “emotional labour” and “emotionwork” and “feeling rules” (see also Brooks 2014) which established an entire generation of transnational feminists on a journey of theoretical and empirical work. Pedwell and Whitehead (2012: 121–122) provide a useful summary of her contribution: Hochschild’s work was crucial in contributing to . . . theories of social construction of emotions and later analyses of their performative circula- tion in the context of gendered, classed, racialised and sexualized r…

Evidence for this lack of fit comes from range of sources, from neu­ ral network modeling to detailed studies of action control and perceptual processing. Second, and correlatively, I explore tools for achieving social understanding and social coordination that bypass the propositional atti­ tudes. These range from direct perception of emotions to game-theoretic heuristics (such as tit-for-tat in the iterated prisoner’s dilemma) and what AI theorists term scripts and frames. This introduction has brought out some of the common themes that run through all the chapters. In contrast, the book ends with an afterword that seeks to identify some of the principal avenues for further inquiry. If there is one unifying theme for this volume, it is that the fully concep­ tual understanding that w…

material realm of perception. He more explicitly takes up the question of the lived body in his sub­ sequent work, Phenomenology of Perception (1945), in which he argues that the body is the locus of perception and experience. Pursuant to his objective to analyze the relationship between subjectivity, the body, and the world, Merleau-­Ponty examines specific experiential examples where the body does not fully appear to the subject, even though the subject experiences it as whole, as in the sensation of the phantom limb or the certainty that the back of one’s head exists even though one cannot actually see it.52 This demonstrates the fallibility of conceiving 51 Merleau-­Ponty writes: “the gestures of behavior, the intentions which it [an organism] traces in the space around the animal, are not directed to the true world or pure being, but to being-­for-­the-­animal, that is, to a certain milieu characteristic of the species” or “a

have a tendency to obscure their being alive from themselves; and the idea that these problems are of a political character, because resentment against life is a structuring principle for politics. Agamben’s approach to this Nietzschean problematic begins with an ingenious transposition of the ontological difference onto biological categories, such that the human being appears not just as a being for which being is an issue, but also as an animal for which animality is an issue. This approach, like Nietzsche’s own, is predicated upon the possibility of transformation: the idea that human beings could experience a change in their relation to their lives. Against Nietzsche, however, Agamben’s Pauline concept of redeemed humanity is resolutely non-hierarchical, turning on the possibility of a collective appropriation of our common consignment to unassumable animality. In Chapter 7 I turn to the idea of happiness, working to show what

susceptible to the happy ending than other film genres. Whenever the stability of the family is threatened or rendered dysfunctional in horror art, individual members of the family unit itself frequently display a gen- der ambiguity that is reflective of and generated by disruptions to the unit. In The Powers of Horror, Julia Kristeva associates this kind of ambiguity with what she terms “abjection” because traditional familial boundaries and borders are not respected by whatever source “disturbs identity, system, order” (4). The degree to which such gender destabilization becomes monstrous is dependent on the corre- sponding degree in the breakdown in the family structure itself. The films consid- ered in this chapter offer interesting evidence of gender abjection as a means for terrors from within | 123

Kristeva however chose to name that place without language the semiotic chora (a term taken from Plato). It is ‘a non-­expressive (i.e. non verbal) totality underlying language, a non spatial, non temporal receptacle of energy and drives which she calls the chora’ (Smith, 1998, p. 121). The subject is expelled from the chora in a series of pulsations into the symbolic realm. To return to signifiance, the term Barthes used to describe a different kind of meaning within the text, Kristeva described it as an excess of meaning created by the co-­presence of the semiotic and the symbolic. Some confusion can arise in this instance, as Kristeva chose to reinterpret ‘semiotic’ here to refer to ‘a sort of corporeal memory, a reminiscence of the play of energy and drives experienced in the body with great intensity before the separation from the mother and the foundation of consciousness, entry into the symbolic’ (Smith, 1998, p. 16).

S A N D R A L E E B A R T K Y Unlike men, women have multiple sex organs (e.g. breasts), hence multiple possibilities of satisfaction, not all of which are orgasmic. This is captured in lrigaray's image of the two labia - The Two Lips that Speak Together, always touching (Irigaray, 198 5b). As Irigaray associates phallocratic constructions of sexuality with the linearity and rationality of male discourse, proper attention paid to the specificity of the female body will prepare the way for an authentic articulation of female experience - nonlinear, and not necessarily rational, at least as "rational" has traditionally been understood. In "Breasted experience" (in 1 990b), Iris Marion Young follows Irigaray in claiming that women's sexuality is importantly different from men's and that it offers pleasures unique to women. Male culture fetishizes women's breasts: the " 'best'…

The real is the immediately visible, and this visible does not appear to be a form of representation. Such is the work of myth. The mechanism of myth is the way that habitual representations tangle themselves up in everyday objects and practices so that these ideological meanings come to seem natural, the common-sense reality of that object or practice. There are therefore two systems of meaning: the denotative and the connotative, the ‘object-language’ (the film, the toy, the meal, the car, inasmuch as they signify), and the myth which attaches itself to it, which takes advantage of the form of this denota­ tive language to insinuate itself. In Barthes’s famous example, there is a magazine cover, showing a black soldier saluting the French flag. This photo has one fully adequate denotative meaning (‘Here’s a black sol­

Bringing such notions to bear makes for a poli- tics that is real without being speculative, enriching both new theories of things and feminist discourses. These feminisms undertake an important political function. Re- directing feminism from a paradigm of personal visibility toward what Elizabeth Grosz calls the impersonal politics of imperceptibility,17 object- oriented feminism shifts its operational agencies from a “poli- tics of recognition,” of standing out, to a politics of immersion, of being with. Following Grosz, imperceptibility supplants the Hegelian frame- work of reciprocal identity formation that concerns “the becoming of being” and is inseparable from individuation and subjecthood, with a Nietzschean model in which active, self- modifying forces unfurl,

and developed by Butler; her expanded notion of gender, and understanding of identity and sexuality, is ‘performatively produced and compelled by regulatory practices of gender coherence’, which contrasts with Winterson’s versions of gender, sexuality and identity as being free-floating and dependent on the situations encountered in life.96 However, this study makes use of Butler’s perceptions of gender and sexuality, particularly her proposition that identity should not be separated from the discussion of gender as ‘it would be wrong to think that the discussion of “identity” ought to proceed prior to a discussion of gender identity’.97 For this reason, the following chapters draw upon Butler’s notions of performativity in respect to gender, sexuality and identity, which ‘is not a singular act, but a repetition and a ritual, which achieves its effects through its naturalizati…

unease emphasised in these novels in relation to a context of global neoliberalism. Thus, integral to these fictions is a critique of neoliberal politics and society, which figures the genre of crisis as aesthetically crucial. As Lauren Berlant remarks, crisis offers a way of understanding dominant social anxieties, which ‘imprint on dignity, resilience, desire, or optimism’ (Berlant, 2011, p. 25). It promises a challenge to existing modes of social thinking, precisely by registering the intimate hold that crisis has on contemporary social relations, in particular with respect to self-doubt, insecurity and anxiety occasioned by contemporary global life. In this way, however paradoxically, it paves the way for new modes of cosmopolitan thinking. As Graham Swift remarks, ‘it is when one finds oneself in the middle of the crisis that one feels the need to talk about what happens…

From the Freudian drive he extracts jouissance. Why does he abandon the Freudian language of the drive? In my opinion, he abandons it because he, Lacan, elaborated the drive as a demand. This is what is present in the most classic texts of Lacan's teaching, to which one refers by priority-and with good reason-like "The direction of the cure" or "The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire," where we find Lacan's big graph. What are the stages, of the construction of this big graph, which we use as reference?

It is when Harville tries to describe the love of a sailor for his wife and family ashore—speaking ‘only of such men as have hearts!’ as he presses his own with emotion—that Anne is driven by the logic of debate and of her love for Wentworth to concede the point and to make, while composure lasts, an assertion of love undying: ‘Oh!’ cried Anne eagerly, ‘I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you, and those who resemble you.

–––– (1980) Pouvoirs de l’horreur. Paris: Éditions du Seuil. (English version, 1982, Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection, trans. Leon S. Roudiez, New York: Columbia University Press.) After nearly a decade of writing very dense and abstruse academese, Kristeva began writing in a new, more poetic and open style. This was her ﬁrst book-length excursion into this kind of writing – and it makes for a very good read. The subject matter of the book is the process of abjection, the process by which a child who is still in the imaginary realm begins to expel from itself (physically and psychically) what it decides is not part of its own clean and proper self. This is the way the child begins to develop a sense of a discrete “I,” rather than remaining part of an undifferentiated semiotic chora. Abjection begins in early childhood and it continues throughout one’s life. What is abject is never…

As an essayist, she builds here on what she learned from writing realist, historical novels, which required that she focus on the particular. She places blame for failures of understanding on how photography functions in specific situations, not on the medium itself. Images of suffering, she says, “cannot be more than an invitation to pay attention, to reflect, to learn, to examine the rationalizations for mass suffering offered by established powers” (117). Certainly, one inspira…

Psychoanalysis itself and desire: pages of analysis beckon on this topic, insofar as Derrida’s writings are concerned. To limit ourselves to just one example: in Archive Fever, psychoanalysis emerges as a thinking of the archive which struggles to detach itself securely from the desired object of its thought – which is to say, the object of its desire. (Psychoanalysis, then, is irreducibly both archivo-analysis and archive fever.) In one respect, psychoanalysis’s desires cannot be read outside of the psychoanalytic interpretation of desire – although equally, the always supplementary force of desire means that the analysis of psychoanalytic desire cannot remain confined within the framework of a neat parallel between pyschoanalysis’s desires, on the one hand, and the psycho-

For plausible reasons, the Artwork essay has been understood-and has been used-as both condensation and emblem of what Benjamin's ad- mirers find most typical of his intellectual style: a familiarity with, and active interest in, the cultural phenomena of his own time; an awe- inspiring depth of historical knowledge; a fascination with "facts" in all of their factual bluntness; a passion for the joy of speculation re- mindful of the great protagonists of German Idealism; a commitment to political causes of the Left that does not narr…

The discourse generated from this perspective is cir- cular and thus makes writing on female pleasure ‘often prematurely emitted, makes him miss . . . what her own pleasure might be all about’ (91). Arguments for repro- ductive rights, protection against violence and the right to same-sex marriages have all been ﬁghts against patri- archy. Performativity: feminist queer theorist Judith Butler utilises performativity to theorise the ‘doing of gender’ as a way to understand subjectivity. In her book Gender Trouble (1990) Butler argues that ‘gender is not a noun, neither is it a set of free-ﬂoating attributes . . . gender is performa- tivity produced and compelled by the regulatory practices of gender coherence. Gender is always doing . . . ’ Further- more, gender identity is the expression of performing gen- der and nothing more than this (25). Butler makes clear in her preface to Bodies that Matter (1994) that gender is not performed in the sense of something that is donned

In viewing poetry this way, we are able to reconceive of philosophy’s task anew, for, once again, the two move in relation to one another, and, to- gether, bring the human subject back to its originary fracture. In his own words, Agamben seeks to realize this task as a profound summons emanat- ing from within. As he asks, “Are we capable of reckoning with the poetic pre sen ta tion of the vocation that, as a nonpresupposed princi ple, emerges only where no voice calls us?”111 Whereas theology had once attempted to fi ll in the gap separating art from myth with its messianic proclamations, and promised to deliver humanity from the scission at its core, poetry, in its ephemeral pre sen ta tion of the split itself, off ers another way to encounter the human being, one beyond theology, unique in its ability to si mul ta-

capture conﬁgurations of scopic desire that at once reference and go beyond the simple mechanism of looker and looked-at and – by extension – the limiting subject–object model of relationality on which traditional theories of pornography and spectatorship rest. Theories that contend that there is no properly ‘feminine gaze’, originating with Mulvey’s celebrated 1975 article, are well known in cinema studies. According to Mulvey, in classic narrative cinema, the viewer occupies a masculine position; he is aligned with the agency and desire of the onscreen male hero. The position of femininity, on the other hand, is a matter of embodiment rather than subjectivity: the woman on screen connotes what Mulvey terms ‘to-be-looked-at-ness’.19 This theoretical model, designed to describe mainstream narrative cinema has obvious resonances with some of the anti-porn feminist accounts discussed at th…

point of view. A telling reversal takes place later in the novel, when Robert expects a photo of Albertine to reveal her as a stunning and wonderful beauty, and is stupefied to see that she appears so ordi­ nary: how, he asks himself, could the friend he admires have been so powerfully struck by her? Saint-​Loup has trouble hiding his as­ tonishment, and Marcel recognizes that “the difference between our respective impressions of the same person” was as great as in the earlier case of Rachel.33 Here, he seems to regard their divergent perspectives as fundamentally irreconcilable, having ceased to give priority to the cynical view or the charitable one. To each mind, there corresponds a different world.34 The lesson is one that Marcel finds it difficult to learn, as evidenced by his youthful belief that his parents must “experience the same emotions,” feeling the same way as he himself does—​about his be­ loved hawthorn blossoms, or about his encounter with Odette at

51 Vision in the flesh The body of the Cartesian subject is experienced by introspection or the capacity to reflect on one’s feelings, desires and perceptions. By way of contrast, Merleau-Ponty turns the contents of consciousness outwards, into a consciousness of one’s body that is experienced as a postural schema or the perception of a bodily orientation in relationship to the world. Similarly, the perception of others and the sharing of perceptual experience is possible, not because the bodies of others are recognisable as projections of one’s own body, but because they have a perceivable comportment and intentionality as relationships that are translatable between bodies. As the schema within which the subject can be articulated in the world, the experience of embodiment becomes the horizon of possibility for all intersubjective and objective relations. The bodies of others are not ob…

unconscious desire. Why do I stress Lacan’s well-known assault on the role of the image here? Well, because there is an echo in Lacan’s terms of critique that must not escape us. Psychology is time and again attacked for its objectify- ing qualities, and much the same is alleged of the self-objectifying ego’s captivation in images. Psychology itself is thus likened to the ego, viewed, indeed, as itself as egoic. We may take this argument further by consider- ing the elementary features of Lacan’s mirror-stage. The mirror stage involves the imaginary dynamics of the subject looking at, and as intrigued by, an image that they subsequently come to take on as themselves (as the basis of their ideal-ego). Such an image gives the subject an illusory sense of substantiality and identity; it affirms them in a persistent relation of misrecognition (méconnaissance); it enables them to be…

So, there are perverse modalities of life, and even instances of anti-life, but each of these has to be thought of as permutations (or modalities) of life itself. As the concept of life is not unified (vitalism as a monism articulates the multifold dimensions of life), we have to be able to distinguish among modalities of life to make clear what constitutes its destructive form, and what its more affirmative directions. It seems clear that some normative values are built into the very notion of life that Braidotti formulates; to reiterate, they include interconnectedness, dynamism, becoming, affirmation, and experimentation. When any of us do these things or find that our own action has been initiated by any number of inhuman or posthuman processes, we are in the midst …

come: empathy remains a ‘wish feeling’, in which subjects ‘feel’ something other than what another feels in the very moment of imagining they could feel what another feels.9 The impossibility of feeling the pain of others does not mean that the pain is simply theirs, or that their pain has nothing to do with me. I want to suggest here, cautiously, and tentatively, that an ethics of responding to pain involves being open to being affected by that which one cannot know or feel. Such an ethics is, in this sense, bound up with the sociality or the ‘contingent attach- ment’ of pain itself. Much of the thinking on pain, however, contrasts the ungraspability of the other’s pain with the graspability of my own pain. Elaine Scarry makes this contrast in her analysis of pain and torture (1985: 4). Certainly, there is something ungraspable about the other’s pain, and this is not just because I do not feel it. But my pain, even when I feel it, is not

nomic and social developments of late capitalism (for example, the breakup of the labor movement, globalization, and the homework econ- omy) have resulted in exceedingly complex stratiﬁcations among women nationally and internationally which cannot be grasped solely in terms of gender relations. More to the point, the breakup of women as a coherent group is attributable to feminism itself: feminism is a political movement that has striven to unite women in a struggle for freedom largely by refut- ing the naturalized femininity on which the illusion of a given, common identity of women is based. Rather than willfully destroy the category of women, then, thinkers like Butler, Mouffe, and Scott tried to clarify—in deeply critical and non-nostalgic terms—the political consequences of its historical loss for the future of feminism. Trying to understand the pathos of the category of women debates, I began to think it might be symptomatic of the epistemological framework

Part of her argument has to do with the consequences of image-over- load in photographs depicting suffering. After World War II, the first photographs from the Nazi death camps had great impact—certainly on her as a teenager, she reports. But, she insists,

I was looking at the hyacinth, and as I gazed at the form of its petals and the strength of their curve as they open and curl back to reveal the mysterious ﬂower-centres with their anthers and eye-like hearts, abruptly I found that I was no longer looking at it, but was it; a distinct, indescribable, but in no way vague, still less emotional, shift of consciousness into the plant itself. Or rather I and the plant were one and indistinguishable; as if the plant were a part of my consciousness. I dared scarcely to breathe, held in a kind of ﬁne attention in which I could sense

Donna Haraway’s work on technoculture brings together the fields of sf and science studies. She situates her work at “the cultural space hinted by the intersections of science fiction, speculative futures, feminist and antiracist theory, and fictions of science” (Haraway 1991b: 24) and frequently uses sf examples in her critiques. She exposes the gendered and racial assumptions shaping primatology (1989), while “A Manifesto for Cyborgs” (1985, revised as “A Cyborg Manifesto” (1991b)) has arguably been the most influential essay for sf scholarship about new models of subjectivity. Haraway considers the gene, the fetus, and race as three of the most important objects of knowledge in current science practice and theory, and traces them through “knowledge-making practices, industry and commerce, popular culture, social struggles, psychoanalytic formations, bodily histories, human and nonhuman actions,

We begin with an interview between Mark Fisher and political the- orist Jodi Dean, in which they discuss capitalist realism’s potential as a theoretical tool. Their different positions on the affective dimen- sion of capitalism, in particular, are useful in theorizing how capital- ism becomes viewed as an inevitable (“irresistible”) force rather than a socially and politically transformable one. Dean emphasizes the rewards and gratifications capitalism offers; Fisher, the attachment between circuits of pleasure and boredom. With capitalist realism, for Fisher, “we’re faced with an entertainment that doesn’t really en- tertain alongside a populism which really isn’t popular.” The homo- g…

Thus, the regimes of sovereignty and biopower are entirely distinct in their paradigmatic structure, which of course has never prevented their admixture in actual practices of the modern state, which Foucault has famously labelled a ‘demonic project’ (Foucault 1988d, 71. See also Burchell 1991; Hindess 1996b). On the ontological level, what is demonic about this project is its uncanny coupling of absolutely incommensurable elements: the negative and the positive, the transcendent and the immanent, scarcity and plenitude, etc. On the ontic level, the demonic nature of the modern state is owing to the conﬂuence of the murderous power of the sovereign’s sword and the productive, vitalist power of biopolitics. The modern state is thus a monstrous unison of the executioner and the physician. While this monstrosity is traditionally illustrated by the experience of the ‘totalitarian’ projects of German Nazism and Soviet Stalinism (see Foucault 2003; Prozorov 2006a), we may easily

Given the novel’s status as a national mnemonic symbol, scholars have related it to its ideological, social-historical, and cultural contexts. My interests in this book lie elsewhere, for I am primarily in- trigued by what might be called the Brontë effect of the Jane Eyre legacy. This expression refers to Shoshana Felman’s analysis of the Poe-etic ef- fect that Edgar Allan Poe’s short story ‘The Purloined Letter’ (1844) has had on literary criticism. Felman states that the critical discourse about Poe is one of the most visible effects of his short story, in particular, of its poetic signiﬁ er.

The cyborg has been used for very many purposes in feminist theories—so many that it has lost some of its critical power. Haraway has commented on the way in which her cyborg ﬁgure caught the imagination of her many readers, and she emphasizes that “as an oppositional ﬁgure the cyborg has a rather short half-life, and indeed for the most part, cyborg ﬁgurations, both in technical and in popular culture, are not, and have never been, oppositional, or liberatory, or had a critical dimension in the sense that I use critique, i.e., in the sense that things might be otherwise” (cited in Lykke,

and effective in controlling populations. In this way Foucault presents an origin (the panopticon was a genuinely new mechanism) that is free of metaphysics. A third important feature of Discipline and Punish speaks to the advances of poststructuralism over traditional critical theory. In his analysis, Foucault integrates with critical theory the new sense of the importance of language. The depiction of the panopticon includes not only an institutional framework and a system of practices but also a set of discourses. These discourses consist of the Enlightenment reform¬ ers' tracts advocating the abolition of torture and the writings of Bentham and others proposing the basic form of the panopticon. It includes as well the records kept by the administrators of the prisons and by the police. Especially interesting, however, is the role of the discourse of the new science of criminology in the legitimation of the

She is famous for her theory of performativity and for her political thoughts on precariousness and grievability, enabling nuanced explorations of gender and love, especially for marginalised identities. In Gender Trouble (1990; second edition 1999 with a new preface), Butler applies insights from Foucault and Derrida to argue that, contrary to popular thinking, biological assumptions about sex are not “given,” but constructed and naturalised, just as much as cultural gender roles, in ac- cordance with the needs of a society to regulate itself in discursive ways. Butler did not share the enthusiasm of différance feminists about access to multiplici- ties of meaning prior to discursive signification. She realised that these multi- plicities would amount to a constitutive “outside” to social-discursive con- structions that she, fol…

please a woman and to be preferred by her to other men.”33 In short, the man who dreams of conquering the world wants to do so in order to access his erotic object. Here, the desire for mastery is nothing but the disguised articulation of another desire—the desire occasioned by the impossible object. The desire for mastery is itself never primary but always the displace- ment of another desire. If we think of desire in terms of mastery, we submit ourselves to the subject’s own self-deception. In Lacan’s conception of desire, the gaze is not the vehicle through which the subject masters the object but a point in the Other that resists the mastery of vision. It is a blank spot in the subject’s look, a blank spot that threatens the subject’s sense of mastery in looking because the subject cannot see it directly or successfully integrate it into the rest of its visual field. This is because…

The appearance in 1985 of The Body in Pain constituted one of the most stunning academic debuts in memory; the book remains today one of the most formidable, ambitious, and original works to have been produced

Instead of following the established path of other noise re- searchers (Kahn, Kosko, Hegarty, Hainge, Schwartz, along with Frances Dyson, Benjamin Halligan, Salomé Voegelin, Joanna Demers, Brandon LaBelle, Jacques Attali, and others), I sought, in applying indeterminate and cut-up methods, to establish a novel line of noise research to see what might possibly be learned from a noisy noise project, from a textual experiment that went beyond my individual control or intention and thus beyond what I could potentially conceive about noise without the assistance of the methods. nnnnnn To further develop the methodology, I brought together examples and forerunners in alternative and avant- garde knowledge production.

writes, against Levinas: ‘the true ethical step is the one beyond the face of the other, the one of suspending the hold of the face, the one of choosing against the face, for the third. This coldness is justice at its most elemen­ tary.’ (Ibid., p. 50) I will not take a stance here on whether Žižek’s assess­ ment of Levinas is accurate—although I can say that I do think he touches a blind-spot in Levinas’ thought. Nevertheless, I do not think Žižek’s statement can sidestep the crucial question of the impasse of reason, namely the challenge of how we avoid justice being simply an arbitrary stipulation of a particular power-discourse—and thereby constitute jus­ tice as privileging, that is, as unjust. So, while it might be true that we must leave behind Levinas’ conception of the I-you relationship in order to reach the meaning of ethics, I nevertheless contend that it is only thr…

Another bias of this book is that it addresses the condition of love more markedly from the standpoint of women than of men, and more especially from the standpoint of those women who opt largely for marriage, reproduction, and middle-class life- styles. As I hope to show here, it is the combination of these aspira- tions and their location in a free market of sexual encounters which creates new forms of emotional domination of women by men. This means then that although this book is relevant to many women, it is obviously not relevant to all of them (certainly not to lesbians, women who are not interested in domesticity, married or unmarried, or in children).

In many ways, this is precisely what cinema is for Deleuze: it is a machine for going back into the past. For the movement-image, going back into the past is a way of fixing what happened in the past, of being certain about it, and thus of making clear connections between the past and the present. For the time-image, by contrast, one goes back into the past, but one is uncertain what one will find there, and the past will prove to be changeable and—perhaps even more provocatively—open to invention. I have argued that La signora di tutti provides an example of a movement-image rather than a time-image. And yet, some aspects of the time-image may well be present there; that is, some aspects of …

MEDIA TEMPORALITIES 43 conceptualization, of image making, is undertaken by apparatuses involving televisions, cinemas and cameras. According to Flusser, these complex ‘playthings’, these processes that code ways of looking, are so complex that those playing with them, no matter how long they play with them, remain unable to plumb their depth. The game consists of combinations of the symbols contained within programmes. The player, the human user, the photographer, the television owner, the cinema goer, becomes a functionary within this system. He tries to learn the apparatus’ rules and eventually learns to think through them. Flusser sees this happening in all electronic communication and imaging, but ﬁ rst works his theory through the apparatus of photography. In doing this, we get to see one of the novelties in his approach: he uses the language of computers – programme a…

Take, for example, that which we are now doing, drinking, singing, and talking-these actions are not in themselves either good or evil, but they tum out in this or that way according to the mode of performing them; and when well done they are good, and when wrongly done they are evil; and in like manner not every kind ofloving nor every Love is noble and worthy of praise, but only that which inspires man to love nobly. The Love who is the offspring of the common Aphrodite is essentially common, and has no discrimination, being such as moves the meaner sort of men.

necessary; to recall, she states that “language can be given to us only by means of . . . negotiation with the mother because language is nothing other than the fruit of that negotiation” (46; my emphases). But, one might reply, surely in fact we learn to speak from our mothers only because, in contingent fact, we have historically had a social division of labor that allocates the care of young children primarily or exclusively to women, while reserving the higher-ranked spheres of public work and politics for men. This gender division of labor has been bound up with the hierarchical division between public and private spheres and, in turn, with the symbolic divisions between civilization and nature, word and body—divisions that Muraro contests. Yet this suggests that the mother has her symbolic authority in teaching us language only under a symbolic order that denies her tha…

should always be adequate to a particular problem. In this case, it is clear that Foucault’s problem lies elsewhere than that of psychoanalysis, strictly speaking, and, in The History of Sexuality that is on the relationship between knowledge and power, as a technique or how of power, understood through the concept of biopolitics. This knowledge(s)—that is in itself incomplete though presented as full representations—have served, Foucault believes, as techniques of power intervening in the management of populations and effectuating forms of subjectification. This is not to say that knowledge “comes first,” that is, that power merely receives knowledge and applies it in a linear process of production. Rather, as Deleuze explains in his work on

Returned to the Archimedes Palimpsest, we come full circle in this brief history of palimpsests from antiquity to the present. This is both a vitally suggestive substrate for the rest of this study, and, I hope, of practical use, in that it brings together for the ﬁrst time in one place the many disparate English-language sources that provide information regarding palimpsests. In any case, I close by echoing Tregelles’ apology from a century and a half ago: Some into whose hands this volume may come, will possibly ask for a deﬁnition of what is meant by a Palimpsest MS. Those who are familiar with such terms will excuse what may seem superﬂuous to them in such a point being stated. (1861, p. xxi) A Brief History of Palimpsests 21

relates. There is, for Lacan, an object of desire, which is the object through which the subject tries to realize its desire. This is what desire seeks. But there is also the lost object that causes the subject to desire, an object that Lacan christens the objet petit a or objet a.16 In order to highlight this object’s irreducibility to the signifier, Lacan insisted that translators leave it untranslated. It indicates the point of absence that arouses our desire because we associate it with a lost enjoyment that we are incapable of finding present anywhere in the world. No empirical object provides this enjoyment, but the objet a suggests its possibility to us. The objet a takes on different forms. The objet a in the visual field is the gaze, and in the aural field it is the voice. These are the two forms of the object that Lacan adds to Freud’s list of sexual objects. For F…

When the woman looks LINDA WILLIAMS Whenever the movie screen holds a particularly effective image of terror, little boys and grown men make it a point of honor to look, while little girls and grown women cover their eyes or hide behind the shoulders of their dates. There are excellent reasons for this refusal of the woman to look, not the least of which is that she is often asked to bear witness to her own powerlessness in the face of rape, mutilation and murder. Another excellent reason for the refusal to look is the fact that women are given so little to identify with on the screen. Laura Mulvey’s extremely inﬂuential article on visual pleasure in narrative cinema has best deﬁned this problem in terms of a dominant male look at the woman that leaves no place for the woman’s own pleasure in seeing: she exists only to be looked at.1 Like the female spectator, the female protagonist often fails to look, to return the gaze of

The long list of critical articles that work with Scarry’s discussion of pain and silence include Schweizer, “To Give Suffering a Language”; Boureau, “Pain and the Un- making of Self”; and McKim, “Making Poetry of Pain.” 15. In The Language of Pain, Biro redefines pain as “an all-consuming interior experi- ence that threatens to destroy everything except itself and can only be described through metaphor” (75).

er’s opinion, thus “a non-­philosophical attempt to think about the world-­ without-­us philosophically” (9). My approach to the Gothic, which draws inspiration from Thacker’s, adopts a similar tack in its consideration of how the Gothic, including its intersections with what Thacker refers to as horror, insistently thematizes the connections of the human to the nonhuman, invest- ing these relationships with dread. That dread then is an important obstacle to be confronted when attempting to think how best to negotiate the challenges of the Anthropocene. Whereas Thacker is concerned with how horror lets us address limitations on human thought—it is about the “paradoxical thought of the unthinkable” (9)—my argument is that the Gothic genre lets us contem- plate a world in which the human holds no privileged place. I should add that the constellation of theoretical approaches I’m calling Thing Theory that serves as the starting point for this project has received its

Yet, as Freud goes on to argue, the pres- ent undeniable nature of death is hardly detrimental. On the con- trary, it allows life to become signiﬁ cant again for the very reason that its mortality is fully acknowledged. Certainly experiencing death vividly entails the stark recognition of one’s own possible demise,

Introduction In Literature and Evil, Georges Bataille wrote that the base of the erotic instinct could only form itself in the inhuman conditions of a prison; therefore, Marquis de Sade was able to write Les Cent Vingt Journées de Sodome (One Hundred and Twenty Days of Sodomy) locked up in the Bastille. This base of eroticism for Bataille and others who followed in his think- ing issued forth from a clear and distinct consciousness. In this work, I attempt to reconceive the erotic, its imaginative manifestations and an aesthetic which is ultimately brought about through desire’s disruption. Essentially, I take Ba- taille’s notion that “consciousness of desire is hardly acces- sible: desire alone alters the clarity of consciousness, but it is above all the possibility of satisfaction that suppresses it” and extend it to include the idea that since (using Bataille’s

One of this book’s central claims is that the present is perceived, first, affectively: the present is what makes itself present to us before it becomes anything else, such as an orchestrated collective event or an epoch on which we can look back. (Chapter 2, “Intuitionists,” describes this way of thinking about “the affective present” in Marxist critical theory.) If the present is not at first an object but a mediated affect, it is also a thing that is sensed and under constant revision, a temporal genre whose conventions emerge from the personal and public filtering of the situations and events that are happening in an extended now whose very parameters (when did “the present” begin?) are also always there for debate.3 Disc…

voice to the experiences of the many that have been excluded from the canon of Western epistemology. It has also reclaimed the sensory con- nections and cosmic scope of Indigenous cosmologies. However, there are also blockages in decolonial critique. A new cosmopolitanism will not be founded if it is confined to destigmatiz- ing the status of the cultures of the South and expanding the range of cosmological perspectives. It is not sufficient to expose the dehuman- izing effects of the colonial mindset, it is also necessary to outline the platform for cross-cultural dialogue. When such an alternative model of exchange and valuation is developed, it is also crucial that we avoid falling back into the double bind of normative cosmopolitanism. We cannot go back to an idealized state of pre-colonial isolation. The world has become too messy. Cultures overlap. People are on the move.…

the case that hauntings, the uncanny, the dead appear to us in surprising ways and become part of our current social projects. They become what Derrida has called our ‘spectral politics’ of landscape. This book examines the relationship between historical practices such as archaeology and archival work in order to think about how the social landscape is reinvented time and time again with reference to the ghosts of the past. It examines the literary and historical status and accounts of the ghost, not only for what they might tell us about themselves but about their significance for our, constantly re-invented, re-vivified, re-ghosted social world. Haunted houses, slave ghosts, the spectres of animals haunt our imaginations but they are more than fabrications and fictions – they are very much part of our social practice. The book aims to uncover the significance of the ‘social ghost’ and…

by the requirements of prudence and justice. Justice is not simply a relation between anonymous citizens. It bears on our treatment of the Other as well. This is one of several reasons why no sharp distinction between ethics and politics can be sustained, a topic we shall be returning to in our Conclusion. For Derrida as for Levinas, Otherness is a matter of absolute singularity, ‘inaccessible, solitary, transcendent, non-manifest . . .’.26 Solitary, because while ethics is a matter of right relations between oneself and others, it is not in the Realists’ view a question of sharing one’s life with them. As far as that goes, ethical Realism is as anti-social as the Kant whose gigantic bulk continues to overshadow it. In good, old-fashioned, deontological style, such an ethics bears on our obligations to others, not our enjoyment of them. Otherness here is not primarily the g…

essay momentarily in his Homo Sacer, Agamben draws out its specifically political ramifications.21 Our point is that the very existence of such antithetical meanings holds implications not only for linguistics, hermeneutics, and psychoanalysis but also for biopolitics, democracy, and government. The Freudian unconscious, with its peculiar absence of negation, has signif- icant bearing on politics independent of any political actor’s subterranean motives or duplicity. Rancière numbers Agamben as among the covert haters of democracy, and he certainly has no time for Freud. Nevertheless, in Hatred of Democracy he is doing something similar with the antithetical meanings of dêmos, albeit without the etymological heroics or the totalizing ambition that mark the Homo Sacer project. Rancière formulates the antithetical meanings of dêmos in the following terms: Popular sovereignty is a way of including democratic excess, of

Metz - by going in a startling new and feminist direction (Metz 197 4). Mulvey figures cinema as irreducibly shaped by sexual difference, arguing that film is constructed around looks or gazes, which in turn shape editing and narrative, and, further, that these looks are com- pletely and eternally those of men looking at women. As the art historian John Berger had recently and succinctly pointed out 'men act and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at' (Berger 1972, p. 47). Mulvey's essay marked a huge conceptual leap in film theory: a jump from the ungendered and for- malistic analyses of semiotics to the understanding that film viewing always involves gendered identities. Hugely influential as it was, critics, nevertheless did attack the essay's apparent ahistorical, totalising construction and, as a result, Mulvey went on substantially to revise her assessment in later work (Cowie

it becomes quite evident that the concept of “woman” was pushed toward its very eccentricity much less by the “dom- inant” figure of the male, who may have achieved this in a malign action of strategic exclusion, than by the woman’s magnetic satellite or eccenter, the girl. The girl bypasses the gender binary. She highlights, if not creates, the asymmetric position of the female in relation to the male. This is why the girl is a great point of departure when issues surrounding gender have to get revised, analyzed, fought, or undone. In this respect, I follow Luce Irigaray’s argument that the “woman” must be considered through the “modalities” of mother and daughter, and I agree as well that a strong emphasis must be placed on the intergenerational factor as a logical pre- requisite that works like a bond or (affective) link. Luce Irigaray’s intuitions regarding this topic have been quite precise. Irigaray’s stroke of genius was to have supposed

Deleuze also captured this interplay under the umbrella term of the sensorimotor schema in three concepts: 2.3 The Action Image as Tactile Cinema

writing of recent years. There are two seminal texts in the ongoing history of cyborgs and cyberspace that are not included in this Reader, but which nevertheless require some comment, not least because of their continuing impact on both feminist and cultural theory. The provocative metaphor of the cyborg was first used by Donna Haraway in her essay, 'A Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s', published in 1985. In the essay, she employs the metaphor in order to argue, firstly, for a reconsideration of Marxist and feminist analyses of the social relations of science and technology which rely on a received model of domination and subordination and, secondly, for the development of an innovative socialist-feminist political strategy that is not dependent on totalising theories and in which the formation of new and unexpected alliances an…

seemed the obvious place to begin our interrogation: after all, Derrida’s central metaphor in Specters of Marx is the ghost of Hamlet’s father, and Derrida’s exploration of hauntology has a distinctive theatrical dimen- sion. In this book, we make a case for the particular advantages of putting spectrality and theatre studies in dialogue and we stress the illu- minating ways in which plays and performance can be newly analysed and understood through a focus on tropes of the ghostly and represen- tations of haunting. The historical frame for Theatre and Ghosts stretches from eighteenth-century Gothic drama to current agendas of the spec- tral. World War I and World War II, not to mention the other numerous wars, genocides, natural disasters and acts of terrorism in recent times, have proliferated the device of the ghost in all media, and on stage the ghost of more modern times is …

IO Chapter One our perception of it a dualism: by trying to use the mind to control the pained body, we reinforce the mind's estrangement from the body. And in so dOing, we invoke a complex series of confusions about the way we think about the body. These confusions become particularly acute for the late eighteenth century, in which the pleasurable perception of others' pain was colliding with the distressing perception of one's own odious pain. The dualism that Scarry suggests exists in pain can be read as part of a Romantic dualism of self-perception, one that depends upon nociception at the same time that it tries to eradicate it. I want now to turn to a more linear analysis of the history of nociception and discuss its implications for Romantic modes of thinking about the body. As pain manifests itself at the turn of the nineteenth century, we can ask Eagleton's question…

Cine- matic modernity has opposed to the movement-image a different way of organizing the image and of organizing the relationship between the image and time, the 'time-image7. Deleuze is unique among philosophers of the late twentieth century in having written systematically on cinema. Deleuze is not what we now call a 'film theorist', nor is he a film critic. He neither taught film nor did he write film reviews. He watched films and he thought about them, in the light of theoretical debates on cinema in France, often originating in the journal Cahiers du Cinema. French film historians and critics developed a problem of cinematic moder-

ments, and events. The sonic realm is distinguished by an immersive, mul- tidirectional, nonhomogeneous openness. Acoustic imagination knows no boundaries: you can hear a wall or a room; you can create spaces that do not exist; sound signals a breakdown, a welcomed posthuman turn away from language. Finally, sound’s relationship to computational art and cul- ture is far from new. However, the proliferation of digital media has played a critical role in further developing alternative ideas of the relationship between sound, body, space, and machine. The Rhythmic Event explores this sonic dimension and the dynamic engagement that it affords with the speculative and potential aspects of the event. A central question for the book is whether recent new media art experiments—particularly what falls under the broader sonic realm—can suggest alternative modes of perception, temporality,…

new object of belief. For Irigaray, sexual difference (in her early work, woman) takes the place of Feuerbach’s “subjectivity”; thus she calls for female divinities that will serve as the support of feminine subjectivity. Although she understands sexual difference as the mark of mortality itself, its structural position within her work leads to the reiﬁcation of sexual difference and, paradoxically, to the potential evasion of mortality, limitation, and particularity.

structure of the Lacanian symbolic.13 The notion of the “otherwise” occupies the second kind of inquiry Butler pursues: an interrogation of that “we” who are constituted as sexed and gendered subjects and an asking after the conditions of life on the sexual margins. Butler is interested in expanding the domains of legibility for those who violate the norms of gender and sexuality, and doing so without appeal to a shared sense of identity. That expansion cannot be achieved by simply enumerating a list of gender configurations that might supplement male and female, since such a list would quickly become proscriptive or positivist. Butler wants to secure gender as an open site of as yet unarticulated possibility in order to resist the kind of foundationalism or ontological thralldom that would restrict the realm of the possible to its normative iterations. The task of recognizing gender as it is lived outside norms necessarily entails a holding open or a suspension of

emerge, as a consequence. Disciplinary power is no longer an imper- ative molding in conformity with an a priori moral or ­legal model. It becomes a correctional reuptake mechanism for emergent norma- tive variation. This annexes disciplinary power ­wholesale to bio- power’s regulatory operation. The new tenor of discipline resulting from this Foucault names “normation,” as opposed to “normaliza- tion” (2007, 57). When disciplinary power is annexed in this way to regulatory biopower, the mode of operation of the continuum of power as a ­whole assumes a new cast. Foucault calls this global mode of operation “governmentality.” It is at this point in his logic of interacting regimes of power that Foucault comes around to asking ­whether we are still dealing with natu­ral subjects. Is an economized subject still a natu­ral sub- ject? In The Birth of Biopolitics (2008), Foucault’s answer in many passages would on the face of it appear to be no. The neoliberal
