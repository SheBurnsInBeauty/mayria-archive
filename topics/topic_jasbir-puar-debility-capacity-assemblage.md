semantics, and logic are in collapse.”81 With this, the point of the critique of formal and fuzzy logic, as well as phenomenology, comes into view. Let us unpack this a bit more before moving on. Assemblages are molecu- lar or quasimolecular elements. In an assemblage, there are both territories or strata and lines of flight, which are movements of deterritorialization and destratification.82 Each of these, strata and lines of flight, move at measurable speeds: the slowness or viscosity of a strata is stable and makes possible an or- ganism or an organic whole. Semiotically, it is representational and attributable

Thus, while a territorial assemblage may contain an exterior milieu of materi- als, these materials are chosen according to their capacity to form and reinforce an expressive statement as well as their capacity to serve a functional role (figure 28.8). So, one may ask, how does this expressive statement expand within the terri- torial assemblage? If the territory was initiated by an architectural statement, then the developing of this statement forms the basis of “style” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 317). For Deleuze and Guattari, the transition from signature to style is not sim- ply a question of scale: from one expressive quality to an aggregate of multiple expressive qualities. This stage in the infra-assemblage, they argue, also marks the point when expressiveness itself starts to take on an autonomous role in the development of an emerging building-assemblage: “What we wish …

Acknowledgements This work was funded in part by the award of an Arts Faculty Research Grant by the University of Leicester, for which I am grateful. Much of the research I completed as a Research Associate of the American An- tiquarian Society. It is a pleasure to acknowledge the generosity of the Society for making available to me the resources of their library and the expertise of the staff during the period of my research associateship - and after. I wish especially to thank Joanne Chaison and Caroline Sloat for their practical assistance and for their continuing interest in this project. Alan Degutis gave me invaluable computing support, including the construction of bespoke databases, which was certainly above and beyond the call of his duty. Fellow researchers, Neal Salisbury of Smith College, and Barry O'Connell of Amherst College, permitted me unashamedly to pick the…

feature is its stiff construction. Viewed from the vantage of the supposed Moroccan Other, from this perverse, fetishistic position, the cloth of the photographs is not (as it is in the fantasy) the object-cause of desire; it does not beckon us to peer behind it, or to imagine a hideous enjoyment concealed by it. This is why there are no photographs of the unveiling of the figures or, indeed, of any action taken toward them. There is no—or strikingly little—fantasy space in these photographs, that is, no virtual space suggested by the figures. No promise of a future knowledge to which they may provide the key. The photographs are precisely cut off from such a space, which would only be generated if the cloth were to occupy the place of the object a. The cloth is not a presentified image of loss, but rather a solid presence, a barrier against any recognition of loss. If the perverse behol…

emphasise that everything that can be said by analysing assemblages in terms of segments or lines can also be expressed by setting the territorialisation parameter of each assemblage in a nested set to the appropriate value: each composing line could be treated as itself an assemblage, its molar or molecular status defined by its parameter settings. Let’s return to the concept of an assemblage’s diagram. As already argued, the diagram captures the structure of the space of possibilities associated with an assemblage’s variable components, as well as the structure of the space of possible parameter values. These coupled possibility spaces are much like the state space and control space used in the geometric approach to the study of differential equations. One advantage of mapping historical processes using these concepts is that once we understand that the possibilities open to an actual assemblage have a certain virtual

ceptual analysis. We are already in place. Not simply the room I currently write in, but the condition of there being a place at all. How does this room envelop me? How do I hold myself in this room? To what extent will this room become a significant aspect of my future memories? At which point did I cease feeling a visitor in this room and more a fundamental part of it? Such questions for the most part remain dormant, rising to the surface only when places either lose their familiarity or are otherwise destroyed and lost. The complexity surrounding the topic of place is vast, and the aim of this book is to offer a contribution to the body of phenomenological work con- tending with the idiosyncrasies of memory and materiality, of which an im- pressive library is already in existence (Backhaus and Murungi 2005; Behnke 1997; Brown and Toadvine 2003; Carr 1991; Casey 1993, 2000b, 2007; Cresswell 2004; Entrikin 1991; Hayden 1997; Kolb 2008; Light and Smith

an automaton, the elements that the fact-builder wants to spread in time and space is not a black box. It does not act as one’ (SA 131). This provisional, functional unity in relation to a given context is what makes a fact substantial. Given this packaged functionality, “facts now have a vis in- ertia of their own. They seem to move even without people. More fantastic, it seems they would have existed even with- out people at all” (SA 133). Por Latour, the metaphysical work traditionally assigned to substances is now handled by the operational inertia proper to black boxes. On this platform, the term “sub- stance’ names the solid, packaged resistance that is essential to an object’s status as an agent. As the double-bind of resis- tant availability, grace manifests as the enabling strength of an object’s simultaneous movements of making-available and packing-away. The frequent obscurity of grace results, in part, simply from the fact that, in each and every object,

about the scope of traditional conceptual analysis, and sometimes a deferential attitude towards scientific evidence. Be that as it may, there has been no shortage of arguments in favor of 4Dism. Many of them are driven by philosophical reflection on the problems of change, intrinsic properties, temporal predication, material constitution, and vagueness. There has been no shortage of 3Dist responses to those arguments. The ensuing discussions continue to benefit not only direct participants, but various neighboring areas mentioned above. Several excellent review articles cover these grounds in detail. But persistence is a dynamic and rapidly evolving topic, and the debate is changing every day. Recent developments have tended to focus on a set of related issues having to do with parthood and location. It is in this context that broadly empirical considerations are increasingly brought to

which to alter the decaying landscape. The venture of the present book requires facing the unfamiliar yet real zones of the event. That is, it requires conceiving a rhythmicity of the event, where rhythm is not only a concept but also a method with which to account for how the new comes to be. The book suggests that rhythm may be one way humans have of accessing the subsistence of a more “ghostly” or subterranean temporality lurking in the shadows of the actualized digi- tal event. Digital events have been understood primarily through number, where this is taken to mean binary codification and therefore limited pos- sibility. The trouble with this association is that it arises from a generic understanding of number as the grouping of units, representing (symbol- izing) a specific, predecided, and unchangeable thing. My thesis is that the concept of rhythm—detached from this idea …

aspects of them into directional networks. Having, then, banned the One (even if only for method- ological reasons), Latour is committed to both the infinite divisibility and the infinite compoundability of the real. In principle, there can be neither an upper nor a lower limit to the multitude and no one scale, whether micro, macro, or median, can be privileged as more real or original than the others. Indeed, in Latour’s metaphysics, the very project of globally distributing objects into higher or lower strata fails because “there is no global” (PF 220). Strata have, in- stead, only local and conventional importance. For Latour, it is always true that “the small holds the big” and “the big could at any moment drown again in the small” (RS 243). Being awash, however, in the multitude is no disaster for Latour’s project. In explaining and describing the work done by the multitude of objects—a multitude to which we ourselves irrevocably belong—we cannot hope to do better

their originator, he does give a more interesting list than usual. He does not list these features in an actual table, but they are developed from roughly pages 34–40 of A New Philosophy of Society: *Criterion One: an assemblage tends to have retroactive effects on its parts. He credits Bhaskar with this point. In DeLanda’s own words: “although a whole emerges from the interactions among its parts, once it comes into existence it can affect those parts…. In other words…. we need to elucidate…. the macro-micro mechanisms through which a whole provides its component parts with constraints and resources placing limitations on what they can do while enabling novel performances.”88 *Criterion Two: an assemblage may be characterized by “redundant causation.” This second feature of assemblages turns out to create certain tensions for DeLanda’s thought, as will be seen shortly. The basic idea is that the same emergent assemblage might have arisen from any number of

The world of our experience is, indeed, continually and endlessly coming into being around us as we weave. If it has a surface, it is like the surface of the basket: it has no ‘inside’ or ‘outside’. Mind is not above, nor nature below; rather, if we ask where mind is, it is in the weave of the surface itself.And it is within this weave that our projects of making, whatever they may be, are formulated and come to fruition. Only if we are capable of weaving, only then can we make. NOTES 1 These examples are taken from French (1988: 32–36, 117–118, 161), who provides many more. See also Steadman (1979, Chapter 2). 2 To adopt an architectural term, the coherence of the basket is based upon the principle of tensegrity, according to which a system can stabilise itself mechanically by distributing and balancing counteracting forces of compression and tension throughout the structure. Significantly, tensegrity structures are common to both

murdered by Ingram Fizer” (assuming Fizer was really the guilty party)? As explained earlier, my way of handling this situation would not be to talk about pre-existing capacities in the components (Marlowe, Fizer, knife), but about actual properties of the murder as a higher-order object. DeLanda: Yes, I totally agree that this is a problem. I pres­ ently do not know how to solve it, but I agree that if I do not find a principled way of limiting the number of possibili­ ties associated with capacities, then there is a big hole in my ontology. Harman: Capacity metaphysics is hot these days in ana­ lytic philosophy: above all, there’s Nancy Cartwright, and there is also the colorful and late lamented George Molnar from Sydney (Cartwright 1999; Molnar 2003).

the art leads to an increase or decrease in vitality, and whether it lends itself well or poorly to the struggles of those concerned, especially those who have been dispossessed. It is a more relevant framework for the criticism of collab- orative public works with ameliorative goals than that advanced by Bishop (or Bourriaud, for that matter). The attunement to the social level of creativity is the artistic difference that Altaf and her collaborators bring to the table. It sets the Nalpar project apart from the work of NGOs and government agencies involved in development, aid and the provision of basic material necessities. Nalpar is especially inter­ esting because it illustrates how artists, and not scientists, engineers, urban planners, government agencies or corporations, can act as motors for vital social transformation. This is not to dismiss the potential contributions of…

at the notary’s side, or his own mother-in-law and her husband. If, as we suspect, it was his divorce and the loss of his job that turned his life upside-down, then we would expect him to take revenge on those directly responsible. Aurora, however, suppresses the question of causality and responsibility entirely. The ways in which Puiu depicts Viorel interacting with his physi- cal surroundings map his quotidian spatial (non-)strategies. By isolating the character in space, Aurora reveals how Viorel’s performance lacks continuity and cohesion, which shuts off the familiarity necessary for the navigation of social life. The character’s disjointed performances produce the social space he is part of, but of course this relationship is a mutual one: the post-socialist spaces of contemporary Romania delineate the limited performative repertoire available for Viorel as well. The patterns of this common dependency show an aimlessness that is different from

nity of researchers and practitioners as the ﬁeld is getting closer to being a recognized discipline (Koenitz 2018). Together with Mirjam Palosaari Eladhari, I have described some additional challenges, in particular the dependency on legacy analytical frameworks (Groundhog Day), the lack of a shared vocabulary (Babylonian Confusion), the missing institutional memory of the ﬁeld (Amnesia), the absence of established benchmarks (No Yardstick) and the overproduction of uncoordinated and quickly abandoned tools (Sisyphus) (Koenitz and Eladhari 2019). My own contribution to this volume (co-authored with Mirjam Palosaari Elad- hari, Sandy Louchart, Frank Nack, Christian Roth, Elisa Meckler, and Péter Kristóf Makai) describes an effort to solve one of these issues, namely the lack of a shared vocabulary, with a community-authored Encyclopedia of Interactive Narrative as a product of the EU COS…

street. All of the objects are inanimate: they are dead, junk, debris, similar to the elements that make up the construct. The coming to life of these objects means that they had the ability ‘to produce effects’ in the viewer (Bennett 2010: 5). One of the strengths of Bennett’s book is her argument that the power that things have to affect is ‘not entirely reducible to the context in which (human) subjects set them’ (5), thus implicating the effects that objects have on each other outside of human observation or thought. However, Bennett still privileges the network or assemblage of objects inter- acting together, as seen in the collection of debris she sees on the street (Harman 2014: 98). Here is a similar issue as that found in DeLanda: there is no room for essence, the main lesson that Mr Motley provided with his ever-changing form. One of the ways in which the crisis engine is not a network is the way that its three comprising elements are cut off from each other

natural kinds, but are composed of mighty armadas of tiny subcomponents. This is one side of the story, and a good side. But recall that an assemblage is never fully actualized: a machine or a human society not only exceeds our conception of it, but must also exceed any actualization of it. That is to say, it must exceed any relational effect that it has on other portions of the world, given its independence from any particular effects it might have in the world at large. This is the ambivalence described earlier: although an assemblage is formed from components in relation, it is an emergence that exceeds those components. And along with exceeding the reality of its parts, it is also deeper than any outer effects it might have, and might not have any effects at all while still retaining its reality. It is far from clear, for instance, that electoral coalitions exist only in the moment of their fabrication. There may have been several real “McCain victory coalitions“

and needs are made visible. A model shows that it is impossible to imagine a new building without taking into account the adjacent buildings, the adoration of their worshipers, the disagreement of the reformers, the busy traffic of the city, the dense network of the districts, the marks of history, the majesty of the government, the controversies of city politics, the sweet pieties of neighbors’ rela- tionships. Pointing to that particular configuration of elements out of which the new building is meant to emerge, a model also sets the limits of the architects’ capacity for intervention. A model becomes possible only because it can bring under its one “roof” a distinct assembly of parties and weld them together into a new and consistent unit. That is how various types of models become possible: structural models, program models, cir- culation models and the like. A Building Is a “Multive…

destabilize, their elements passing on into new assemblages: the assemblage that is the current North American power grid contains some elements of the 2003 grid but also many new ones. Thus, assemblages coalesce out of a series of complex relationships, exhibit properties that emerge only from such coalescence, and are continually open to contingent transformations. One difﬁculty lies in knowing where an assemblage begins and ends, and how many other assemblages it enfolds—I will offer a response to this later. The advantage of the concept is that we can see that its components (including forces and concepts as well as things, materials, organisms) each have histories before entering the assemblage and that their properties and effects change as the assemblage in which they are involved changes. Many of the elements of an assemblage are materials and artefacts, but assemblages also incl…

would have to be weighed against one another). But the necessity to break out of one type of material would be m ade evident as precisely the attitude which the m odern artist feels com pelled to adopt. The free disposition over various stocks of materials seem s at first sight to broaden creative possibilities immeasurably. This is indeed true in a certain sense, but at the same time it no less drastically restricts the chances of success. H ere lies the m om ent of truth in the norm ative restrictions which A dorno and Lukâcs adopt (though in opposite directions). Valéry saw this correctly: the restriction of the field of productive possibilities can increase the chances of artistic success, because it com pels concentration. But - and Valéry over­ looked this - the restriction must not be an arbitrarily postulated on e, but must be experienced by the producer as necessary. Because V aléry’s poetic activity submits to coercions that are set only

Thus social assemblages larger than individual persons have an objective existence because they can causally affect the people that are their component parts, limiting them and enabling them, and because they can causally affect other assemblages at their own scale. The fact that in order to exercise their causal capacities, internally as well as externally, these assemblages must use people as a medium of interaction does not compromise their ontological autonomy any more than the fact that people must use some of their bodily parts (their hands or their feet, for example) to interact with the material world compromises their own relative autonomy from their anatomical components. And a similar point applies at larger scales. When cities go to war, a recurring event in the age of city- states, they interact causally through their military organizations. Whether this interaction should b…

indiscernibles. Let us look at how this works. Rodriguez-Pereyra deﬁnes a concrete∗object as follows: ... let us call x concrete∗if and only if x is concrete, memberless and a maximal occupant of a connected region.20 He also explains the idea of a maximal occupant of a connected spatio- temporal region. A region A is connected if and only if every two points in A can be joined by a path of points in A and disconnected if and only if it is not connected. Let us say that x is a maximal occupant of a connected region if and only if x occupies a connected region and for all y, if x is a part of y then y is scattered, where a scattered object is one occupying a disconnected region.21 This means that a solitary brick, to use Rodriguez-Pereyra’s example, is a maximal occupant of a connected region as it occupies a connected region and it is not part of any larger unscattered object. As the brick is

With these three characteristics Mbembe follows Weizman’s demonstration that there is a vertical organisation of two separate geographies here: coloniser and colonised, and that the discipline that can vertically orga- nise inhabitable spaces (especially through its traditional graphical methods of sectional exposition – see Weizman chapter of this volume) and conjoin and separate circulation around, between and apart from these spaces is archi- tecture. We might also point out the irony here of Schopenhauer’s deﬁnition

is to identify the smooth spaces that can establish the becoming of 'new earths and new peoples' (Deleuze and Guattari 1994: 108). The venerable aspect of smooth spaces is that they don't channel desire into arborescent striations and they don't follow axioms like capital. Rather, they present a multitude of vectors as possible lines of flight. Smooth spaces, rhizomes, present moments of becoming; communities can become rhizomatic and smooth, or arborescent and striated. With this in mind, I would like to suggest that open-source computer programming presents an embodiment of the process of rhizomatic becoming, where multitudes can conspire to produce a program which is never total and never complete. If we remember the rhizomatic formula n-l, never forming a totality and always being open to exchange, the Deleuzian framework offers an amazing promise of opportunities for co…

their genesis and their agendas. Parikka undertakes a cartographical analysis of the environmental arts, in this context encompassing a range of projects that traverse traditional boundaries between geography, philosophy, institu­ tional mediation, artistic practice and science. His chapter is an exercise in mapping the practices and processes that make up an ‘operating system’, and he identifies a series of analytic strategies for understanding such systems. They involve cognisance of the principle of ‘survol’ or height, which enables a beyond-individual, trans-localised perspective for considering how a system of elements connect;15 the framing act or art of establishing a ‘fron­ tier’ by carving out a situated or localised ‘territory’ from a boundless plane of consistency or composition; the institutional frameworks or technologies

that access to the grammatical is afforded, and the possibility of isolating the manageable, or analyzable, "units" that constitute linguistics proper is also determined. Yet it is precisely here, in Saussure s pragmatic and entirely understandable desire to secure linguistics and the specificity of its particu- lar operations as an autonomous science, that we see him straining to resolve and, indeed, to avoid the provocative ramifications of his own intellectual inquiry. Saussure could not have been unaware of an uneasy tension in his assertions on this point. Elsewhere, for example, he insists that the task of definitively isolating any unit or identity is an impossible one: The linguistic mechanism is geared to differences and identities, the former being only the counterpart of the latter. Everywhere then, the problem of identities appears; moreover, it blends partially with the problem of entities and units and is only a complication—illuminating at some points—of the

points to the difficulty of fixing universally valid concepts in times of a broken relationship between subjects, objects, and language. The strength of authenticity thus lies in its possible application as both a normative and a non-normative, critical concept. Authenticity is nor- mative, for example, when the concept as a category of singularity makes the claims of subjective impressions explainable and describa- ble. In this case, the concept of authenticity retains its validity even when the traditional implications of the artist as someone constituted by craftsmanship and creativity no longer form any basis for art. In spite of the delegation of manufacturing work from the artist to profes- sionals and industry, the demand for the work and the author to be original is upheld. Minimalist artists who have worked with industrial materials rejected the replications of their w…

The speciﬁc digital materiality of the simulated models has both high-resolution photogrammetry and the forensic diagnostics. The resultant models have visually detailed surfaces that the digital choreographed camera movement then penetrates moving through to the various 3D tomographic represen- tations where cracks and conservation repairs can be seen, and the composition of materials and previously unseen materials are revealed in the interiors. Although the photogrammetry models may have broken fresh ground in how they have merged data sets from the diagnostics, the mode of presentation has not. These models will be presented on screens that are reminiscent of the museum’s usual framed presentation, whether via 2D or within cabinets (Fig. 5). It is a deﬁned “looking space”;…

of reality. On this account, matter, humans, bugs, bird nests, microscopes, fountain pens, and glass sculptures equally count in the production of phenomena. Barad’s philosophical insights provide at least two major clues to think­ ing about wonder in ontological terms. First, humans and nonhumans must be thought of on an equal ontological level. Humans, while distinct from animals, rocks, tumbleweeds, and bath robes, are not more ontologi­ cally significant. All objects are always-already entangled with their sur­ rounding objects, creating phenomena rather than individuals. The second clue, built on quantum physics, is that entangled objects (including humans), take part in the ongoing performance of the world as a continual articulation of difference. For Barad, this articulation of the world “is not a human-dependent characteristic but a feature of the world in its differ­ ential becoming. The world articulates itself differently” (Barad 2007,

names’ (PF 160). The representation is imperfect, but functional. Even when an agent has successfully wrangled a sufh- cient subset of the multitude into alignment, this success will have forced the agent to undergo a trial that continues to inform and deform its own composition. Empowered to act by a sufficiently queued multitude, the multitude’s swarming complexity will still animate its representative agent in surprising ways. Even in cases where the agent is conscious, its “action is not done under the full control of consciousness; action should rather be felt as a node, a knot, and a conglomeration of many surprising sets of agencies” (RS 44). In this sense, the line between the conscious and the non-conscious, between the purposeful and the pur- poseless, between the intentional and the non-intentional, is blurred. The human and the nonhuman bleed into each other as human intentions are animated by powerfully pur-

18 Ignacio Farías and Anders Blok highlighted in existing urban studies that pay attention to atmospheres in the phenomenological sense (e.g. Latham and McCormack 2009), places are not simply networked; instead, they involve certain distinguishable ways of assem- bling and articulating sets of entities, relations, experiences and sensations into shared spaces of co-­existence. On the other hand, and as Latour (2007a) has himself keenly noted, recent contributions by Peter Sloterdijk (2004, 2011) helped to pave the way for a more encompassing ‘ecological’ discussion of atmospheres, in terms of how socio-­material conditions of life-­support and survival are held together, or indeed disastrously disrupted, in cities. Sloterdijk’s atmospheres are directly concerned with the limits of the common world, with the material condi- tions required to sustain life in cities, as this invo…

entities to be discussed here. There are many others properties (such as the density of the connections in a network, or the degree of centralization of authority in an organization) that are not extensive but intensive, and that are equally important. Finally, social entities will be characterized in this book not only by their properties but also by their capacities, that is, by what they are capable of doing when they interact with other social entities. To those readers who may be disappointed by the lack of cross-cultural comparisons, or the absence of detailed analyses of social mechanisms, or the poverty of the historical vignettes, I can only say that none of these worthy tasks can be really carried out within an impoverished ontological framework. When social scientists pretend to be able to perform these tasks without ontological foundations, they are typically using an implici…

The question of the positionality of the epistemological practice of Forensic Architecture is thus a spatially complex one that is not easily viewed within the inside/outside spatial dualism. For Weizman and Forensic Architecture this idea that their case, their models, their exposé, is not constructed as oﬃcial insiders, that often it is not performed or submitted in a state court of justice; that it is conceived and constructed outwith and beyond the State prosecutors’ oﬃce – and indeed often without their ken – that it is compiled without the stamp of approval, co-operation or privileged access to the knowledge and evidence held by police, or the army or other oﬃcial investigators, is to them often, and ironically, an advantage. Their operation, like that of Sara Ahmed, rejects complicity with the oﬃcial story of ‘happiness’ in the interior and performs the role of public killjoy for the state establishment.

sets of rules. (As usual, I would be ontologically committed only to this singular and highly significant set, not to the sum total of the rules.) This has been done for cellular automata and has clarified the amazing ability of some inter­ actions to give rise to a variety of emergent effects that most other interactions do not give rise to. But it is a long way from this one particular example – analyzed in detail in my Philosophy and Simulation (2011) – and an intellectually satisfying conception of the possibility spaces associated with capacities to affect and be affected. So, to summarize. I have a principled (and time-tested) way to define the structure of possibility spaces associated with tendencies, but I do not have one for capacities. My strategy is to proceed by analogy: in the case of tendencies the structure is defined by special or remarkable possibilities at…

Finally, we examine how critical phenomenology sustains an account of solidarity and coalition among women that centres on a positive appraisal of vulnerability. We conclude by considering how vulnerability and precariousness can be part of a project of coalitional politics by drawing on Butler's reflections on the power of public assembly.

Introduction | 15 as into purveyors of social and cultural values. Such an approach runs parallel to and complements the study of the extensive side of infrastructures. While it evokes something of the intensive side of infrastructures, it sustains a focus on what is perceptible, primarily on a large scale and at a macro level. As such, this approach tends to subordinate the intensive side of infrastructure (what it produces—­affects and values) to the extensive side of infrastructure (what pro- duces it—­governments, corporations, and engineers and technicians). As I will show in this study, it thus tends to focus primarily on the one-­to-­many tendency of infrastructures—­on centralizing tendencies—­in a symbolic register. Second are accounts of infrastructures that strive to give more latitude to their intensive side by shifting attention away from the perceptible and focusi…

­Those citations are at the heart of this proj­ect. See Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus; and Latour, Reassembling the Social. Some notable exceptions are scholars such as Jasbir Puar who complexly navigate such scholarship and its import for histories of occupation, race, and sexuality. Puar’s concerns, however, do not extend to historiographical formulations of networks. See Puar, Terrorist Assemblages. For a genera- tive history of literary readings of networks, see C. Levine, Forms. Levine draws heavi­ly from current debates within global and/or comparative lit­er­a­ture, where the concept of “networks” has functioned as an allegory for a more capacious reading practice. 19 See P. Levine, Prostitution, Race, and Politics; and Pragna Shah, Street Corner Secrets. Durba Mi­tra’s Indian Sex Life is one of the few works that provides more epistemic histories of prostitution within South Asia. 20

‘You may or may not know that there are more professional musicians in Liverpool than in any other British city.’ This extended form also makes apparent the illocutionary force of all statements about the world in that they always implicitly require a response either of assent or disagreement from those participating in the speech act. This performative function can be understood as a form of bearing witness. Finally the ﬁrst person perspective can be brought out by changing the form to ‘I believe that there are more professional musicians in Liverpool than in any other British city.’ For Habermas these three components, that I have unpacked here, are contained within all performative propositional statements about events and states of affairs. Once this is recognised, notions of truth, validity and knowledge become complicated with normative judgements and values that exceed simple issu…

of properties. The account we are proposing is the following: – The more a construction’s properties are motivated, the better it functions as a gestalt. There is a great deal that follows from this principle. Good gestalts are cognitively simple, easy to learn, easy to remember, and easy to use. They also have the following very important property: – If A is a good gestalt, and B is a minimal variation of A, then B is almost as good a gestalt as A. In other words, there is a very good reason why cognitive structure is organized in terms of good gestalts and minimal variations on them: it maximizes cognitive efficiency. Thus, we can see why there should be so many radially structured categories. If a cognitive model is a good gestalt, then minimal variations on it will be easy to learn, remember, and use. When there are many minimal variations on a cognitive model, the result is a radial…

This dictionary draws on the insights of scholars who have each, in their own ways, made important contribu- tions both to understanding Agamben’s thought, and to developing it in new directions. The limits of this dictionary, we feel, therefore coincide with the limits of Agamben scholarship as it currently exists. It is our hope that putting this dictionary into the world will enable those who can see its limits to transcend them.

The possession of writing vastly increases man’s ability to pre- serve knowledge. It can be thought of as an artificial memory, the development of which ought to lead to a clearer awareness of the past, and hence to a greater ability to or­ga­nize both the present and the future. After eliminating all other criteria which have been put forward to distinguish between barba- rism and civilization, it is tempting to retain this one at least: there are peo- ples with, or without, writing; the former are able to store up their past achievements and to move with ever-­increasing rapidity towards the goal they have set themselves, whereas the latter, being incapable of remembering the past beyond the narrow margin of individ…

to change capacities, humans can be thought as uniquely able to alter and transform their substance, or rather than being in a set of fixed relations with others of their kind and with the features of their habitat, humans can be thought unique in being able to change and manipulate their relations. We will encounter this self-reflexivity particularly in relation to Malabou and Serres. These three categories of substance, capacity and relation will provide our preliminary orientation in the transformations of the human in contemporary French thought. Pointing out the dangers and shortcom- ings of various ‘hosts’ along with their reflexive variants will be a regular

must now analyse in turn three broad patterns of shock response. The ﬁrst pattern of shock-response to be considered pertains to the phenomenon of aura itself. For, whilst in modern and postmodern times it has undergone widespread and accelerating decay, this has not been a blanket phenomenon. Rather there are certain contexts where it has survived—in a concentrated form, even. The best example is the extraordinary boom undergone by the art market and gallery system since the late 1950s. Original works now command unparalleled prices, major galleries draw increasingly large attendances even for mediocre exhibitions. At the heart of this lies an astonishing practical reversal of Benjamin's logic. For it is precisely because we are so accustomed to reproductions of visual artworks that our encounter with an original takes on the shock-value of a privileged experience. Indeed, it may well b…

point of impossibility. As a result, the status of the literary work cannot be addressed within a thought that does not also place itself within this ambiguity and insta- bility. Blanchot’s insight was to realize that this impossibility is both the source and the failure of poetry; the conditions under which it endlessly strives and by which it fundamentally unsettles the poet’s existence. But in doing so he directly questioned the nature of Heidegger’s readings, for the implications of this impossibility affect the very language by which we seek to approach poetry. If this radical repetition is of the essence of lan- guage, then its ambiguity and instability cannot be limited to poetic lan- guage but are always already present in the language we use to approach poetry. Thus the language we use must change if we are to attempt to encounter poetry; we must become aware of how our thinking is already engaged in an encounter with poetry by virtue of its language, and that as

realization of the good life in the polis, ﬁnds itself in Agamben’s work at the junction of Schmitt’s sovereign exception and Foucault’s practices and regimes of biopower. This “sacred being,” or s/he who “can be killed but never sacriﬁced,” occupies a particular zone of indistinction between “exclu- sion and inclusion, outside and inside, bios and zoe, right and fact.”18 The political state of exception opens up the possibility of creating a spatial domain where the individual body becomes an object abandoned to the full arbitrary force of sovereign power (more will be said on this in Chapter 3). Or at least, and this is precisely where Foucault’s thought is both inserted and expanded upon by Agamben, in this zone of sovereign indistinction where bare life is at play, the full range of regulating, disciplining, but also eﬃciently functioning techniques of government from a wide array of…

to render explicit the conditions without which the range of problems to be resolved would be feeble, fallacious or already out of date. In practice, this means opening up hypotheses, breaking down interdictions, omissions or ignorance, to make flexible or to overturn objectives which present themselves, at first glance, as ‘evident’. The second seeks to supply concrete localizations for problems considered to be the most important, to map pertinent points of contact, to project concrete hypotheses onto the soil of social life, and, in this way, to construct a geography of the possible. (1973:270) De Certeau’s argument raises with some force the questions that have to be asked before we can envision articulating the questions of ‘who is she and who am I’. ‘Disclosing and critiquing closures’ and ‘creating and rendering precise openings’ are the twinned conditions of possibility …

within the broader context of globalisation. As she notes, ‘there is a need both to capture the distinctions, differentiations and nuances of complex inequalities . . . and to keep the global horizon in sight’ (Walby, 2009: 2–3). In complexity theory she finds the toolbox to analyse these multiple systems as it permits a rethinking of the concept of system. In particular, she argues that when reconceptualised from a complexity perspective, systems – while having boundaries – also intersect with other systems, allowing the possibility of thinking about their mutual influ- ence. These intersections are always far from straightforward (or linear), and forms of inequality interact in ways that can only be understood from a complexity based analysis. Walby’s model permits the analysis of unequal power relations between different systems. Central to this is the concept of fitness landscape, which provides a way of understanding power differentials. Additionally, it allows the

Domination is strengthened to the extent that subalterns accept this narrative as a rationalisation of their reasons for acting: The theatrical imperatives that normally prevail in situa- tions of domination produce a public transcript in close conformity with how the dominant group would wish to have things appear. The dominant never control the stage absolutely, but their wishes normally prevail.

way, his architectural vision. This is precisely because the object only finds consistency once it has crossed a certain threshold of autonomization and is able to recreate contextual relations in its own terms. This phenomenon is particularly significant in the sumptuous l(j,in Plaza building (1987), constructed on a site at the edge of a river in Osaka such that both are genuinely trans­ formed by this intrusion. Thus in his pulsional phase, from the initial drawing to the final implementation within the urban fab­ ric, a whole series of mutations in the matter of expression tends to detach the deterritorialized urban object from the psyche that initiated it. In my opinion, it is this detachment and objective self-sufficiency of the architectural machine that constitute the main achievement of Shin Takamatsu's work.

By calculating the difference between the original image and the ‘ghost image’, Appleton was able to measure the difference between the object and the receiver, an important breakthrough in terms of the development of radar systems ( Baird, Brown and Waddell 2005 ). In Scott’s experiments, as with Appleton’s and Marey’s, the experimental media, the phonograph, the camera, the television, reformulates the experimental subject as frequency modulations, in the case of Scott and Appleton, or as discrete moments in time, in the case of the analytical photographers that followed
