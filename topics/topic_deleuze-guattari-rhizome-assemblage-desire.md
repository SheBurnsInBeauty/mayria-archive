necessarily tied to the constituting powers of subjectivity. Contemporary attempts to investigate the roots of desire through cosmological and post- metaphysical reflections prove true the fecundity of this revaluation. The last part of the volume (“Desire, Cosmology and Metaphysics”) focuses on three philosophical endeavors that aim to rethink the foundations of phenomenology and French philosophy positively. In Signs, Merleau-Ponty explained: “in the last analysis, phenomenology is neither materialism nor a philosophy of mind. Its proper work is to unveil the pre-theoretical layer on which both of these idealizations find their relative justification and are gone

is something that so many of us happily participate in. We desire, we assemble and arrange it. In this respect, Deleuze’s work is well placed to examine the production of the different, that is, avoiding a repetition of the same. However, as both Deleuze and Guattari stress throughout their work, they see increasingly little capacity in media, including digital media, for the new and ‘outlandish’ (deterritorialised) to emerge (Deleuze and Parnet 2012), or for new singularities to form that could escape the capturing and recoding by capitalism (Guattari and Rolnik 2008). Important in that regard is Deleuze’s view that we are multiple, and not a unity (Smith 2012, 69). Desire is precisely not one, not individual. Desire, the flows of desire, ‘the state of our unconscious drives and inclinations’ (Smith 2012, 71), is precisely what is recoded, reterritorialised by capitalism, in…

Deleuze and Guattari define desire as a force of liaison, a force of linkage conveying a transformational tendency. Desire has no par- ticular object. It is a vector. Its object is before it, always to come. Desire vectorizes being toward the emergence of the new. Desire is one with the auto-­conducting movement of becoming. Becom- ing bears on linked experiential qualities in a solidarity of mutual modification, or what Deleuze and Guattari call “blocks” of sensa- tion.17 It plays upon unpredictable relational effects. It is the impro- visation of these deformational, relational effects that constitutes the new. As Deleuze writes, “Form is no longer separable from a transformation or transfiguration that . . . establishes ‘a kind of linkage animated by a life of its own.’ ”18 Creative life of instinct: vital art. Ruyer remarks that it is of the

the night sky, some shining brighter than others according to the nature of the times themselves. The aim of philosophy, then, is to construct new constella­ tions according to the changing demands of the present (Deleuze and Guattari 1994: 59). Putting it differently, one could say schizoanalysis arises at the point where the discourses of psychoanalysis, phenomenology and Marxism founder, namely on the rock of desire. No reader of Deleuze and Guattari can be unaware of the importance of desire in their work, yet it seems few have fully grasped the originality of their conception of it. The general assumption is that desire is used in an ordinary sense to mean simply instinctual longing, but this is not at all the case.1 Deleuze and Guattari categorically reject the idea that desire is an undifferen­ tiated instinctual energy (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 215). Despite this, the …

control the free expression of human desire. For Deleuze and Guattari, individuals are 'desiring machines', who lack the sense of unity we generally associate with individual identity, but who find the opportunity to express their desire being curbed by the socio-political authorities (with fascism the most potent example of how the process works). Psychoanalysisbecomes for Deleuze and Guattari a symbolof how desire is suppressed, and in opposition to it they posit 'schizo- analysis', based on the experience of the schizophrenic - who in their scheme of things becomes some kind of ideal model of human behaviour. The political dimension to poststructuralist thought, often somewhat hidden under cloudymetaphysicaldiscussionsindeconstruc- tion, is certainly foregrounded here. Difference feminism can also be included under the heading of post- structuralism, in that it questions the supposed …

late the conditions of representability of another social subject. (De Lauretis 1985: 163) This move was paralleled by the search for alternate theories of desire and of the body, where the issue of ambiguity in representation was sidelined or suppressed. In a bid to ﬁnd a feminist orientation in a non-psychoanalytic theory of desire, Elizabeth Grosz extolled the beneﬁts of the theories of Giles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, whose anti-Lacanian speculations conﬁgured desire as ‘not a lack but a positive force of production’ (Grosz 1994: xvi). For Deleuze and Guattari, she said, desire was ‘no longer identiﬁed with a purely psychical and signifying relation’ as it had been with Lacan, but was ‘a force or energy which creates links between objects, which makes things, forges alliances, produces connections’ (Grosz 1994: xvi). The metaphor which Deleuze and Guattari offered to express desire’s complexity was the ‘rhizome’, a stem of a plant that can produce both roots and shoots.

abstract desire and physical sexual pleasure. The understanding and location of plateaus of contemporaneity makes it possible to argue that one of the reasons why the philoso- phy of Deleuze and Guattari has become increasingly employed in critical and cultural research is because they offer concepts that correspond to, rather than counteract, many cultural phenomena of today. Numerous studies exploring contemporary culture in terms of rhizomatic structures, lines of flight, difference and desire suggest that Deleuze and Guattari’s work provides powerful tools to talk about culture and capitalism as they shape contemporary life. At the same time, this seeming applicability needs to be problematised, not only because the correspondence may not be as clear-­cut as it some- times seems, but also because in order to reserve some of the original political power of resistance we may need to read Deleuze against

produces connections’ (Grosz 1994: xvi). The metaphor which Deleuze and Guattari offered to express desire’s complexity was the ‘rhizome’, a stem of a plant that can produce both roots and shoots. There is a rupture in the rhizome each time the segmentary lines explode into a line of ﬂight, but the line of ﬂight is part of the rhizome. These lines never cease to refer to one another, which is why a dualism or dichotomy can never be assumed, even in the rudimentary form of good and bad. A rupture is made, a line of ﬂight is traced, yet there is always the risk of ﬁnding along it organizations which restratify everything, formations that restore power to a signiﬁer, attributions that reconstitute a subject. (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 18) Hence, this conceptualisation of desire is neither a return to the Enlightenment ideal nor a rupture that signiﬁes lack. Instead it positions the embodied subject within a set of material practices in which ambiguity does not ﬁgure in a

of psychoanalysis, it may be useful to think through the ambivalence with regards to work by Deleuze and Guattari, which Robert J.C. Young does in Colonial Desire (1995). Noting that Deleuze and Guattari’s work has been relatively absent from discussions regarding postcolonial the- ory, Young argues that their work produces a social theory of desire that ‘cuts through the problematic psychic-social opposition of orthodox psychoanalysis’ (1995, 168). For Young, Deleuze and Guattari’s repre- sentation of capitalism as a desiring machine in Anti-Oedipus not only reflects the development of industrialisation but also the violent process of colonialisation. Deleuze and Guattari’s figuration of the desiring machine and their concept of territorialisation allow Young to map out an ‘ethnography of colonial desire’ which is marked by a ‘dialectic of attraction and repulsion’ (1995, 174–175). Although Khanna and Young approach the notion of colonial desire through different theoretical reg-

the subject that is missing in desire, or desire that lacks a fixed subject’ (1983 [1972], 26).18 In this way, they shift the emphasis in the movement of desire towards an in-between territory; or, to use their terminology, a ‘deterritorialized’ space (1983 [1972], 35). Lack in Deleuze and Guattari’s refiguration becomes an effect of desire, rather than an origin (1983 [1972], 27). The shift they make in emphasising lack in the subject rather than in desire have important bearings on feminist revisions of desire, as will be discussed. In Deleuze and Guattari’s rethinking, desire moves along deterritori- alized lines. Their model of desire does not rely on lack to structure and motivate desire as does a psychoanalytical interpretation. As Rosi Braidotti argues: ‘In their appeal to a more positive theory of desire, Deleuze and Guattari argue that the idea of desire as lack reflects the specific his- toricity and the socio-economic conditions of a moment of capitalist

replace the Freudian id. “The Desiring-Machines”—the title of the first chapter of the first volume (Deleuze and Guattari [1977] 1983)—tracks opportunistic “couplings and connections” of “desiring-production” (ibid., 1): “an ongoing process of becoming that is the becoming of reality” (ibid., 35). For Deleuze and Guattari, desire was an emancipatory category; it had the capacity to trans- form reality. 1 I would like to thank Paulo de Assis, Edward Crooks, Peter Dejans, and all the scholars, artists, and interlocutors at the Orpheus Institute for their engagement during my time as a visiting researcher at the institute in 2015.

work well in Deleuze and Guattari’s construction of desire and the bodies it produces has already been established by numerous readers and readings of their philosophy, but physical pleasure, in its more concrete form as well as more direct expression through orgasm, is harder to capture in the continuous production of volatile bodies. As the first part of this chapter shows, Deleuze can, and has been, used to theorise contemporary configurations of the body in relation to collectivity, communication, reproduction and biotechnology, to mention a few of the topical fields in which the body and our understanding of it are currently expanded. Yet, as the second part of this chapter will argue, Deleuze’s rejection of the creative poten- tial of the orgasm relies on presuppositions about the body and its relation to a subject that go against the very grain of Deleuze’s own understanding of bodies and desires. These presuppositions need to

Conclusion 167 unique social and historical conditions’ (Herzog 2008, 64). What Deleuze and Guattari are suggesting we do is to schizoanalyse the systems that our desire has created – trace its flows, seek to uncover how its energy is invested in producing this particular society – consider what our desire produces and then take that desire and reinvest in something new, something creative and something that will help people desire a new and better world.

terms: “Desire, the only means of resistance or renewal in Acker’s work, follows the subterranean paths of Deleuze and Guattari’s rhi- zomes, undercutting any light-of-day, rationalized paths in creating a network with no priorities other than its own, circumventing any politi- cization of desire that would simply redirect it into new dichotomies” (49). Deleuze and Guattari make clear how such “subterranean” flights depart from the notion of a self-enclosed site elsewhere in discussing the Body without Organs: “Machines attach themselves to the body without organs as so many points of disjunction, between which an entire network of new syntheses is now woven” (Anti-Oedipus 12). Deleuze and Guattari’s spaces always open outward, creating “new syn- theses” that exceed any defined space. Like Deleuze and Guattari, Acker fights against any self-contained understanding of textual sites. Acker…

receive, and transmit” ( AO 293), until the point “where homosexuality and heterosexuality cannot be distinguished any longer” and a “fi nally conquered nonhuman sex mingles with the fl owers, a new earth where desire functions according to its molecular elements and fl ows” ( AO 319). Both the ideas and the defi antly odd phrasing of these accounts attest to the diffi culty Deleuze and Guattari ascribe to discerning or even conceiving desire, despite its ubiquity. 50 Beyond the comparable stylistic diffi culty or divisive politics of the writers Deleuze and Guattari credit as sages regarding desire (Proust, Melville, Kafk a, Burroughs, Lawrence, and Miller, among others), the bigger hurdle desire poses to the readers and writers of Anti-Oedipus entails the “necessity for desiring-production to be induced from representation” ( AO 314–315), a prac- tice Deleuze and Guattari repudiate in every sense. 51 Th is dilemma requires

that we would generally rather not dwell on and argues that looking at these things in an unﬂinching fashion may in fact allow the discernment of more positive and in any case less pathologizing modes of perception. In a strange way this project would align itself with certain strands of utopian Marxism, which are in no small way its inspiration. However, its focus is perhaps arrested at an early stage in such a panoramic undertaking. That is, rather than looking to a beyond, it tries to examine why certain situa- tions of extreme exploitation, illness, and alienation may not be as uni- formly negative as they may appear from the outside. And that is because these states approach pure being, if one might call it that, in a less medi- ated way than is normally the case. This is the perception that Deleuze’s work helps facilitate. Though he and Guattari took this elsewhere in the Capitalis…

social movements. Inspired by the French uprisings of 1968, Deleuze and Guattari approached spontaneous mass rebellion as an explosion of desire.30 For them, desire is really desiring—a general, impersonal process that is onto- logical rather than psychological. Individual desires (for fame, fortune, sex, or romance) obviously exist; however, for Deleuze and Guattari, such individual wants and needs are secondary. Although we have desires, we are, first and foremost, of desire. In other words, human beings are an effect of the desiring process.31 This desiring process is a constant, prepersonal assembling-disassembling-and-reassembling of connections and associations. Anything can link up and connect with anything else in the prepersonal realm of desire: this-and-that, blank-and-blank.32 At the same time, however, this fluid process is copresent with stoppages, blockages, and m…

sion of thought. Deleuze and Guattari situate Stimmung, the in- tensities of affect, with the third synthesis; that of conjunctive synthesis of consumption. A few provisional conclusions can be drawn from this placement (without necessarily engaging Deleuze and Guattari’s entire reading of syntheses). First and foremost: affects are consumed and this consumption comes af- ter the synthesis of the production and the recording of desire. Deleuze and Guattari locate the subject on this synthesis. The subject comes after the production of desire and the recording of desire, caught in the tension between the forces that consti- tute the world and their inscription. As Deleuze and Guattari write, Thus this subject consumes and consummates each of the states through which it passes, and is born of each of them anew, continuously emerging from them as a part made up of parts, each on…

14 Deleuze and the Schizoanalysis of Visual Art in a transitive fashion: any attempt to define desire as the desire for something immediately puts us back into the realm of lack. Productive desire cannot be the desire for something, it must produce something. This brings us to the most important twist in Deleuze and Guattari’s rethinking of desire: if desire is productive and what it produces is real, then desire must be actual and not virtual. Deleuze and Guattari are quite explicit on this point. Referring to the formation of symptoms, such as hallucinations, Deleuze and Guattari write: ‘The actual factor is desiring-production’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 129). To which they add the following important clarifi­ cation: ‘The term “actual” is not used because it designates what is most recent [which is its usual meaning in both French and German], and because it would be oppos…

critical appropriations can be understood to have themselves interpreted and hence transformed psychoanalytic thinking. In the case of Deleuze and Guattari’s work, the thesis is apparent from the very title of the ﬁrst book they published on the topic. The core of their interpretation is the centrality of the Oedipal triangle to the interpretive practices of canonical psychoanalytic texts, whose effect is, in their view, invariably to reterritori- alize the deterritorializations of the unconscious by making desire depend- ent on an original fantasy, whose basic form involves the threat of castration imposed by a father over a child whose natural object of desire is the mother’s body. By appropriating the concept of the unconscious as the ul- timate substrate of deterritorialization, Deleuze and Guattari argue con- vincingly that the concept of desire as conditioned by the lack imposed by castration not only deprives the concept of the unconscious of its philo-

of some masses, but politics is no less intoxicating, and science is the favorite addiction of many others. The poststructuralist approach builds on the psychoanalytic notion of an open-ended or nonunitary subject activated by desire. Deleuze and Guat- tari especially take the instance of the unconscious not as the black box, or obscure god, of some guilt-ridden subject of Lack, but rather as a receptor and activator of gratuitous forms of unprogrammed orientations and inter- connections. This situates sensuality, aff ectivity, empathy, and desire as core values in the discussion about the politics of contemporary nonunitary sub- jects. Equally central to this generation of philosophers is the focus on power as both restrictive (potestas) and productive (potentia) force. It also means that power formations are both monuments and documents, in that they are expressed in social i…

is whether or not his characterizations effectively make possible an "au- topoiesis" of the means of production of subjectivity. That is, Guattari creates cartographies of the social processes involved in the making of selves in order to foster subjectivities that break free from hegemonic forms and enable individuals and collectives to own creatively their own identities along with the processes that support them. It is to this kind of project that I hope to contribute. In the pages to come I explore the work of Luce Irigaray and of Gilles Deleuze, often in tandem with his collabo- rative work with Guattari, in order to suggest a model of subjectivity that could help to provide practical answers to the problem of how we could and should live in the world and with others. In keeping with the poststructuralist tradition in French philosophy from which this work is largely drawn, I assume that human selves are nei-

and desiring machines, a way of identifying a potential line of flight in the midst of sexual subjectification. After the publication of ‘Three Billion Perverts: An Encyclopedia of Homosexualities’ – an issue of the journal Recherches that he edited on the topic of homosexuality – he was accused of ‘affronting public decency’ and, as Gary Genosko notes, was repeatedly harassed by the police (Genosko 1996: 7). The trial that followed, Guattari insisted, was political. Desire, if allowed to open up to the world rather than be repressed by it, is no longer destructive (as, for example, the desire fuelling fascism) but creative. Importantly, the possibility of expression of ‘social desire’ needs to be opened up beyond resource to representatives. New and direct expressions of desire are crucial if we are to escape the dominant order and ‘build another world’ (Guattari 1996a: 192). What is central here is that Guattari, by linking this potential revolu-

mention current theories such as accelerationism. Art, Deleuze and Guattari insist, is not a matter of information or its communication, it is instead a “vacuole of non-communication,” the production of a “non-sense” capable of constructing an outside to our everyday affections and perceptions, to our boring opinions and banal thoughts. Expression is the construction of this outside, of a new future, giving art the utopian function of democratizing the processes of production, making aesthetic creation not only an ontological process but also the basis of any liberatory poUtics. This is a strangely modernist position, and raises significant challenges for those of us who wish to use it to understand contemporary art. On the one hand, its figures of rhizomes and nomads, and evocations of constant and creative movement seem to appeal to our contemporary experience. But on the other, Deleuze and Guattari’s equation of art and nature, and their demand for an

Guattari write about pleasure as being an affection of a subject and therefore a way for persons to ‘ “fi nd themselves” in the process of desire that exceeds them’ (Deleuze and Guattari 2004: 173). This means that pleasure is a mode of reterritorialisation that Deleuze and Guattari strive to circumvent. As long as the pursuit of pleasure is related to the ‘deplorable’ fact of orgasm, and pleasure is thus a norm, desire remains in a relation with lack. Pleasure thus has an intimate connec- tion with lack and subjectifi cation. If, instead, we untie pleasure from desire, the latter can be allowed to exist as a constructive positivity in its own right. This is why Deleuze and Guattari favour the idea of the masochist: because of its integral postponement of pleasure, masochism remains in the realm of desire. In his early essay ‘Coldness and Cruelty’, Deleuze shows how the work of Masoch himself raises very interesting

diagram of the strata and then see where you can go. Make your BwO - that is, find out where your degree o is and where your desires connect, your flows conjoin, your intensities continue. Deleuze and Guattari's refusal to remain with a psychoanalytic account of desire prompts them to explore an exciting range of possibilities in de- stratification. Psychoanalysis can lead one to believe that the only route to destructuring overly constrictive forms of subjectivity in order to stimulate richer integrations of libidinal drive is through pursuing the secret of oedi- palized desire. Although Irigaray works out of a psychoanalytic paradigm, I have tried to make clear how her account of embodied encounter between two subjects is not constrained by regression to the mother-child dyad. In- stead it entails open receptivity in the present and an active practice of per- ception that destab…

we also need to bring this out in his work. Maybe there is a sense in which Deleuze’s understanding of sexu- ality itself suffers from a disarming separation of forces. On the one hand, immense and very important work has been done on Deleuze and Guattari in relation to desire and to plateaus, and to the body without organs. The possibility of building a desiring ontology that is completely different from the understanding of the sexes and sexual- ity as they have been claimed by Oedipal theories as well as societal and gendered politics has proven crucial to post-­Deleuzian scholars interested in finding alternative and more productive ways of think- ing about the nature of the body and its relations. On the other hand, this valorisation of desire has resulted in a problematic separation between desire and sexuality. In interpretations of Deleuze, sexual- ity has tended to be po…

or correct an imperfection. Rather, desire is the means by which we continually make new connections in an attempt to produce some- thing new, something more powerful than we were before – in short, something that works. This conception of desire that does not seek to overcome a lack, but is itself productive, continually producing new forms, is what Deleuze and Guattari in Anti-Oedipus call ‘desiring-production’. Deleuze’s and Guattari’s argument in both Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus is that our current psychic and social organisation wildly restricts most forms of desiring-production. Desire is nor- malised within the conﬁnes of Oedipal sexuality, on the one hand, and capitalist consumption on the other. Using Deleuze’s and Guattari’s analyses I would like to examine anew the question of death, particularly as it is articulated by Heidegger and Hegel. For all of their difference…

into the world, desire. Gilles Deleuze’s aesthetic philosophy is particularly important to my articulation between works by these women, aesthetics, and psychoanalysis. The more common tendency among Deleuze scholars is to discard psychoanalysis as reactive, to which Deleuze’s own criticism of that field contributed, although psychoanalytic thought is a crucial under- pinning for his own theories. Deleuze’s continual proposal—expanded with Félix Guattari—of an experimental, decidedly non-normative unconscious, certainly makes room for theorizing women’s art and writing,3 and, I believe, it also favors a discussion on female subjectivity in its specificity, and on the feminine. This proposal’s break with Oedipal law enables an approach of the desire and jouissance problematic beyond a question of satisfactions that must be renounced and of the family romance as the decisive unde…

Deleuze and Guattari, Anti- Oedipus Conjunction Versus the Relational Deleuze and Guattari and Contemporary art. Our emphasis lies squarely on the conjunction, on what it might mean and what it might be able to do. How can we articulate or even explode this conjunction, now and for a future to come? What is at stake is an actualisation of Deleuze and Guattari’s ‘logic of the AND’; an actualisation in action, a pragmat- ics that is not a ‘localisable relation going from one thing to the other and back again’, but a ‘transversal movement that sweeps one and the other away, a stream without beginning or end that undermines its banks and picks up speed in the middle’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1988: 28). Following this ‘stream’ that erodes its own banks, we cannot

I argue, largely following Macherey, that by integrating desire into the infrastructure, they intend to flatten or collapse the in- frastructure/superstructure in order to re-materialize ideology critique (as noology critique). The second point is that Deleuze and Guattari want to save desire from ideology, and show that in fact there is an economy of desire, or that desire is part of the economy. They explicitly refer to Pierre Klossowski’s The Liv- ing Currency (1970) on this point, to make evident the associa- tion of desire with ideology (“two kinds of fantasy”), for desire, drives and affects “creat[e] within the economic forms their own repression, as well as the means for breaking this repression.”18 17 Deleuze and Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, 104.

energy, they still, unsurprisingly, prefer this cosmic distribution of sexuality to the Freudian reduction of sexuality to the petty familial (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 292). But while Reich’s ideas about social desire and the politicisation of psychoanalysis are crucial to Deleuze and Guattari, they repeatedly see how Reich gets caught up in the Oedipal and the individual in a way that prevents these ideas from becoming truly radical. Most centrally, Deleuze and Guattari argue that Reich is the first to address the relationship between desire and the social field (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 118) but that he fails to locate the link between the two. What he would have needed, they suggest, is an idea of desiring production that links them together (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 30). Instead, he remains caught up in his own paranoiac and miracu- lous desiring-­machines (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 119). Instead of

or sublimations’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 291). Rather, all phases of desiring-production – production per se, recording, and consumption/ consummation – take place within a single domain of sexual energy. The pertinent opposition within this domain is not between the individual and the social, but between the molar and the molecular, the molar being the territorialising aggregates of control that restrict desiring- production, the molecular the deterritorialising assemblages of desiring- production’s proliferating, destabilising connections and lines of fl ight. The third psychoanalytic assumption challenged by Deleuze and Guattari is that human sexuality is just that – exclusively human, or at least unrelated in any signifi cant way to human interactions with the non-human world. For Deleuze and Guattari, however, desiring-pro- duction is fundamental to Homo natura as well as…

theoretical currents which enable us to think of desire as production and multiplication. For Deleuze (1980), desire possesses a productive condition per se. He postulates that desire is not deﬁned by any essential lack, that the empty spaces and deserts are “fully” part of the ﬁeld of desire and do not create any kind of lack in it. He considers that “lack refers to a positive condition of desire rather than desire to a negative condition of lack”. When we categorize desire as production, we make it possible to detach the strict equations of subject of desire for the masculine and object of desire for the feminine. It allows us to think about female sexuality neither as mirrored by masculine sexuality nor in terms of a masculine subject of knowledge whose theories are derived only from its own experiences. This creates conditions for de-centring the complementary and also the supplement…

freed from the constraints imposed by the ideology of lack. Correspondingly, Dorothea Olkowski situates Deleuze’s writ­ ings in relation to theories of the body and desire in recent femi­ nist philosophy. She argues that Deleuze and Guattari’s account of the body and desire does not establish a precultural eros, as some feminists claim. Focusing in particular on Nietzsche and Philo­ sophy and Anti-Oedipus (by Deleuze and Guattari), Olkowski argues for a conception of positive desire that is not connected in any way to the Platonic schema of “man” as lacking being and therefore limiting human productive activity. She questions Oedipal constructions of the body and desire as hierarchical and exploitative. She further demonstrates how, for Deleuze and Guattari, the body (understood broadly as chemical, physical, biological, and social) is the force that undermines such construc­ ti…

nevertheless attracts and appeals. Each affirms an overabundance of resources beyond the need for mere survival, which is to say, to the capacity of both matter and life to exchange with each other, to enter into becomings that transform each. They attest to the artistic impact of sexual attraction, the becoming-other that seduc- tion entails. This is not a homeostatic relation of stabilization, the build-up and expenditure of libidinal energies that Freud sees as the foundation of orgasmic sexuality, but a fundamentally dynamic, awkward, mal-adaptation that enables the production of the frivo- lous, the unnecessary, the pleasing, the sensory for their own sake. Art proper, in other words, emerges when sensation can detach itself and gain an autonomy from its creator and its perceiver, when something of the chaos from which it is drawn can breathe and have a life of its own. Deleuze elaborates the concept of sensation as

In developing their understanding of desire, Deleuze and Guattari allow both sexuality and the animal to become-­other beyond psy- choanalytic and humanist interpretations. While recognising the creative potential of this move, the ambition of the present book is also to try to recuperate some of the elements of sexuality lost in this process. When it comes to the animal, many have celebrated the productive effects of Deleuze and Guattari’s take, while some have interpreted it as highly problematic. Donna Haraway, for example, rejects Deleuze and Guattari’s take on animals quite vehe- mently. Haraway’s repudiation of Deleuze and Guattari’s writing on becoming-­animal bears similarities with Jardine’s early response to their concept of becoming-­woman. Just as Jardine critiqued what seemed to be a circumvention of real women with this concept, Haraway repudiates what she percei…

Probyn concluded that ‘the productive force of desire can then be seen as it incessantly spins lines between the thing and the representation. Desire then is the force that connects and disconnects images and things’ (ibid.). Understood thus as a productive force and as an essence, desire is dissociated from the ambiguities of representation, and displaced from the usual, psychoanalytic ‘site and citing’ of desire ‘within a project of origins’ (1995: 15). This enables a point of departure from which to constitute ‘queer belongings’ in a network of material relations. Although speculation such as Probyn’s provided new and useful directions for queer theory and feminist art criticism that are unencumbered by the ambi- guities of the psyche, feminists have had reason to be deterred by the elaborate complexity of Deleuze and Guattari’s writing. As Grosz explained, the fact that

qu’autrui), and the anthropogenic force – the vis existendi or, as Deleuze now calls it, desire – will assert itself as the creative energeia of life. Rather than being a source of phantasms, desire, in Deleuze’s work, produces relations and connections that are real in their functions and revolutionary in their rhizomatic multiplicity because the Deleuzian desire is not deﬁned by the intentionality of ‘wanting to be or to have’;16 lacking nothing, it is deﬁned by the expression of its capacity to make connections. It is not assessed according to the extrinsic telos of pleasure, since it is desire itself that distributes the intensities of pleasure and attempts to stave off the dissipation of intensities in extension. Desire atrophies inside the dialectic of subject and object: either a fully consti- tuted subject will confront a fully constituted object, in which case desire can only be a relation external to both; or, if desire were to be thought

tours. The rhythm of animals and the connectivity of desire do not respect the boundaries chartered on humanist maps. At the same time, and like the concepts that for Deleuze and Guattari have the power to reconfigure the contours of what they define, the revolu- tionary force of rhythm can be employed to negotiate and expand the territories of human sexuality. Grosz, to whom we have often had reason to return in earlier chapters, has developed the ways in which rhythm and territories function to frame chaos and create intensive nonhuman states. The notion of becoming wolf, which in Deleuze and Guattari’s reading is a way of allowing for multiplicities rather than confining unities, can be engaged to expand the milieus of human and nonhuman territories. As the reading of Bear indicates, the human-­animal relation, no matter how intimate, is impotent so long as it is remains w…

using (as does Garnett) Deleuze’s Logic of Sense to suggest an art of surfaces and of non- discursive surface humour. Technologies It is well known that Guattari and Deleuze were fascinated by machines. Their work constantly invokes a technological ‘plane of immanence’ composing the organic and inorganic, material and immaterial, and actual and virtual realms of our ‘operating system’. In their processual complexity these machines have a particular relation to aesthetic proce- dures inasmuch as they construct, and are constructed by, sensations. ‘The machine is the affective state’, Deleuze and Guattari argue, ‘and it is false to say that modern machines possess a perceptive capacity or a memory; machines themselves possess only affective states’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1995: 128). Artistic machines explode in the middle of our contemporary ‘Mechanosphere’, they are creative lines of fl ight emerging from capitalism’s schizo- unconscious. In this way Deleuze

This book gathers contributions from international scholars with the aim of exploring both the interplay and contrast of Deleuze and Guattari’s and Foucault’s political critique of psychoanalysis through desire: their possible connections, the divergences and the fields of reflection that this encounter opens, and the problems and debates that led Foucault and Deleuze to engage w…

a romantic concept within his discussion of the regulation and production of desire and energy within a social field, Deleuze's writings of affect nevertheless enable a material, and therefore political, critique of capital and its operations. Within a Deleuzian framework, affect operates as a dynamic of desire within an assemblage to manipulate meaning and rela­ tions, inform and fabricate desire, and generate intensity - yielding different affects in any given situation or event. Perception is a non-passive continual moulding, driven and given by affect. Closely linked to Deleuze and Guattari's concepts of 'multiplicity', 'expe­ rience' and 'rhizomatics', the concept of 'affect' should also be considered in relation to the concepts of 'arborescence' and 'lines of flight'. Situated as part of the Deleuzian 'and' of becoming, the molecular thresholds of bodies and things as events are described by Deleuze in terms of affective happenings;

despite being implicated in the machinations of capital, art and science offer two possible means for critical engagement with the coded structures of desire (otherwise known as society). They begin with art. Over a few paragraphs, and ignoring art historical practices that tend to keep artists temporally and materially discrete, Deleuze and Guattari’s discussion slips from Lorenzo Lotto to J. M. W. Turner to John Cage. This obscure grouping describes what they call an ‘other’ art: a set of artworks that are formed from relations and experi­ mentation, strange flows, materials and energies. Deleuze and Guattari identify within these particular artworks a ‘force [that] fractured the codes, undid the signifiers, passed under the structures, set the flows in motion, and effected breaks at the limits of desire’ (1983: 369). Like other desiring-machines the breakthrough is effected …

My guides in the following explorations will be the writings of Deleuze and Deleuze and Guattari together and their critiques of signification and subjectification, the two dominant paradigms that have directed both feminist and postmodern politics; and the writings of Irigaray, with her insistence on the sexual specificity and irreducible bodily difference as the very motor of cultural and philosophical production. Through Deleuze, Guattari, and Iriga- ray, and their opening up of both nature and culture to unrec- ognized and open-ended forces, my goals will be to develop new ways of addressing and thinking about the arts and the forces they enact and transform and thus, indirectly, new ways of conceptual- izing politics and the ways in which art and politics can be linked

include orgasm in his theory of desire. There is a third way, however, in which we can employ Deleuze’s philosophy to expand sexual pleasure by disabling its dominant stratifications, that is inclusive of the orgasm. With the help of a radical politics of disability we can develop sexuality to include what Deleuze would describe as a trem- bling or stuttering, a discontinuation of the false unity and continuity of bodies. Combining a theory of disability with what Deleuze and Guattari theorise as a minor literature we can construct a fruitful way of disabling sexuality as a major concept. A minor literature affects language ‘with a high coefficient of deterritorialization’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1986: 16). This is a writing that does not have to emerge from a minor language, but it does appropriate a major language and puts it to use through deterritorialisations. As Réda Bensmaïa puts it in his foreword to Deleuze and Guattari’s book on Kafka,

largely through the adoption or refusal of particular sexual roles in relation to one’s parents (roles that supposedly get worked out in the course of the Oedipal process), sexuality is the primary channel through which we arrive at our identities as sexed beings. In other words, gender is achieved through sexuality. Furthermore, the fact that our demands are always in some sense a demand for the desire of another means that our sense of who we are is continually formed through libidinal relations. A dramatic contrast to psychoanalytic theories of desire is found in the work of Gilles Deleuze and F´elix Guattari. Deleuze and Guattari take great pleasure in criticizing and mocking psychoanalysis. They insist that psychoanalysishasfundamentallymisconstruedthenatureofdesirebecause it sees desire as always linked to sexuality. This is to misrepresent it: ‘Sleeping is a desire’, Deleuze obser…

20 | LACAN AND DELEUZE It is here that Deleuze and Guattari intervene and cut Lacan’s theory into two: Lacan’s admirable theory of desire appears to us to have two poles: one related to ‘the object small a’ as a desiring-machine, which defines desire in terms of a real production, thus going beyond both any idea of need and any idea of fantasy, and the other related to the ‘great Other’ as a signifier which reintroduces a certain notion of lack.40 This warding off of big Other from the strictly Lacanian perspective does not make sense. It has many consequences we cannot go into here, but the bottom line is that it perhaps represents an attack on Lacan’s conceptions of language and desire (‘desire is the desire of the Other’). It seems that later Deleuze still insists on one of its aspects: People’s dreams are always all-consuming and threaten to devour us. What other people dream is very dangerous. Dreams are terrifying will to power.

Introduction 3 In fact, as Eric Alliez argues here, the philosophy of Guattari has already been instrumentalised by the contemporary art market in the form of ‘relational aesthetics’. This art ‘movement’, named as such by the curator and art critic Nicolas Bourriaud, is now ubiquitous. It presents a precise instance of the problem: claiming a contemporary political effi cacy – in the name of Guattari – for ‘an art form where the substrate is formed by inter- subjectivity, and which takes being- together as a central theme’ (Bourriaud 2002: 15). But, Alliez asks, does this ‘inter- subjective substrate’ really represent a break with contemporary forms of subjection, or does it simply produce ‘a populism of the multi- tude, or more exactly a populism of which the multitude would be the (post)aesthetic subject and the object of “re- aestheticisation”? Where the aestheticisation of dissensus would become the post- political form

forces us to read their desire. Now it might seem, today, that it is Laplanche’s emphasis on the look of the other and each specifi c body’s relation to the law that might be a more fruitful understanding of our body’s relation to language and that this would accord, too, with Deleuze and Guattari’s criticism of the tyranny of Oedipus and the ‘despotism’ of the signifi er. But this is not so: for Deleuze and Guattari write a genealogy and diagnosis of the Oedipus complex and the privileging of the phallus. The virtue of the Lacanian critique is its ideality and inhumanity; before there is a human–human look or relation, something like the human organism has to be formed as an image. The body and its organs are historical and political phenom- ena. The modern man of capital does indeed live the relation among his body parts as oedipalised; he is the man of speech who must articu…

occupancy of nonorgasmic pleasures. Often associated with his contemporary Foucault, on the basis of their Nietzschean commitment to genealogical inquiry and their aver- sion to the psychoanalytic paradigms that dominated leftist thinking about social transformation, Deleuze (with Félix Guattari) also works to enunciate an alternate economy, a different rhizomatic conceptualiza- tion of desire that, by being open to the transversal energies and mutat- ing potentialities of things, deterritorializes the arborescent structures of Western thought. Deleuze and Foucault famously differ on their defi- nitions of desire and pleasure. In a series of notes drafted in 1977, which were intended for but never delivered to Foucault, Deleuze writes: The last time we saw each other, Michel told me, with much kindness and affection, something like, I cannot bear the word desire; even if you use…

Introduction: Th e Desiring-Image 19 Beyond more topical, personifying connotations, then, desire names a dy- namic intrinsic to such Deleuzian cinematic schemas as fi rstness-secondness- thirdness or perception-aff ection-action . In these cases, as in Deleuzo-Guattarian desiring-production, some force or system of relation asserts itself; it encoun- ters another force or relation that complements but disrupts the fi rst; and this collision produces something, whether an action, an image, a relation, or a pro- visional subject. Deleuze even alleges that “each one of us . . . is nothing but an assemblage of three images, a consolidate [ sic ] of perception-images, aff ection- images, and action-images” ( C1 66). 47 In other words, all perception, like all being, relating, and becoming, is fundamentally about desiring-production. 4. Desire, like movement and time, has no ideal forms . Th is notion, a broad

level at such a point and, through the strategic mimicry of double be- coming, combine as many potentials as pos­si­ble. Deleuze and Guattari, of course, are not suggesting that ­people can or should “objectively” be- come insects. It is a question of extracting and combining potentials, which they define as abstract relations of movement and rest, abilities to affect and be affected: abstract yet real. The idea is to build our own transporting machine and use it to get a relay ­going and to keep it ­going, creating ever greater and more power­ful amalgamations and spreading them like a contagion ­until they infect ­every identity across the land and the point is reached where a now all-­invasive positive simulation can turn back against the grid of resemblance and replication and overturn it for a new earth.

Consider what a BwO might be by thinking first of what a body with organs is: that is, it is a machine made up of machines. It is at all points a composite of the various desiring machines that go into it. At any point it is a compilation of ‘eating machines, speaking machines, shitting and fucking machines’ (Deleuze and Guattari 2004a, 1); each of these machines feeds upon flows of desire – the desire for, or perhaps rather, the desire that is connection, the desire that is production, the desire that is reproduction. Deleuze and Guattari are at pains to point out that the world we encounter is in many ways produced by the way these machines process desire. However, the notion of the body ‘without organs’ complicates the effect of these machines by raising the question of …

either upon forms of psychoanalysis or upon forms of “identity politics,” the subject is often typically characterised and described by her or his desire. For Deleuze, desire is not a matter of exerting a will upon exterior- ity, much less a matter of “choice,” either consumerist or existentialist: desire does not “bring something about.” Rather, desire is that which is produced through the encounter that, in the ﬁ rst place, is constitutive of both subject and object, and constitutive of them as subject and object. What Deleuze is trying to do is to ﬁ nd a way of addressing movement as the fundamental form of ontology, but ontology considered as the conditions of our becoming rather than as being. The result is the production of accidental conditions of consciousness or of desire. We are not here talking of desire as a set of “wants” or “choices” based on lack or need or wish.…

combats the ‘sad militants’ aiming to preserve the order of political discourse and protect the Truth, the ‘poor technicians of desire’ who reduce desire to lack, and the historical as well as the fascism within us, and thereby abandons issues of morality in favour of a de-­centralising, proliferating desire that cannot be captured either by unitary discourses or by fascist power hunger. Mutual grounds are established, then, through the denunciation of psychoanalysis and fascist appropriations of desire. By the time Foucault embarks on his own project on sexuality, however, it becomes clear that while they both reject psychoanalysis as a means to understand sexuality and desire, Deleuze and Guattari end up with wildly different alternatives to the Freudian model. While Foucault ends up writing a history of sexuality, Deleuze and Guattari remould earlier conceptualisations of …

itself its most elaborate and solicitous expression. Creation is higher than the reception of art, but the latter is higher, more involuted, than love, which itself becomes further unfolded in art. Proust’s hermetically sealed novel In Search of Lost Time is itself one of the dominant monads of Western culture. Complete interiorisation has been attained in the work of art, since it is the product of a pure manipulation of the ‘free materials of nature’ in the service of an Idea. It is possible that Deleuze and Guattari’s attack on the notion that it is possible to ‘extrapolate’ a transcendent object from the process of desire originates in Deleuze’s Proustian analysis of the experience of love. Deleuze and Guattari’s tendency to give primacy to desire therefore cannot be said to arise out of a radicalisation of the classical Freudian distinction between the ‘object’ and ‘aim’ of desire (SE 14, 122). For Freud, the fact that different types

others, a becoming towards difference, and a becoming through new questions. It is in this spirit of positive becoming that the essays in this volume encounter the work of Deleuze and Deleuze and Guattari. As Verena Andermatt Conley's location of Deleuze and Guattari's work within its own post-1968 Parisian terrain makes clear, the link between woman and becoming formed part of a general movement. The fact that there are resonances between the notions of becom- ing-woman and Helene Cixous's writing-woman is more than an interesting point of convergence in the history of ideas. It demon- strates that the contemporary encounter between Deleuze and feminism - explored in this volume - is more than the addition of two separate lines of thought. As Conley's essay demonstrates, questions of writing, woman, becoming, identity and style formed a philosophical and creative plane at the time Deleuze was writing.

create concepts. Deleuze does not give up desire but works to replace the psychoanalytic tradition with another one that makes it possible to claim the term as creative and productive. At the same time, one might argue that Deleuze abandons pleasure for the same reason. A similar but opposite strategy to their respective employment of pleasure and desire may be found in the different ways in which Deleuze and Foucault deal with the notion of the subject. While Foucault continues to discuss the subject, not least in his tracing of the ‘desiring subject’, Deleuze largely tries to abandon the notion in favour of more creative ideas of folding and becoming. If it is indeed a reference to Deleuze and Guattari, as Noys argues, Foucault would say that this attempted abandonment of the subject fails. He main- tains, in his introduction to The Use of Pleasure, that the notion of a desiring subject lingers also in conceptions of desire ‘that sought to

Introduction: What is Sex? 11 every kind of production (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 216). Desire ‘plugs into’ social machines which are machines that are also about desiring-production but under determinate conditions (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 29). They could be the family machine, the identity machine, the gender machine, or, indeed, the phallus machine, that is, a castrating machine that delimits the fl ows of sexuality by introducing itself as an object or cause of desire and therefore as lack (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 357). Apart from the phallic machine, another central example for Deleuze and Guattari is the capitalist machine – the organi- sation of wants and needs as central functions of a market economy (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 28). For Deleuze and Guattari then, the most important questions about sexuality always concern what social machines it is plugged into and how these machines work. One example, not articulated directly by

machine, the body without organs or the line of fl ight. Importantly, however, whatever it is called, this virtual plane is never separate, neither prior nor ante- rior to any of the actual structures – social, economical, psychological or lin- guistic – that Deleuze and Guattari consider. It is important to note three aspects of Deleuze and Guattari’s endeavour. First, Deleuze and Guattari never abandon the basic principle of the unity of the actual and the virtual and the univocity of Being. Second, they valorize those assemblages which make the virtual more apparent or more active within the actual; and third, the ultimate aim of their project is an articulation of the virtual movement which is presupposed by all of the actual structures they inves- tigate. Throughout their writing this aim is made clear: what they designate variably as the molecular, micropolitical, rhizomatic, nomadic and so on, is

the nature of these movements, Deleuze and Guattari introduced the notion of the tetravalence of the assemblage (see figure I.2, above), which allows both for a mapping and for a cartography of its constitutive elements. They also insisted on the profound and inseparable interconnection between different notions that define an ecology of concepts: rhizome, strata, stratification, assemblage, plane of consistency, deterritorialisation, abstract machines, diagram, phylum, and mechanosphere. Together, as they are presented in the last and conclusive plateau of A Thousand Plateaus, all these concepts disclose a logic of multipli- cities that is based upon the core concept of assemblage and that stresses the nomadic, fluid, and problematic nature of knowledge and of artistic practices. 1.4.

Looking beyond identity: language and desire 111 conceptualization of desire, regardless of whether or not one elects to adopt Deleuze and Guattari’s entire analytical ediﬁce, is that it foregrounds desire as something that is continually being dis/re/assembled. Thus, attention can focus on whether and how different kinds of relations emit desire, fabricate it and/or block it, exhaust it. Deleuze and Guattari’s rejection of psychoanalysis as the ﬁnal arbiter of desire is not without problems – Judith Butler, for example, has commented that a reason she has not engaged with their work in her writing is that ‘they don’t take prohibition seriously and I do’ (Butler 1999: 296). But the French philosophers’ critical stance towards psychoanalysis does direct attention to desire without requiring that we derive all its formations from a particular source or a speciﬁc constellation of psycho-soc…

has taught us much about desire. Once the question of desire, a question that is both at the very heart of Derrida’s philosophical project and has been irreversibly altered by his attention to it, is evoked, even the desire to attest to the impotence of deconstructive desires today, we contend that the idea of deconstruction’s demise seems woefully simplistic. If critical momentum in European philosophy and theory has seemed to shift away from deconstruction over the past decade or so, nevertheless the indebtedness of contemporary key thinkers to Derrida’s writing and to the entire project of deconstruction is unquestionable, regardless of whether it is always fully acknowledged, and whether or not Derrida’s influence manifests itself as a source of inspiration or the grounds of critical antagonism

In this text, then, woman becomes central to poetic creation through the sublimation of the erotic and the regendering of desire into a ritual of cultural production. In essence, the woman who has been sentenced to write by the scevian example now ironically sentences herself to immortality by facilitating the establishment of a structure of exchange that undermines the totalizing effect of individual mastery. At the moment of apparent retreat, du Guillet attributes to herself the power to endow Apollo with deity while at the same time permitting Sceve to find the path to spiritua…

itself; such a realization opens the way to many unexpected and therefore provocative perils; it could not be otherwise. The first danger is the vulgarity of popular art and Kitsch, due to the lack of the aesthetic direction provided in the past by the idea of Beauty. Not secondary is the danger represented by the constant changes in styles. It would be preposterous to lament the swiftness of these changes; it is significant, however, that with postmodernity a return to the past has taken place in music and architecture. A perhaps gracious but uninspiring eclecticism has taken hold of public squares and streets; the concession to coloristic ornamentation reveals that desire itself is lacking in thoughtfulness and directives. Desire is looking back, a tendency that was already contemplated by Hegel with his thesis that art must finally vanish. The search for the newan aesthetic category that finds no easy application and for

table linguistically, in this order, as appropriate things to want (see below for the link between this and other surface accounts). The fulfilment of these demands, however, does not yield satisfaction. For what the child actually wants is the impossible plenitude of union with another, which is impossible once they have become subjects. Consequently the apparent intentional objects of desire are merely its vehicles. The apparent satisfaction of the intentional objects of demands leaves a residual desire (for Lacan unconscious) for the imagined but impossible union with the other, which can never be satisfied. The lack of satisfaction of the imaginary desire then prompts another series of demands. The sense of lack fuels the desiring process. In the words of Bruce Fink Desire, strictly speaking has no object. In its essence, desire is a constant search for something else, and there is no specifiable object that is capable of satisfying

tions, interactions, and transversal paths between them. With the concept of assemblage (which will be thoroughly discussed below), totally new modes of thinking and apprehending art objects emerge: not unitarian monuments, but heterogeneously constituted multiplicities; not primarily meaning-oriented realisations, but stimulating asignifying ruptures; not extensive measurements of quantities (mapping), but intensive explorations of qualities (cartography); not the search for an “essence” of the artwork, but an adventurous exploration of its manifold and heteroclite constitutive parts and flows. Assemblage offers the possibility for a thought and a praxis outside fixed structures, laws, and axiomatic principles, enabling the positive fabrication of new materialities issuing from intensive, dynamic processes, in ever-changing configurations, definitions, and modes of emergence. …

including Deleuze and Guattari. The utopia once foreseen has turned to dust. As a result, we are left with a veritable remodelling of the unconscious with retrofit molar identities and shrink-wrapped capitalist subjectivities, and our time is now more cynical about any realistic change. Critics will ask: what are the prospects for revolutionary machinic desire and for molecular revolution when the proletarian class is no more? Our answer is that even in the politically bleak years of Guattari and indeed for us, the ecosophically prescient writings of Guattari intimate at the perpetual emergence of new modes of valourization in everyday life – friendship, sexual identity, the transformation of work, a new sense of solidarity, a new ethico-aesthetic paradigm and new forms of resistance. We hear the refrain again and again, that capitalism produces subjectivity the same way it prod…
