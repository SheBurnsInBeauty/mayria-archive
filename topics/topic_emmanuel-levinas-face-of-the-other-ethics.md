us to the Other. It is not my contention that Shoah constitutes a straight- forward ﬁlmic illustration of Levinas’s philosophy, let alone an exemplary model of Levinasian ethics in action. On the contrary, it will become clear that key aspects of Lanzmann’s approach as a ﬁlmmaker are directly at odds with the modes of relating envisaged by Levinas. What I am suggesting instead is that Levinas and Lanzmann pose questions to each other which can alter our understanding of the work of each. The chapter concludes with some remarks on the broader implications of Levinas’s thought for ﬁlm and spectatorship, and vice versa, focusing on the ethical potentialities of the image as interface between self and other.

Postmodern philosophers, in contrast, have sought to escape the treacherous orbit of the subject. They blame the “subject,” its hubris and narcissistic predilections. Many have rallied behind Emmanuel Levinas’s philosophy of the Other, in which the “face” is said to effect a rupture with philosophy as usual. Pace Heidegger, Levinas boldly affirms “ethics as first philosophy,”12 elevating the encounter with the concrete Other above all else. With Levinas, the face is that which transcends the economy of the Same, the reduction of the unknown to the known, the unfamiliar to the familiar. The face exceeds

Introduction Levinas's place in the popular philosophical imagination can be summed up in the phrase 'ethics as first philosophy'.1 In the Anglo-American philo- sophical world Levinas is best known for having reintroduced the question of ethics into the so-called 'Continental' philosophical tradition. Furthermore, it is through Levinas's profound yet often hidden influence that the 'Other' has become one of the key concepts in much contemporary work, not only in philosophy but also, for example, in feminist and postcolonial theory. How- ever, the main thesis of this book is that a description of Levinas's funda- mental philosophical project is by no means exhausted by any reference to 'ethics'; indeed that the emphasis on 'ethics' and 'the Other' in the reception and dissemination of Levinas's thought has served to cover over both the basis and the specific details of this project. Levin…

recognizes the other’s irreducibility to her or himself. For Levinas, this recogni­ tion deﬁnes ethics: the subject is constituted as a fundamental acknowledgement of the other. The subject is therefore founded upon her or his ethical response – a confrontation with the alterity of the other, which Levinas calls the ‘face’. He writes, ‘The way in which the other presents himself, exceeding the idea of the other in me, we here name face. This mode does not consist in ﬁguring as a theme under my gaze, in spreading itself forth as a set of qualities forming an image. The face of the Other at each moment destroys and overﬂows the plastic image it leaves me . . . It does not manifest itself by these qualities . . . It expresses itself.’36 Clearly, Levinas is not concerned with the image of the other, but rather how the other exceeds that image, and thereby exceeds the subject’s knowl…

writes, against Levinas: ‘the true ethical step is the one beyond the face of the other, the one of suspending the hold of the face, the one of choosing against the face, for the third. This coldness is justice at its most elemen­ tary.’ (Ibid., p. 50) I will not take a stance here on whether Žižek’s assess­ ment of Levinas is accurate—although I can say that I do think he touches a blind-spot in Levinas’ thought. Nevertheless, I do not think Žižek’s statement can sidestep the crucial question of the impasse of reason, namely the challenge of how we avoid justice being simply an arbitrary stipulation of a particular power-discourse—and thereby constitute jus­ tice as privileging, that is, as unjust. So, while it might be true that we must leave behind Levinas’ conception of the I-you relationship in order to reach the meaning of ethics, I nevertheless contend that it is only thr…

for the ethical implications of poststructuralism, noting, for example, the signiﬁ cance of the work of phenomenologist Emmanuel Levinas for Derrida’s ideas. Among Levinas’s contributions was an ethics dependent on the recognition of the radical alterity of the other: a uniquely inter- human obligation that arises from what Levinas describes as the “relation with something which for ever remains other”

The guru of the second main trend within the turn to ethics is Emmanuel Levinas, whose ethical philosophy is drawn upon to demonstrate that some forms of deconstruction and poststructuralism blend well with an ethical reading of texts and that a post-foundational ethics in not only possible but also preferable. J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Harpham, Drucilla Cornell, Andrew Gibson and Christopher Falzon, among others, have aligned themselves with this theoretically informed brand of ethics. For them, Literary Theory is not inimical to ethics, but is rather what makes an in-depth regeneration of ethics possible. To sum up the interests of this second group: they combine the insights of Literary Theory—a mistrust of foundations and master narratives, an utter undecidability, and a concern for textuality—with the preoccupations of Levinas, aptly summarised by Eskin in the following…

the otherness of the other and in this sense, ethics and justice were equiva- lent terms for Lévinas. In the later work by contrast, ethics is the primor- dial relation while justice is now the measuring work of philosophy. Justice is not unrelated to ethics but is nourished by it in the sense that the calcula- tions of philosophy are pursued for the sake of the responsibility of the sub- ject before the other. In this way, a path is opened for the possible vindica- tion of philosophy against the charges of hubris, tyranny, and corruption. The point is that in returning to an even more nuanced use of the categories of the erotic, Lévinas is able to defend philosophy while retaining a funda- mental respect for what is other to thought. That is to say that attentive 31 In the preface to the German edition of Totality and Infini…

Introduction 5 to say, however, that Levinas voices the unconditional side of hospitality, while Kant voices the conditional, since both advocate an unremitting pos- ture of ethical ﬁ delity. In essence, Kant’s ethical system advances reason’s self-regulating prop- erties as means to disclose universal values and imperatives. Levinasian ethics presents something more discomﬁ ting, in part because it is not a system, but rather a mode of witnessing. Levinasian ethics witnesses the random and unavoidable onset of a perilous encounter with the breakdown of knowledge frames that are based on instrumental codes of separation and immunizing distance. One of the master tropes for this encounter in Levinas’s idiom turns on the elusive yet compelling appearance of the “face of the Other.”13 Face here refers not simply to what is available to vision and knowledge, but to what exceeds suc…

cessible other is incalculable. As we will see in Chapters 3 and 4, especially when I pay attention to the face of the perpetrator, we cannot reverse the dialectics of mastery – Lévinas is interested only in the transcendence of ‘the weakest of the weak’ (Cooper 2006: 24). This is, perhaps, one of the most challenging and difficult ethical imperatives underpinning Lévinas’ logic. In other words, even if we reduce the other to an association with the position of the perpetrator, who certainly fails or has failed to see the other’s ‘nudity’, our ethical encounter with the other’s face remains unconditionally predicated on our non-sovereign, un-predetermined, com-passionate hospitality. This leaves us entirely exposed to our shared, yet asymmetrical, vulnerabilities. Book Outline This book is, then, about the relationship of aesthetics, ethics and trauma in Almodóvar’s cinema. It…

the symbolic order. As an alternative to Levinas, Žižek turns to Primo Levi and his account of the Muselmann, which helps to recast the Other beyond a postmodern Levinasian-inflected ethics. If Žižek criticizes Levinas’s “ethical petrification” (LC, 165) of otherness, he praises Levi’s disclosure of the Other—the Muselmann—a being radically stripped of its symbolic veneer, resistant to the subject’s imaginary projection (the Other as alter ego), and refused the human privilege of intersubjectivity. In contrast to Levinas’s gentrification of the face—what amounts to an imaginary-symbolic Other—Levi portrays the Muselmann as faceless: “When confronted with a Muselmann, one cannot discern in his face the trace of the abyss of the Other in his/her vulnerability, addressing us with the infinite call of our responsibility. What one gets instead is a kind of blind wall, lack of depth…

grapples at length with these questions in Totality and Inﬁnity and his other key work, Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence (1974), where the difﬁculty of describing, without betraying, the ethical ‘relation without relation’ entails a disruption of textuality and a search for new forms of ethical articulation.12 For Levinas, ethics, the exposure to the Other, incurs an interrogation not only of the self but also of the very language of ethical investigation. Levinas’s writings have been credited with transforming our understanding of ethics in the Western humanities, and many of his key terms – otherness, responsibility, encounter, the face-to-face – have been seamlessly incorpo- rated into contemporary critical discourse. However, this almost ubiquitous acceptance and appropriation may have come at a price. Taking stock of Levinas’s legacy, Davis warns against what he sees as a prev…

to be responsible for that face. For Amiel-Houser and Mendelson-Maoz, the ethi- cal difficulty is to visualize the other person/character as a “radical alterity, totally exterior and inaccessible” (206) and simultaneously be on their side to help them. However, while interpreting Levinas, they touch upon the fact that the reader/critic might disrespectfully cross the boundaries between himself and what he reads (207). To understand the desired, though not defined as the ideal, state of mind that the new ethical criticism aims to discuss, Gregory’s explanations and remarks about the transforming nature of the reading process are worth referring to. He, in a way, redefines the empathetic identification as a feeling or rather as a reverberating “influ- ence” of the text upon the reader/critic; from the perspective of new ethical criticism, the literary text invites the reader to reformulate what they imitate in the interactive

tion of agonistic politics: it uncovers a peculiar “de-realization” of the crit­ ical subject in the process of judging a “de-realized” historical object. If we wish to preserve for this de-realization the ethical name of obligation, we risk contaminating what Levinas calls the eschatological dimension of ethics by the “pagan” historicity of the polemos. Yet, this risk is worth taking; in­ deed, to use Levinas’s words, it is “a very fine risk,” which enables us to exit the philosophical discussion of the history of war, aptly characterized by Levinas as “the ontology of totality,” and to confront instead the differends of history. As I have argued, Levinas himself undertakes such a risk in his writings on human rights when he redefines obligation as a struggle for the rights of others. In a more radical way, Lyotard allows us to displace and reinscribe the opposition between his…

and the Other, books that articulate the foundations of his philosophy. Levinas’s work conﬂ ates our endless desire for otherness with our lived experience of the inﬁ nite. He argues that the subject is always beholden to the other, and as such, we are deﬁ ned by otherness. In staking this claim, Levinas forgoes the articulation of an autonomous, rational subject that has dominated Western philosophy since its inception. As a counter to the prominence of existentialism in his day, Levinas rejects the possibility that our lives emerge from and unfold against a backdrop of nothingness. For Levinas, we exist against a pervasive vigilance, a presence, against which we are always objectiﬁ ed. In Levinas, otherness is inescapable, even when we are most alone. Where traditional philosophy pursues knowledge, Levinas privileges goodness before all: as such, his radical ethics have been labeled “post- rational.”8 Eschewing objective fact is now a central tenet of most

by the requirements of prudence and justice. Justice is not simply a relation between anonymous citizens. It bears on our treatment of the Other as well. This is one of several reasons why no sharp distinction between ethics and politics can be sustained, a topic we shall be returning to in our Conclusion. For Derrida as for Levinas, Otherness is a matter of absolute singularity, ‘inaccessible, solitary, transcendent, non-manifest . . .’.26 Solitary, because while ethics is a matter of right relations between oneself and others, it is not in the Realists’ view a question of sharing one’s life with them. As far as that goes, ethical Realism is as anti-social as the Kant whose gigantic bulk continues to overshadow it. In good, old-fashioned, deontological style, such an ethics bears on our obligations to others, not our enjoyment of them. Otherness here is not primarily the g…

of the other. The thought of the Prench Jewish philosopher, Emmanuel Levinas, has fast acquired the canonicity in modem philosophy that Maimonides has in medieval Jewish philosophy. His thinking, above all, has made Judaism available to the end oC philosophy - philosophy which has discovered that it has no ethics, and which turns to Judaism as the sublime other of moder- nity. Levinas's Buddhist Judaism offers an extreme version of Athens versus Jerusalem. Knowledge, power and practical reason are attributed to the model of the autonomous, bounded, separ- ated, individual self, the sell within the city, 'the alllance of logic and politics'. The self, according to this new ethics, cannot expe- rience truly transConning loss, but plunders the world for the booty of its self-seeking interest. To become ethical, this self is to be dev- astated, traumatised, unthroned, by the command…

departs from one’s expectations. To further explore this disarticulation between the subject and the world, as well as the viewer and the artwork, art historians have turned to Emmanuel Levinas’ understanding of ethics, particularly the paradigmatic encounter of the ‘face-to-face’ which he describes in Totality and Inﬁnity. For Levinas, the subject is constituted as a response to the other’s appeal or demand for recognition. Essentially, the other calls the subject into being – an imperative for the subject to differentiate itself. The other’s command is the initial moment that the subject recognizes the other’s irreducibility to her or himself. For Levinas, this recogni- tion deﬁnes ethics: the subject is constituted as a fundamental acknowledgement of the other. The subject is therefore founded upon her or his ethical response – a confrontation with the alterity of the other, which Lev…

as an 'identity', located as a being in space and time. The otherness of the other is, for Levinas, the precondition of the sameness of self. Thus the other necessarily poses the ethical question: the response to the other's appeal is the field of ethics. Otherness is thus not conceived on the Hegelian model of mutual recognition of two equal self-conscious subjects; rather,

approaches to and incites responses from the subject. In short, the other calls, beckons, summons up the subject. The subject, for Levinas, is exposed to and opened up by the appeal of the other. The other opens (up) the subject to others; it opens (up) things, the world itself, to the subject. It enables the world to have meanings, to be open to other senses. The subject is chosen by the other, and is thus not the active agent of moral choice. By facing the subject, the other makes the subject responsible for actions, and even crimes, which are not his or her own. The other's behaviour is the subject's responsibility, even if it is beyond the subject's control. The other necessarily implicates the subject from the outside. In being chosen by the other, the subject is positioned as an 'identity', located as a being in space and time. The otherness of the other is, for Levina…

8. Interpretations of what Levinas is actually up to in his ethical thought vary, rang- ing from Richard Cohen’s robust reading of it as an ethical exegesis “that supplies a reason for philosophy, a reason for knowledge and a reason for living” (2001, 17), John Llewelyn’s view of it as a “protoethics” (1991b, 4), Derrida’s interpretation as a phenomenological inquiry into the meaning of moral obligation and “the ethics of ethics” (1999, 4–5), to Robert Bernasconi’s construal of Levinas’s work an eth- ics of suspicion or “ethics against ethics” that puts every specific ethical account to the test (1990, 40). Levinas scholar Diane Perpich likewise contends that Levinas’s thought does not provide a system of justified rules for right conduct nor is it however completely divorced from a normative dimension. Taking the relation to the other as the sine qua non for ethics as such, Levinas is construed by Perpich as articulating

scendence of the Good. Accordingly, Levinas condemns every form of self-love as a corruption of the ethical relation, and prescribes that the subject should devote itself entirely to the other. To be ethical is for Levinas to be purely disinterested, to take re- sponsibility for the other without seeking any recognition on one's own behalf. 19 lt suffices, however, to place yourselfface-to-face with someone else to realize that the asymmetry assumed by Levinas is self-refuting. If you and I are standing in front of each other, who is the other? The answer can only be doubly affirmative since "the other" is an interchangeable term that shifts referent depending on who pronounces the words. 1 am an other for the other and vice versa, as Derrida reinforces in "Violence and Metaphysics." Derrida's argument not only contradicts Levinas's idea of the absolutely Other, but also underc…

style, such an ethics bears on our obligations to others, not our enjoyment of them. Otherness here is not primarily the ground of friendship and afﬁ nity; instead, it is reiﬁ ed to an absolute condition, in which one’s friends and neighbours become as awesomely inaccessible as the Satanic view of Yahweh. The terror that others will seek to assimilate us to themselves – the mighty neurosis of the postmodern – is now so acute that it licenses a mutual impenetrability. For the Lacanians, this is where ethics must begin. We must shape an existence with others founded on this shared strange- ness. For Levinas and Derrida, an acknowledgement of this fearful opacity is often enough where ethics ends. In the writings of Alain Badiou, perhaps the most inﬂ uential of all contem- porary French philosophers, the Real becomes the Event – that miraculous occurrence which surges up from an hi…

to the work of Levinas where 'responsibility to the Other' exists 'pre-originally' and "an-archically"." This has proved most fortuitous in the desire to reintroduce ethics into theory at a time when political correctness is everything and when ethics had virtually been eliminated from the mainstream of theoretical debate, thanks to those very theories which would have done away with it, namely structuralism and poststructuralism; likewise the New Historicism that descends from Foucault, although not the New Historicist practice ofJerome McGann which Brook Thomas (as already stated) identifies as a separate strand'' and the cultural materialism deriving from Raymond Williams. I would argue that the interest in 'the Other' is a consequence of the unac- knowledged necessity of theory to ground itself in an anthropological universal given, since 'the Other' can certainly and rather simplistically be argued to be everywhere - something

other and its concerns take precedence above those of the self, with the latter placed in a position of passivity, called to an unbounded responsibility for and responsivity to each and every other person. The origin of ethics does not lie, then, in the self’s freedom but comes from the demand of the other; Levinas states that, “The responsibility for the other can not have begun in my com- mitment, in my decision” (1981, 10). Yet it is important not to underestimate the violence and tumult the subject often experiences in the encounter with otherness, which shatters one’s self-understanding and reorients the agent’s experiences as such. The incomprehensibility of the other’s alterity eerily mirrors the onto- logical insubstantiality of the specter, in its frustration of technological attempts to record it or, when caught on film, its inexplicable manipulation of technological devices, which it turns back on their users. There is also a

comfortably between opposing or competing political systems, for we no longer subscribe to any such totalising forms; but we can address the instance, the events, of justice. Here lies the basis of an ethical demand in the postmodern, a demand whose philosophical roots lie in the work of a thinker such as Levinas. We must judge: there is no escape from the necessity of judging in any specific case. Yet we have no grounds upon which to base our judging. This is akin to Levinas: I have spoken a lot about the face of the Other as being the original site of the sensible. ... The proximity of the Other is the face’s meaning, and it means in a way that goes beyond those plastic forms which forever try to cover the face like a mask of their presence to perception. But always the face shows through these forms. Prior to any particular expression and beneath all particular expressions, which cover over and

from within the constitution of subjectivity. The notion of proximity that becomes so important in Otherwise than Being is in fact a key term in the description of erotic subjectivity in Totality and Infinity. This does not, of course, mean that ethics becomes sexual in the later work, but only that Lévinas attempt to think together the embodied and spiritual aspects of the encounter with alterity. There had always been a wedge between these two in the earlier work as there is, according to certain critics, in Platonic ontol- ogy. An important advance arising from this shift of emphasis is Lévinas’s resolution of the problem of the ‘the third’ or the problem of the second face. In the earlier work, only infinite desire for the face could do justice to the otherness of the other and in this sense, ethics and justice were equiva- lent terms for Lévinas. In the later work by contr…

16 Introduction fulﬁlled but that are neither forced on one nor enforceable. In particular, I investigate the ethical resistance that comes not from power but from lack of power. The resistance of the completely powerless Other is perhaps paradoxically the most powerful form that resistance can take. Levinas’s writings on the face of the Other and Derrida’s meditations on the relevance of death to ethics are signs of the ethical turn in Continental philosophy that occurs in the 1980s and the 1990s. This ethical turn may well have been a result of criticisms of poststructuralism for being at least inattentive to and at worst unable to explain normative issues. If there is to be a deconstructive genealogy, it must provide at least some examples of how it understands itself in relation to ethics. Chapter 5 explores poststructuralism’s abstention from critical theory’s use of both the method…

behaves as a law or limit, initiating the whole system. If this is the case, the ethical subject will be subjected or called to account by an alterity which is determinedly other, other in the face-to-face relation as a rule. Ironically, then, the extreme responsibility and non-violence of Levinas’ ethical structure (which never forces “choice” or “presence”) carries with it a different threat of violence by effacing the specificity of the other in its equation with absolute otherness. It risks creating another abstracted “position” for the Other, where its rôle within and possible interruption of the existent / historical order will always be secondary to the law of its otherness. It is at this point that the debate over the anxiety of alterity and the temporal order has clear implications for feminism. For while the feminist project is all about making room for the other,…

of intentionality’ (Levinas, 1986a: 353). Levinas prioritizes ethics ahead of philosophical thought and the primacy it gives to the self. In his writing the concept of existence is subordinate to the transcendence of an otherness which is not definable in terms of identity. Levinas makes his challenge to the philosophical privileging of self within the context of the centrality of metaphors of light and vision in the history of Western philosophy. As is the case with Merleau-Ponty, much of Levinas’s work is an engagement with and response to the phenomenological systems of Husserl and Heidegger. Levinas engages critically with the ideal existence of consciousness in Husserl’s phenomenology and with Being in Heidegger’s phenomenology. However, I will not be discussing Levinas’s work in direct relation to either of these two philosophers.1 I will be focusing on the extent to which Levinas …

Badiou Badiou’s Ethics: An Essay on the Understanding of Evil (1998) constitutes an attack both on humanistic concepts of ethics and on the kinds of ethical premise associated with Levinas’s privileging of the Other. Both of these he terms ‘“ethical” ideology’ and he associates them with sentimental ideologies of contemporary liberalism. Badiou’s account discusses two realms of experience: ‘knowledge’ and ‘truth’. The former is everyday, factual and attainable.

something taken up by a self from a position of freedom or will, but an a priori demand from which the self emerges and according to which it must account for its actions. The other of Levinas’s ethics is not the ‘other’ of cultural discourse, which all-too-often functions as a marker of exotic difference, but, rather, an irreducible alterity at the heart of the self. Levinas’s ethics begin with the relation itself and not with two terms (self/other), hence its influence on Barad’s account of entanglement and intra-action, both of which relocate the idea of exteriority within phenomena.

sense: not as a simple separation from the Other, from all symbolic structures and the social mediation of the subject’s being, but as the separation of the Other from the object that drives its structure. There is, however, a whole school of contemporary ethical reflection, inspired more or less directly by Emmanuel Levinas, which has as its central point precisely the affirmation (and fortification) of the enigma of the Other. In this ethics, the subject is confronted, or has to be confronted with, the enigma of the Other – a Demand in relation to which the subject is absolutely responsible. We have seen above how psychoanalysis brings to light the fact that the constitution of the enigma of the Other, the elevation of the latter to the place of an infinite enigmatic Demand, is the precise counterpart of (primal) repression. This does not prevent repression from necessaril…

What Is Response Ethics? xxxi others as you would have them do unto you, is a prime example of seeing the other always regarding the self. Levinasian ethics begins with the premise that every other is radically other and not the same as myself. Contra Husserlian phenomenology, I can- not know the other through some analogy to myself such that I know that for me when I do X it means Y and, therefore, when I see another person do X, for them, it must also mean Y. Levinasian ethics and responsibility operate beyond any assumptions of the self-same and beyond recognition of an- other’s behavior through knowledge of one’s own. Rather than begin with rational self-legislation or a good will ala Immanuel Kant, or considering the consequences of one’s actions ala Jeremy Bentham or John Stuart Mill, or developing a virtuous character ala Aristotle, Levianisian ethics begins with our embodiment, s…

was especially noteworthy for its elevation of ethics to first philosophy: our infinite responsibility to the Other as the primordial condition for any philosophizing. The antipodes of Levinas and Nietzsche, the mutual exclusivity of ethics and aesthetics, of responsibility to the Other and self- creation, polarized the discussion of ethics in French philosophy to a great extent. Thus, while Derrida devotes a substantial and well-known essay to Levinas in 1964, “Violence and Metaphysics,” he is quite critical, taking issue with Levinas’s reading of Heidegger in Totality and Infinity and noting that Levinas’s “ethics” is not an ethics per se but rather an “ethics of ethics.”59

INTRODUCTION 11 elaboration of the “psychic life” of ethics. Through the juxtaposition of Levinas’s ethics of responsibility and Kristeva’s ethics of “the irreconcilable,” I develop a psychoanalytic model of ethical relation to the Other, irreducible either to the narcissistic reflection of the ego Ideal or to the fetishistic em­ bodiment of the abject in social relations. By pushing Kristeva’s and Levinas’s ethics toward their limits, I define such a model as the interplay be­ tween the sublimation of the death drive and the confrontation with the ab­ ject as one’s own most intimate yet inassimilable alterity. By rethinking the conditions of ethical responsibility in the context of the libidinal economy of the drive, I contest the separation of ethics not only from embodiment and sensibility but also from conflict and sexuality. Kristeva’s ethics of democracy is crucial for und…

of the Other.”13 Face here refers not simply to what is available to vision and knowledge, but to what exceeds such protocols—an exposure that troubles the familiar contours of what it means to be in relation. Tellingly, the na- ture of the disturbance that Levinas describes ﬁ nds expression in the idiom of hospitality. Entering Levinas’s world means discovering the disorient- ing proximity between the rather appealing idea that “the subject is a host,” and the deliberatively provocative depiction of where this leads: “subjectiv- ity is being hostage.”14 Gift-giving morphs into an uncontrollable event of being given over to the unknowable. This small taste of Levinas’s language goes a long way toward explaining the clear and strident dissensus in Levinas studies over his ethical vision’s political implications. As Richard Wolin points out, the suspicion lingers that in Levinas’s …

However, on Levinas's own account it turns out that such an approach de facto is unten- able, since the encounter between two is called into question by "the third" (le tiers), who interrupts the ethical relation and demands that we consider others than the Other. We are thus caught up in what Levinas designates as the domain of the political, where it is necessary to interrogate and calculate intersubjective relations in order to achieve social justice. Levinas 's observation does not, however, entail that he renounces his no- tion of a singular, ethical encounter with the Other, which would precede the political. Instead, he holds that the political community should be guided by the respect for the Other, who here turns out to be no one Jess than God the Father, recalling us to "the human fraternity." Even if one disregards the theologico-patriarchal humanism in Levinas's line …

makes its analysis in terms of empathy so fruitful. As Ben stares at faces in a magazine, he expresses an injunction that becomes the reader’s injunction: “It was my responsibility to imagine who they might be” (221).

and the structures and mechanisms that enable it. Emmanuel Levinas’ ethics of love is outlined in Chapter 4 along with a reading of Marguerite Duras’s ﬁlm script Hiroshima, mon amour. Levinas distinguishes between the egoism of erotic pleasure and the self- less love of ethical responsibility, demarcating Eros from Agape in his account of ethics and politics. Nevertheless, love is central to these ethical and political relations modifying even the reasoned judgements of justice. For Levinas ethics is the relation to the Other and within this relation we are required to take responsibility for the Other, prioritising her needs over our own. Politics introduces other Others, the broader community, and also the need to judge between the competing needs of these many Others requiring justice rather than responsibility. Yet ethics and politics are not distinct, as all ethical relations alread…

Desires: Levinas’s extraordinarily absolute otherness, both as locus of desire and as self- deﬁ nition, compels a fantastic, productive rethink- ing of the subject–other dyad. In what follows, there is no intention to argue the pragmatic viability of Levinas’s terms – as Steven Connor, employing Derrida, has already discussed in Theory and Cultural Value, Levinas’s unknowable other is a problematic absolute unto itself, while his sustained refusal to map out a coherent ethics underscores the dif- ﬁ culty of applying his principles to literature. Levinasian thought clearly

approaches without touching. Its way is not an action, but is the social relation.' These deliberate and careful formulations indicate that in any apparent identity statement such as 'ethics is metaphysics' the meaning of the 'is' is not to be taken for granted, any more than the meaning of 'ethics' or 'metaphysics' themselves. My contention — one not entirely absent in the existing literature on Levinas, but here elaborated in much greater detail — i that for Levinas ethics is the way to metaphysics, that 'ethics' is the phenom- enological elaboration or experiential attestation of a more fundamental metaphysical claim that would reassert the necessity of a thinking of 'tran- scendence' as a first principle. The elaboration of this thesis gives an importance and a centrality to certain themes in Levinas's work which have often been sidelined, when not wholly overlooked: eros, sexual dif…

explains why regardless of culture, still today, there is no limit to the rage of propagandists when they call for murder. The moment that their victim’s face reminds terror’s bureaucrats and their subordinates that killing is im- possible, the moment that the face imposes its transcendence as an obsta- cle to their reductions, they must steel themselves against the injunction not to kill—to eclipse, in other words, the responsibility that is still evoked by the vulnerability and the mortality of the other. Levinas shows over and over again that if ethics conserves a meaning, it is entirely due to the way that we confront this test of the per sis tence and re sis tance of the face, the irreducibility of a core transcendence and freedom, in which opens up an inappropriable world and which is always offered singularly. From this perspective, it is not by chance that Levinas disc…

ject. It is a line of questioning without the expectation of an answer, and is itself, continuously and rigorously, placed under question. For Levinas this is the very deﬁnition of ethics: “a calling into question” of the limits of the subject through its exposure to “the Other [l’Autre].” “The strangeness of the Other,” Levinas writes, “his irreducibility to the I [Moi], to my thoughts and my possessions, is precisely accomplished [s’accomplit] … as ethics” (1969, 43). Elsewhere, Levinas refers to ethics as “a spiritual optics” (1969, 78) – a way of perceiv- ing what exceeds the physical and psychic limits of the eye and the mind. Understood this way, ethics is also a form of poetry: a way of embodying, of making “present” the fundamental self- reﬂexivity of human being. It could also be said that poetry 49 Poetry and Belief

poreality, life, enjoyment, sensibility, suffering, pain, passivity and so on – in a way which also puts the symbolic at arm’s length. Like Lacan, Levinas seems to assume (falsely, as we shall see) that ethics is primarily about obligation; but to stage this obligation as a matter of ﬂ esh and living pres- ence, self and inimitable Other, is to rescue the idea from what can be seen as the less palatable, aridly rationalist aspects of the Kantian tradition. In one sense, the law is non-identical with the Other, since it is bestowed from some place inﬁ nitely beyond both him and myself. In another sense, the law is no less than this Other in person. Deontology becomes phenom- enology, as the intolerable millstone of the moral law becomes incarnate in the well-nigh unbearable burden of the other’s ineluctable demand. The harshness of the Kantian moral law remains ﬁ rmly in place; bu…

22 Introduction Unspeakable. Levinas achieves three goals, linked but distinct. They operate on dif- ferent levels. He shows, in the ﬁrst place, that the ‘‘surplus validity’’ or ‘‘semantic excess’’ of normative ethical concepts (for instance, responsibil- ity) can be regulated only according to a normative dimension or context that is also (but in a different way) excessive. But in the second place, and relatedly, Levinas also shows the instability of the distinction between the concrete instance of judgment (this or that circumstance arises and a deci- sion must be taken: for instance, the decision to sacriﬁce constitutionality to the life of the city, as Levin might phrase it, or the decision to entertain the supposititious scenario he outlines in the ﬁrst place), the normative concept we apply in making the decision (responsibility, or the possibility and value of weighing one life and many), and the normative context stipu-

that holds no secrets, which exhibits itself in pornographic nakedness and hands itself over to total visibility and consumption. Although Levinas does not glimpse the erotic abysses that find expression as excess and madness, his ethics of eros points unambiguously to the negativity of the Other: sacrosanct, atopic otherness, which, in today’s increasingly narcissistic society, is vanishing. Moreover, Levinas’s ethics of eros can be reformulated as resistance to the economic reification of the Other. Otherness is not consumable differ­ ence. Capitalism is eliminating otherness wholesale in order to subordinate everything to consumption. Eros, however, represents an asymmetrical relationship to the Other. As such, it interrupts the exchange rate. Otherness admits no bookkeeping. It does not appear in the balance of debt and credit.

within the categories of our own making is, for Derrida, the crucial moment in the ethical relation. Nonetheless Derrida himself does not always avoid this trap. Frequently the metaphor of femininity or woman is used in his writings as a metaphor for otherness itself, or for the indeterminacy of that which escapes fixity. Levinas, in rejecting a ‘totalising’ conception of understanding, sees no understanding of the Other as adequate, or ethically acceptable, which conceptualises them within a system, for example, within a framework of psychological theory. For this will, in Hegelian fashion, impose our own view of the world upon them, locating them within that world, rather than responding to them as a voice from beyond it. The alternative is not to capitulate to the Other’s view. It is rather to respond to the Other as making demands prior to any specific view of the world. For Levinas, in contrast to Heidegger, such relationships are

too, was Irigaray, in her disagreements with him on the other and sexual difference. In another sense, unlike Beauvoir, Irigaray in ‘Questions to Emmanuel Levinas’ offers a necessary addition to, and not a mere dismissal of, Levinas’s ethics of alterity in which the feminine is the absolute other; Irigaray claims that there is no alterity/otherness without sexual difference.25 Crucially, for Irigaray, the problem is not otherness but the lack of sexual difference. The Le Doeuffian reading of Beauvoir is not difficult to present. Le Doeuff provides the necessary, critical focus by singling out a central passage on the category of Other in The Second Sex. But notice the subtle nature of Le Doeuff’s account: she selects a passage in Beauvoir’s text which also already reflects Beauvoir’s own feminist interpretation of French Hegelianism generally, including her own otherwise Hegelian experience of life; that is, Le Doeuff reads Beauvoir

admirers border on the exorbitant. Jill Robbins asserts that ‘within recent Continental philosophy, Emmanuel Levinas has decisively renewed the question of the ethical’,6 John Llewelyn adds that ‘his works demand not to be left unread’,7 and Derrida claims that ‘the repercussions of his thought will have changed the course of philo- sophical reﬂection in our time’.8 In recent years Levinas has acquired a stature and authority that are almost unchallengeable.9 Of an older gen- eration than most of the poststructuralists, Levinas played an important role in introducing the thought of Husserl and Heidegger in France in the 1930s, and most of his work for the ﬁrst three decades of his publish- ing career was in the ﬁeld of phenomenology. He was already in his mid-ﬁfties when, in 1961, he published Totalité et inﬁni, which gave an ethical inﬂection to phenomenology and would become the cornerstone of his huge philosophical inﬂuence. By the time he published his second

fering’ exists in a deeply pained relation to its very ethical possibility remains a troubling feature of Levinas’s thought. Towards the end of his essay, Levinas thus speaks of ‘a new modality in the faith of today, and even in our moral certitudes’ (p. 100), one he ties, here and elsewhere, to the Jewish faith as an eschewal of the ensem- ble of ideas one would associate with theodicy. (I explore further this aspect of Levinas’s writings in the final section of the third chapter of this book, ‘Distress II’.) To the extent that this assertion moves us in a somewhat Kantian direction, it once more calls for thinking about the secular or social world as much as the religious sphere, which must be remade if ‘useless suffering’ is not to utterly overwhelm ‘faith’ or ‘meaning’ in a way that signals the ultimate redundancy of ethics. Here, it is clear that the notion of the interhuman does not simply proceed

utterly other, the foundation of ethics, would in eff ect always have to take place on the outside. Th e encounter with the other, the response to the moral injunc- tion, would always have to occur “elsewhere,” to the extent that the very move- ment of the encounter in general, which Levinas calls “metaphysics,” is a move toward “somewhere else.” At the beginning of Totality and Infi nity, he presents a conception of metaphysical desire that absolutely opposes the Freudian defi - nition of the drive: In the most general form it has assumed in the history of thought [metaphys- ics] appears as a movement going forth from a world that is familiar to us, what- ever be the yet unknown lands that bound it or that hides it from view, from an “at home” which we inhabit, toward an alien outside- of- oneself, toward a yon- der. Th e term of this movement, the elsewhere or the other, is called other in an eminent sense. No journey, no change of climate or of scenery could satisfy

of this understanding of ethics has been that the representation of the other is now commonly conceived as a violent mechanism, which poses a conundrum to the degree that some sort of representation or intelligibility is requisite for recognition. Following Le Dœuff’s analysis of the philosophical imaginary, the issue that is most pertinent here is not whether Derrida is right or wrong in his deconstruction of the bond between friendship and enmity, or whether the Levinasian indictment of the primacy of ontology as “tyranny” is or is not philosophically valid. The more pressing concern is that these philosophical moves—among others—have bequeathed to us an imaginary wherein one

THE MOVE TO ETHICS: LYOTARD 93 himself is still too enmeshed in the philosophy of presence by thinking of Being as a coming-into-presence (Anwesen).212 In order to escape this intelligibility of presence, which he realizes is inevitable, in so far as language, and more specifically, philosophical language is marked by the Hellenic tradition, Levinas draws on the Hebraic biblical tradition which, by speaking of God and His alterity, privileges the ethical dimension of our relationship to the ‘other’, and discloses the themes of concern and responsibility for this alterity. Such a relationship cannot be reduced to a relationship of knowledge, nor can we assume a fundamental equality of being between the participants: God and I. This is not, as is clear in Levinas’ critique of Buber, a plea for a treatment of the ‘other’ as ‘a person’, a ‘Thou’ as opposed to an ‘It’, an object.213 The ethical recognition of the ‘otherness’

the absolutely other’ (65). In other words, Levinas’s move away from a philosophical tradition grounded on an ‘original incarnation of thought’ takes us, via a philosophical detour that urges a fresh appraisal of the philosophical notions of the visible, the ethical relation and difference, to another species of messianic eschatology that emphasises the ‘call’, the ‘waiting’ and the ‘face’ of the other, an other likened to God. The reader is then left wondering whether the dis- missal of incarnational thought through a commentary on the use of ﬂesh and incarnation in the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty and others, has, once again, taken us back to ‘phenomenological religiosity’ and to the problem of differentiating ‘confessional’ and philosophical writing. Jill Robbins suggests that Levinasian alterity is particularly revealing of hidden elements in language and ﬁguration because it ‘render[…

litical praxis and ethical obligation, between the disruptive temporality of becoming and the anarchic signification of otherness, and, finally, between political and ethical significance of embodiment. Drawing on the work of Robert Bemasconi, Drucilla Cornell, Simon Critchley, Tina Chanter, and Jacques Derrida, among others, I address what I consider to be still the most challenging task emerging from Levinas’s work: the necessity of contextualizing ethical obligation, which, as the infinite movement toward the Other, exceeds, nonetheless, all contextual bounds. Toward this end, I reread Levinas’s ethics in context of Luce Irigaray’s and Patricia Williams’s thought. Such an encounter between Levinas’s ethics, feminist theory of sexual difference, and race theory is mo­

Instead, in making the feminine 'other', Levinas opens up the bias of language and the bias of metaphysical desire. The question of sexual difference is brought into the arena of ontology and ethics. In this arena, where femininity is 'other' to philosophy, Levinas states his interests and hence falls into this pattern, but at the same time he addresses the relation and problematizes it. Thus the accusation of a simply reactionary attitude towards women becomes more difficult to make. Levinas attempts to reconsider the relation between women and concern for the interior space, which is both, in Levinas' terms, 'the dwelling' and 'being at home in the world'.13 This desire for an ethics based on community both looks back to what Levinas calls 'an unrecuper- ated, pre-ontological past of maternity', and forwards to reconcilia- tion. Nevertheless, Levinas is writing in a framework articulated in terms of sexual difference. Despite the attempts to disavow the 57

completely divorced from a normative dimension. Taking the relation to the other as the sine qua non for ethics as such, Levinas is construed by Perpich as articulating a series of normative considerations regarding the meaning of ethics and offering a description of how the alterity of the other commands one’s responsibility (2008, 11). 9. Dennis King Keenan also calls into question an inviolable distinction between the other and the il y a, alleging a complicity between the frankness characteristic of language and its shadow, the equivocation emerging from the il y a (1999, 17–18). John Caputo raises a variation of this criticism, collapsing the difference between the il y a and Levinas’s notion of illeity, the holiness by which the alterity of the other is preserved. Discussing the opacity of ethical obligation for Levinas, Caputo opines, “I am more inclined to believe that we cannot separate the il which is Him, God, which

of being impacts on the authenticity of my being-with-others. For Levinas, the other person’s testimony is the primary ethical moment, and it is only through this that I have access to the other in any real sense. Elgin’s concerns are in some ways closer to Husserl’s, bringing out the complexity of the social dimension in a way that Husserl never does, and bringing out the normativity of testimony at the opposite end of the spectrum from Levinas. For Elgin, testimony is like promising, in that it licenses the other to believe me, and in so doing shows more broadly how epistemological and ethical considerations overlay one another. Levinas focuses not on the license to 230 DISCLOSURE AND TESTIMONY

6 Introduction one of the goals of my excursion into Levinas’s contribution to the Sodom archive is to point up how his insights’ ﬁ gural traits give heft to his claim that the call for justice primordially arises from the everyday discrepancies and challenges that shape the rhythm of being in common with others. The call to “compare the incomparable” serves, in the ﬁ rst instance, as a reminder that the ethical relation is not an absolutely private affair or folie à deux in the delirium of inﬁ nite responsibility. To “compare the incom- parable” means to recognize that there are plural expressions of alterity to contend with—and to dwell with.17 Derrida’s debt to Levinas is famously complex and ambivalent, yet his insistence that the “dilemma” at hospitality’s heart is “irreducible” carries an unmistakable Levinasian accent. Radical vigilance, however, is not the only factor.…

The Other is not an operator­ – ­that would make it possible to think of myself as the Other of the Other, which would quickly lead to the view from nowhere­ – ­but a mark of exteriority.10 Levinas has championed a struggle against postulating a transcendence- free totality that will encompass both what is within and what is without, leaving no room for anything beyond. At first glance, it seems he has an ethical problem with totality: it is unfair and violent to the Other, for it converts the Other into something sub­ stantive. In fact, his ethical project can be described as the effort to rescue the Other­ – ­an indexical in an asymmetrical relation to the Same11­ – ­from substantives. To describe what is other in terms of substantives is to make it less other, to bring it to a common ground in a step towards totality. He compares the existence of the Other as such with the o…

According to Emmanuel Levinas, it is the responsibility for the Other that is the ‘essential, primary and fundamental structure’ of my subjectivity. Ethics, the impulse of moral duty, the urge to act on my own responsibility, are not the icing on the cake of my being, not supplements to being, or desirable but not necessary adornments of my existence; it is rather that ‘the very node of the subjective is knotted in ethics understood as responsibility’.30 I am because I am for others. For all practical intents and purposes, ‘being’ and ‘being for other’ are synonyms. The Face of the Other when it enters/bursts into my sight beckons to me, opening the possibility of escape from ‘the isola- tion of existing’ – and thereby calls me into being, which unlike mere ‘existence’ is inconceivable without sharing (‘existence’, Levinas reminds us, ‘is the sole thing I cannot communicate; I…

Introduction IX that I cannot see the innovative aspects of his work as found by others and, even if I could, Levinas's theology and ethics (even given the very broad conception he favors) fall outside the compass of this study. Whatever the continental philosophical tradition is today and whether it constitutes a dis- tinct philosophical tradition with a future does not depend, in my view, on understanding Levinas; at least it does not depend on it in the same way that it does on understanding Husserl. I am aware that such judgments, with the passing of time, may be found wanting in both detail and emphasis. It will be apparent, for instance, that Jean-Paul Sartre, who would have loomed especially large in a book such as this one some twenty or thirty years ago, shrinks quite considerably in my study. But I can only carry out such a project as I see it, making whatever case I can for these decisions. In the end, however, such judgments fall where they may.

analysis of contemporary society must expose these twin formalisms as dis- guising the operations of concrete if self-deluded interests. Do postmodern discourses attain to such radicalism? One can here isolate three tendencies associated with the names of Emman- uel Levinas (and to a large extent Jacques Derrida), Gilles Deleuze, and Alain Badiou respectively. First of all, a Levinasian perspective tends to bring together the perspec- tive of rights with the perspective of civility. A Kantian formalism regarding the generalized other is supposedly exceeded at the point where a legal ac- knowledgment of freedom passes over into the non-legislatable style of re- garding the other’s speciﬁcity.This is a matterof cultivating a manner, rather than simply following a rule. And apparently this is a liturgical idiom, be- cause respect for the other is described by Levinas in terms of the worshipful acknowledgment of the absolute Other, in his irreducible absence.58

OTHER-CENTERED ETHICS Response ethics starts with the post-phenomenological work of Emmanuel Levinas, who claims ethics is first philosophy. Before philosophy can inves- tigate metaphysics (what is real) or epistemology (what or how we know), Levinas insists we must begin with ethical relationships. Our primary rela- tionship to the world is not one of knowing or grasping, but rather an ethical relationship. What we take to be real and what we know are both the results of our relations with others. Unlike traditional ethical theories, Levinas takes the other, rather than the self, as a starting point. He goes so far as saying that the subject is “hostage” to the other, suggesting that our sense of ourselves as agents or egos exist only by virtue of our relation to others. Levinas proposes a non-egological ethical philosophy where the normative foundation of obli- gations does not come fr…

virtues we admire can be found in other ways of life, and that the evils we deplore can be found in ours as well as those of others. Coexploration can lead to mutual transformation. I think the ethic of care has something in common with the ethics of alterity (otherness) described by Jacques Derrida and Emmanuel Levinas. 36 Both call for respect of the other as other. Richard Bernstein says this of Derrida: Few writers have written with such nuanced understanding about the suffering, mourning "other." In one of his most beautiful and loving essays, his homage to Levinas (from whom he appropriates so much), Derrida writes of . . . "the respect for the other as what it is: other. Without this acknowledgement, which is not a knowledge, or let us say without this 'letting be' of an existent (Other) as something existing outside me in the essence of what is (first in its alterity), no ethics would be possible." 37

By late 2004 I had begun working on this book although, as so often happens, the project as then conceived differed consider- ably from what it has become. Not yet actually writing chapters, I did have in mind a title, “The Ethics of Close Reading.” As back- ground to such a project, I was reading my way through the field of “ethical criticism,” a reading list that drew my attention in par- ticular to the work of Emmanuel Lévinas. When differences asked me to write about Derrida’s work and my work, I decided to write about the only book by Derrida sitting on my desk at the time, his Adieu à Emmanuel Lévinas. This 1997 volume is made up of two texts: “Adieu,” a short piece Derrida del…

states, charitable organisations, and overseas aid all provide a faint glimmer of the Levinasian requirement that we prioritise the needs of the other. While these are too often inadequate, while they may be motivated in part by a concern to secure us against destitution in our own unpre- dictable futures, and may require some sort of reciprocity such as grati- tude or attempt by the needy to attain self-sufﬁciency, they nevertheless rest on an element of responsibility for the other. Moreover, it is not just Levinas: Love, Justice and Responsibility 61
