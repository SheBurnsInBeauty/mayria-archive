15 Benjamin and the Loss of Aura The B-effect (or at least, concepts contributing to the B-effect) may be traced to the very dawn of the postmodern era, in Walter Benjamin’s celebrated essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1936). Here, Benjamin misleadingly meditates upon the “decay” (225), the “shriveling” (233), and the “destruction” (240) of what he calls the “aura of art.” Proposing that this aura, or the sense of a work’s uniqueness, is “inseparable from its being imbedded in the fabric of tradition” (225), Benjamin suggests that “the technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition” so that “that which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art” (223). At best, Benjamin offers a half-truth. Considered from the perspective of such early advocates of the C- effect as the futurist artist Carlo Carrà, those experimenting with

Walter Benjamin (1892–1940) Walter Benjamin was closely associated with the Frankfurt School but he was very much a maverick thinker. His early writing was on Goethe and German Baroque drama. His best known essay is undoubtedly The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, in which he argued that modern means of reproducing works of art, especially photography and ﬁlm, have changed the special status of a work of art.This is also true, of course, of the reproduction of musical performances. Benjamin argues that works of art once used to have the quality of unique- ness which he calls their ‘aura’. Even in the case of litera- ture which, of course, had long been available in multiple copies, this aura had been maintained. Many kinds of modern works of art are actually designed with a view to reproducing them, as is the case with art prints, for example. In the case of the cinema …

322 20 THE WORK OF ART IN THE AGE OF MECHANICAL REPRODUCTION Walter Benjamin Our ﬁne arts were developed, their types and uses were established, in times very diﬀerent from the present, by men whose power of action upon things was insigniﬁcant in comparison with ours. But the amazing growth of our tech- niques, the adaptability and precision they have attained, the ideas and habits they are creating, make it a certainty that profound changes are impending in the ancient craft of the Beautiful. In all the arts there is a physical component which can no longer be considered or treated as it used to be, which cannot remain unaﬀected by our modern knowledge and power. For the last twenty years neither matter nor space nor time has been what it was from time immemorial. We must expect great innovations to transform the entire tech- nique of the arts, thereby aﬀecting artistic invention itself…

assume agency, adding more narrative. In his 1936 essay “the Work of art in the age of Its technological repro- ducibility” Walter Benjamin elaborates on the loss of what he terms the “aura” of a work of art once it becomes technologically reproducible. What is at stake in a technological reproduction, according to Benjamin, is the authen- ticity of the original which is no longer present in its imitation, as he states: “In even the most perfect reproduction, one thing is lacking: the here and now of the work of art—its unique existence in a particular place. It is this unique existence—and nothing else—that bears the mark of the history to which the work has been subject” (103). While the attendees of the “Super- natural” convention are not technological, identical reproductions of Sam and Dean, they do, in a similar manner as outlined with regard to the tech- nologically reproduced wor…

and multiple contexts rather than equating it with one unique, authentic arti- fact situated in a single context. The work, Benjamin argues, loses the “aura” of sacredness that originally lent itself to religious and exhibition functions, and it is increasingly drawn into a wide range of everyday, political, and social uses. Second, as the functions of these works change, bringing them into greater proximity with a wider range of social activities, so too the mode by which they are perceived and valued by the audience changes. Benjamin argues that rather than sacred awe or absorbed aesthetic contemplation, technically reproducible works – especially those, like film, for which the technology is an intrinsic part of the medium – are perceived in a “mode of distraction,” as backgrounds or elements of other collectively performed activities. Third, this transformation of the function of art into a collective practice of percep-

According to Hansen, by the time of his highly influential 1936 essay called “The Work of Art in the Age of Its Mechanical Reproduction,” Benjamin had largely dropped the occult and demonic associations of the term and come to speak of it as irremediably in decay. Aura was not to be understood as an eternal value bearing the unchanging meaning of an object but rather as the manner in which it can mean something for a contemporary public, inseparable from the historically changing ways of its reception. 16. For a discussion of Benjamin’s notion of the aura in relation to Marx’s notion of commodity fetishism, see Gyorgy Markus, “Walter Benjamin or The Commodity as Phantas- magoria,” New German Criti…

the artist’s early work. Unlike art historical studies, which associate per­ for­mances such as Unicorn (1970) or Mit beiden Händen gleichzeitig die Wände berühren (Scratching Both Walls at Once, 1974–75) with body art and video art,17 I would like to direct our attention ­toward their connection with sci­ entific contexts. The resonance between Rebecca Horn’s early imagescapes and the iconography of the medical clinic has often been pointed out.18 This chapter supplements such indications with references to experimen­ tal physiology and psy­chol­ogy as well as psychiatry. Like a laboratory scientist, Rebecca Horn calls the objects used in her early works “instruments,” and like one of the experimental physiologists par excellence, Claude Bernard, she deploys her instruments to instruct her­ self and ­others about life. At the same time, she designates the sphere at which the rele…

18 INTRODUCTION 19 New technologies are seldom new. Photo-sculpture emerged in Paris in 1851 and electroforming played an important role in the formation of the Victoria and Albert mu- seum after the Great Exhibition of 1851. 3D recording and 3D output methods do not feature in Benjamin’s idea of mechanical reproduction where a photograph is an image that subjectively records the material world and in turn is imperfectly reproduced by different printing systems available at low cost and in high volume. He focused on the impact that this was having on shaping public opinion. The media was pushing the aes- thetics of Fascism and the propaganda of Communism. Benjamin’s essay was written in German in 1935 and published in French in 1936 when many could see the world was only heading one way. The manipulation of printed media was playing an important role and seeding conﬂict. Benjamin’s understanding of technology predicts the fake news,

element of the work itself, complementary to a constellatory tendency. For it is not by any means simple scatter that we find here; the historical objects of Benjamin's collection, with their store of'secret affinities' (R2,3), are sprung together, so to speak, in thematic arcs, and tend to communicate with one another, intermittently, through a multitude of channels. They tell a story, for one thing, a story about the life and death of an architectural form, about the entrance of the artist into the marketplace and into the cycles of class warfare, about the technological and administrative transformation of the modern city, about the dream life of an epoch as manifest in its cultural products, most generally about the interpenetration of past and present in the field of the 'dialectical image'. This spatiotemporal interpenetration - by virtue of which the present, as dreamt once by the…

Editors' Preface Conceived, written, and first published-but not very widely dis- cussed-during the mid- to late-r930S, Walter Benjamin's essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" has become a central point of reference in cultural studies ever since Benjamin began to receive broad international attention some thirty years later. For plausible reasons, the Artwork essay has been understood-and has been used-as both condensation and emblem of what Benjamin's ad- mirers find most typical of his intellectual style: a familiarity with, and active interest in, the cultural phenomena of his own time; an awe- inspiring depth of historical knowledge; a fascination with "facts" in all of their factual bluntness; a passion for the joy of speculation re- mindful of the great protagonists of German Idealism; a commitment to political causes of the Left that does not narr…

however we generally imagine that there is something in the Object just like our Perception” (An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue, 27). 59. This is not altogether different from Walter Benjamin’s notion of the “aura” in an authentic work of art, but the point here is a more general one regarding perception and appearance tout court, and the relation of the appearance to reality implied by beauty rather than the genesis of the particular work. Nevertheless, Benjamin’s concerns about the effect on art of the technologies of mechanical reproduction certainly have a bearing on what we are describing as an impoverishment of the notion of beauty. See Benjamin, The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction. 60. See Spaemann, “What Does It Mean to Say that ‘Art Imitates Nature’?” esp. 208. 61.

that he compares to forever-lost originals such as Leonardo’s Last Supper and the portal of St Mark’s Basilica, as painted by Gentile Bellini.17 Proust’s attentiveness to details detached from their architectural body by means of zooming anticipated Walter Benjamin’s promotion of the advantages of mechanical technol- ogies in the experience of art. Photography ‘can bring out aspects of the original that are accessible only to the lens (which is adjustable and can easily change viewpoint) but not to the human eye’. Further, it can ‘use certain processes, such as enlargement or slow motion, to record images which escape natural optics altogether’.18 As such, Benjamin’s discussion of the decay of aura as a result of mechanical reproduction was not primarily a melancholic musing on decay and loss, but a hint at the aura’s possible manifestations in new media. When deﬁning an original, he underscored that its physical alterations over time ‘can be

At the same time, the liquidationist gesture disa­ vows a crucial impulse of his own thinking—​his lifelong concern with the fate of experience in the age of its declining transmissibility, a concern in which the concept of the aura plays a central if precarious part. 103 45 Walter Benjamin, ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility’, Third Version, 269. 46 Walter Benjamin, ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility’, Third Version, 282, n. 47. 47 Walter Benjamin, ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility’, Third Version, 269. 48 Walter Benjamin, ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility’, Third Version, 269. 49 Walter Benjamin, ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility’, Third Version, 270. 50 Walter Benjamin, ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility’, Third Version, 270. 51

reproduction. In the digital age, the previous distinction between origi- nal and reproduction is no longer relevant. When Walter Benjamin val- orised the erosion of the aura of art and celebrated the increased access that mechanical reproduction can create, digital advances were far in the future, meaning that the essence of the original was still present: Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is missing in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be. This unique existence of the work of art determined the history to which it was subject throughout the time of its existence. This includes the changes which it may have suffered in physical condition over the years as well as the various changes in its ownerships. (2004: 1235) The uncanny nature of digital encryption is exacerbated by its ability to produce identical copies. Judith Roof highlights the effect of this,

factor has influenced the emergence of the new avantgarde art as much as technology, which not only fueled the artists’ imagination (dynamism, machine cult, beauty of technics, constructivist and productivist attitudes), but penetrated to the core of the work itself. The invasion of the very fabric of the art object by technology and what one may loosely call the technological imagination can best be grasped in artistic practices such as collage, assemblage, montage and photomontage; it finds its ultimate fulfillment in photography and film, art forms which can not only be reproduced, but are in fact designed for mechanical reproducibility. It was Walter Benjamin who, in his famous essay “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” first made the point that it is precisely this mechanical reproducibility which has radically changed the nature of art in the 20th centu…

Cambridge Companions Online © Cambridge University Press, 2006 Walter Benjamin and the European avant-garde focuses: industrial art; architecture; photography; mass culture; and, above all, the emergence of startlingly new cultural forms in France and Russia.4 And it is not merely the discovery of a new cultural sphere that emanates from Benjamin’s participation in the group. From it he will derive a new conception of the work of art and its place in the culture. Both Benjamin’s technological utopianism, evident in later essays such as “Little History of Photography,” “The Author as Producer,” and especially “The Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility,” and his analysis of the de- mystiﬁcation of the artwork – the destruction of its “aura” – must be traced to the discussions in the G-Group. The “Copernican turn” in Benjamin’s thinking in 1924 is grounded, then, not j…

7 This is the claim made by Walter Benjamin in his well-​ known essay “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” in Illuminations, ed. Hannah Arendt (New York: Schocken, 1969). 8 For more on this, see John Berger, Ways of Seeing (New York: Penguin, 1972), especially the first chapter, which draws its inspiration from the Benjamin essay cited above.

He is also the first to show how the philosophical problems it presents are projections of social anxieties regarding taste. Everyone knows Benjamin’s essay. Its lament is contagious: Mechanical art, especially the photograph and the film image, removes from art the “aura” (1936, 222) that customarily surrounds it. Although “in principle a work of art has always been reproducible” (218) – the woodcut, the painting, and the lithograph are Benjamin’s sequential historical examples – photography and film complete this process, which results in a qualita- tive transformation in the nature of the art object: the “decay,” as Benjamin puts it, “of the aura” (222). The “aura” Benjamin defines as “the unique phenomenon of a distance, however close it may be, whether a mountain range on the horizon or a branch which casts its shadow over you” (222–3). Painting preserves the aura because…

itself and the institutions to which it is connected. Unlike in Bürger, in Benjamin the way in which the audience perceives works of art has socially and politically transformative potential in and of itself. In “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” Benjamin explains that photography, lithography, and film destroy the uniqueness and authenticity inherent in the notion of tradition—especially tradition in art—through their nearly unlimited capacity for reproduction (1968b: 218-20). He argues that mechanical reproducibility brings about the demise of art’s aura by detaching the object “from the domain of tradition” (1968b: 221). Mechanical reproduction rivals the creativity of humankind and dispels the magical aura that originality, as well as the sacred and ritual quality surrounding the creative act (at times associated with divine inspiration), would ascribe to all artistic endeavor. Because the

tem, concealing the work of the apparatus, and thus reducing the distance perceived between the object and its representation. The maneuvers of the sound recording industry offer evidence which support Walter Benjamin’s thesis linking mechani- cal reproduction as a phenomenon with contemporary society’s destruction of the “aura” (which he defines as “the unique phenomenon of a distance, however close it may be”).7 According to Benjamin, [the] contemporary decay of the aura . . . rests on two circumstances, both of which are related to the increasing significance of the masses in contemporary life. Namely, the desire of contemporary masses to bring things “closer” spatially and humanly, which is just as ardent as their bent toward overcoming the uniqueness of every reality by accepting its reproduction.8 Nevertheless, while the desire to bring things closer is certainly exploited in makin…

is exactly what Benjamin counters in his essay on “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.” Going against the anti-techno- logical trend that permeated the entire culture of the time, what he identifies in the unlimited repeatability of the work of art is something that profoundly transforms the aesthetic perception. The destruction of the “aura” frees the object from the Romantic sheath that envelopes it, infi- nitely prolonging its life. Whatever is endlessly

consider how Benjamin historicizes this model in relation to pre-capitalist and modern industrial societies. In particular I shall emphasize and develop that relation, between mechanical reproduction and the decay of ‘aura’, which Benjamin sees as central to Modernism. In section III, drawing on more insights from Benjamin and also from Baudrillard (and, to a lesser extent, Lyotard), I shall outline the way in which techniques of mechanical reproduction arising in the modern epoch prove ultimately decisive for postmodern experience. I will further suggest that the decay of aura is compensated for by the development of a sensibility orientated towards shocks. In conclusion, I will brieﬂy relate this to the project of Critical Aesthetics, and the strategy of this book as a whole. I For Benjamin, consciousness is a direct awareness of sensory stimuli. Its function is to prevent the self fro…

in the project that consumed the last part of his career and which remained incomplete at the time of his death in 1940. The direct link between this project and the style of presentation Benjamin described in the introduc- tion to The Origin of the German Tragic Drama is expressed by Benjamin in this last project in the following words: “The book on the baroque ex- posed the seventeenth century to the light of the present day. Here, something analogous must be done for the nineteenth century, but with greater distinct- ness” (Arcades, 459; n1a, 2). A greater distinctness is made apparent by the fragmentary state of this work. More than any of Benjamin’s other works, the Arcades Project poses the question of how to read Benjamin. Indeed, what does one do when faced with a mass of quotations interspersed with a commentary presented in a fragmentary form identical to the quotations that ma…

If truth itself is not clear, as with the examples of homonyms and homophones, or Derrida’s undecidables such as the Pharmakon, then the transmission of facts becomes problematic. Walter Benjamin’s notion of “aura” represents the awe-inspiring singularity encountered traditional art. So is mechanical reproduction without singularity and therefore artless? This doesn’t appear to be true, considering the body of digitally derived works which are now internationally acclaimed as new media art. But digital technology does take mechanical reproduction to an effortless extreme, further hiding the singularity of art, despite the fact that this singularity is what delineates the individual human existence. For a computer to make art, it must incorporate the singularity of the human

precisely this mechanical reproducibility which has radically changed the nature of art in the 20th century, transforming the conditions of producing, distributing, and receiving/consuming art. In the context of social and cultural theory Benjamin conceptualized what Marcel Duchamp had already shown in 1919 in L.H.O.O.Q. By iconoclastically altering a reproduction of the Mona Lisa and, to use another example, by exhibiting a mass-produced urinal as a fountain sculpture, Marcel Duchamp succeeded in destroying what Benjamin called the traditional art work’s aura, that aura of authenticity and uniqueness that constituted the work’s distance from life and that required contemplation and immersion on the part of the spectator. In another essay, Benjamin himself acknowledged that the intention to destroy this aura was already inherent in the artistic practices of Dada.13 The destructi…

lation of commodities). Actually for Benjamin the storyteller was already a figure who, while not quite ghostly, was already receding into the distance. Indeed, it was the advent of modernization itself that brought about our sensitivity to the aura. Modern shock and fragmentation constituted the aura as a problem precisely through making us realize that it is what the present lacks. At the center of Benjamin’s readings of such key modernist authors as Baudelaire, Kafka, Proust, and Brecht (of whom he was a personal friend) is the notion of modern experience being conditioned by the decay of the aura. Authentic aura, represented by the masterpieces of the past constituting high culture, was threatened by modern techniques of mechanical reproduction, which could reproduce the art object in multiple copies, making it a commodity like any other in mass culture. But, Benjamin also reasoned, there might be revolutionary potential waiting to be unlocked in new forms of communica-

book, Mechanization Takes Command (1948), is a landmark work in the history of technology, and his methodological claim in this study to be writing the “anonymous history” of the twentieth century bears close comparison to Benjamin’s focus on the anonymous, collective dissemination of the arcade as a nineteenth-century architectural and cultural space.40 Other focal points of Benjamin’s investigations of architecture include: the creation of city “per- spectives” in the Haussmannisation of Paris; the architectural reorganization of social time implicit in the glass and iron constructions of the Universal Exhibitions; and the reconstellation of interior and exterior space, of city and dwelling place, effected by the new building materials and architectural forms. Architecture as an instance of art and of everyday culture necessarily entails both collective production and collective reception. It has an explicit relation

In part this will allow us to understand the decisions and materials that make the original, the way it has aged and decayed and the things that have happened to it over its lifetime. All things are in a constant dynamic process of change. Replicas not only help us understand and empathise, they can also encourage us to become aware of our tem- poral and perspectival limitations. Digitality and auras have much in common; they are far from being discrete, stable and clearly deﬁned. Digitality was once associated with the virtual but is becoming increasingly physical. Digital data is dependent on electricity and human input. For Benjamin the aura is intrinsic to, and emanating from, the object; in reality the aura is Age of Mechanical Reproduction over his shoulder stating that in a digital age we need to rethink the relationship between originality and authenticity.

volves an erosion of the original material out of which a golden glow emerges, parallels Benjamin’s understanding of aura as irrevocably tied to withering, even shriveling. For Benjamin, aura is linked to uniqueness and history; reproductions substitute what he views favorably (because they are nonelitist) as “a plurality of copies for a unique existence.” Mechanical reproduction “withers” “the aura of the work of art,” which is linked “to the history which it has experi- enced” (Benjamin, Illuminations 221). What Benjamin leaves out of his argument is the possibility that a mechanically produced object such as a toy (a material corollary to a mechanically reproduced image), through the acquisition of “history” by handling (Tzara’s patina), might be reinvested with “aura” because the desire it awakens reactivates a ritualistic function. The reactivated “cult value” then confo…

consumed much of the time through ubiquitous advertising.

Silverman It is Benjamin’s achievement to have defined, by the concept of the aura, the type of relation between work and recipient that evolves in the institution of art in bourgeois society. Two essential insights come together here: first, that it is not in and of themselves that works of art have their effect but rather that this effect is decisively determined by the institution within which the works function; second, that modes of reception must be based in social history: the perception of aura, for example, in the bourgeois individual. (1984: 30-31) Bürger credits Benjamin with explaining how the relationship between art and audience develops over time, referring specifically to Benjamin’s conceptualization of the aura in “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1936) and “On Some Motifs in Baudelaire” (1939). In contrast to Benjamin, Bürger insists that art’s

in terms that echo Ruskin’s notion of every day and indeed every moment as a day of judgment, in particular for the Jews, prohibited from investigating the future, but for whom nevertheless ‘every second of time was the straight gate through which the Messiah might enter’(266). In a sense Benjamin is a mirror image of Ruskin. Against Ruskin’s attempts to save art for God Benjamin proclaims the end of the aura of the work of art, an end bound up with technical reproducibility. It is perhaps simply that Benjamin celebrates what Ruskin has intuited, that mechanical reproduction techniques have a close relationship with the Death of God, and the triumph of nihilism, not least because they engage with contingency and time (Ruskin, though some twenty-five years older than Nietzsche, died in the same year, 1900. Both also had succumbed to mental illness almost completely by 1889). At the same time Ruskin also perhaps intuited something else; that the Death

Benjamin as early as 1939, when he revised his notion of “aura” by heuris- tically conflating Proust’s mémoire involontaire with Freud’s theory of trauma from the 1920 Beyond the Pleasure Principle. In his 1936 essay, “The Artwork in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility,” Benjamin describes aura as an effect of the authority of singular works of bourgeois art. The translation, as it were, of the authority of older sacral art into the categories of bourgeois art (autonomy, organic wholeness, genius, originality, authenticity), aura produces the feeling of an “irreducible distance” between the spectator and the work.6 In reworking this metaphor in the 1939 “On Some Motifs in Baudelaire,” Benjamin significantly shifts the ground introduction / 5

Best known for a text called ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction’ where the world of mass produced art- works, in particular those of photography and ﬁlm, are explored, Benjamin is also regarded as an iconic intellectual of the twentieth century, who blurred the boundaries of many traditionally isolated subject areas, from the impact of modernity to the meaning of Mickey Mouse. Benjamin was born on 15 July 1892 in Berlin; he was edu- cated at Kaiser Friedrich Schule in Berlin, and at the Landerzie- hungsheim Haubinda in Thuringia where, signiﬁcantly, he came into contact with the charismatic school reformer Gustav Wyneken, an important ﬁgure in Benjamin’s youth. The German youth movements – via Wyneken’s mediation – inspired Benjamin, and he became a member of the radical ‘group for school reform’ at Albert Ludwig WALTER BENJAMIN 1111 2 3 4 5111 6 7 8 9 10111 11 2 3111 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 21111 25

concentrating on various aspects of Benjamin's philosophy of art, brilliantly setting Benjamin's ideas against the similar yet perhaps less profound ideas of Marcuse and Adorno. Here we meet such notions as 'aura,' 'secular illumination,' and 'dialectical images.' Not the least virtue of Habermas's rendition is the way he registers Benjamin's own ambivalence toward the phenomenon of aura, according as it is ritualized or deritualized. One constant feature of Benjamin's thought is the experience correlative to what in the "Theses on the Philosophy of History" he calls the Jetztzeit [now time]: an experience of time that breaks up the continuity of homogeneous time or of time as a raceway of instants. Habermas points out the centrality of Benjamin's theory of experience as unspoiled and unmutilated"of people living close to nature, madmen, seers, and artists" and of his project of a

78 Walter Benjamin on Radio introduced new architectural forms such as the ‘‘ﬁrst exhibition palaces . . . the ﬁrst covered markets, and above all the ﬁrst train stations’’ (564). Op- posing such ‘‘ﬁrsts’’ and their moment of emergence to the contemporary understanding of technology, Benjamin appears to build a narrative of re- ception history that would begin in nonknowledge and proceed, with a conspicuously naive hopefulness (not even in his most explicit messianism is Benjamin so insistent on a progressive history), to arrive with conﬁdence in a present that has mastered technology as object of knowledge: ‘‘When people ﬁrst attempted to smelt iron and build steam engines at the begin- ning of the nineteenth century, that was a very different matter from what happens today when scientists and engineers go about developing a new airplane or even a space rocket or some other new machine.…

subjected to “dryness and moisture, heat and cold, outer wear and inner disintegration” (264). 17 However—“for the last time the aura emanates from the early photographs” (“Work of Art” 224). Benjamin explains this “persistence” of aura a.o. with the long exposure times of early photography. In the reduction of exposure time—which more than faintly reminds of Bergson’s duration—from various hours to only seconds, Benjamin sees an important factor of the decay of aura. Correspondingly, long exposure time emerges as a sign of the “technical conditionality of the auratic appearance” (“Small History” 248, my translation of “technisches Bedingtsein der auratischen Erscheinung”), that “strange weave of space and time” (250). 18 My translation of “so entspricht die Aura ... eben der Erfahrung, die sich an einem Gegenstand des Gebrauchs als Ubung absetzt.,” in: Walter Benjamin (2002), “tlber einige Motive bei Baudelaire” Mediendsthetische

more of its commodities. Such nihilization of mechanical reproduction can also be carried out à la Marx: as a process of the real subsumption of all auratic value within the matrix of mass seriality, establishing thus a parallel between the becoming of the Jenny or complex machine-tool and the becoming of the photographic-cinematographic machine whose deployment would subsume any other mode of production, leveling it. Benjamin shielded himself from the nihil that is contained within the totali- tarian matrix of mechanical reproduction as a mode of production that tends, as a reﬂ ection of its power, toward total mobilization. He did so by embracing mechanical reproduction’s totalitarian serial matrix, not as a planetary metatech- nology of the epochal consummation of the ages of Western history but rather as a singular mode of production that coexists and clashes with other modes of production and temporalities within a polychronic milieu.

After the Nazi seizure of power in Germany in 1933, Benjamin went into exile in Paris, while Adorno was attached to Oxford, returning periodically to Germany, where his institutional record was relatively unmarked.

onto the cosmos.”152 16. Schwellen: Walter Benjamin too was fascinated by this undulating, plunging, dissolving, wave-like movement.153 His remarkable concept of “a turn of recollection” (eine Wendung des Eingedenkens) is precisely that through which time as such swells. Time itself becoming “more and less than what it appears,” a “distended res intensa.”154 My interest in Benjamin’s work emanates from his theory of collecting (to re-collect, recollection), which is an aspect of his thinking the “past in the present” as a “space of history” (Geschichtsraum). His “milieu theoretician,” the “genuine collector” (echter Sammler), is bound with this philosophy of history. In place of the nineteenth-century caricature of the collector as a sort of fetishistic antiquarian or as an inveterate souvenir hunter, Benjamin reconciles two seemingly opposite figures—the bourgeois collector and the destructive character—into a “genuine

BENJAMIN, WALTER contemplation of traditional works of art leads to one's absorption by the art work, the shock effect of cinema, grounded in the continual change of images, allows one to absorb the work, albeit in a state of distraction. As with architecture, the audience's response is at once tactile and absent-minded. Benjamin thus proposes the formation of a politically active and critical audience through the disruption and shock of a montage of cinematic images. The Arcades Project is Benjamin's impressionistic and fragmentary study of nineteenth-century Paris (Benjamin 1973a, 1999c). Benjamin is concerned with ephemeral nature of modernism, and particularly with the modern city. The Parisian arcades transform experience of space and social relationships. Again, while more accessible in its writ- ten style than the early study of baroque drama, it is perhaps again best …

Benjamin’s statement is fol­ lowed by the equally famous paragraph: While at rest on a summer’s noon, to trace a range of mountains on the hori­ zon, or a branch that throws its shadow on the observer, until the moment or the hour become part of their appearance—​this is what it means to breathe the aura of those mountains, that branch.

walter benjamin 57 Benjamin gives special attention to the science-fiction writer and modern- ist fantast Paul Scheerbart, who, along with the expressionist architect Bruno Taut, formulated a utopian program for the transformation of the planet through glass architecture. Just as Taut, in his anarcho-utopian treatise Die Auflösung der Städte (The Dissolution of the Cities) called for a resettlement of the earth on a new basis,14 so too Scheerbart, in his 1914 treatise Glass Architecture – which also featured in Benjamin’s exposé for the Arcades Project – had seen building in glass as the promised end of the industrial brick city as it had been constructed up to the present. Thus, in a section of Glass Architecture captioned “The transformation of the Earth’s surface,” Scheerbart struck a prophetic note: So many ideas constantly sound to us like a fairy-tale, when they are not really fantastic or utopian at all. Eighty years ago, the steam railway

of profaning, and yet is always in flight from the trivial results of profanation. On the other hand, the time consciousness articulated in avant-garde art is not simply ahistorical; it is directed against what might be called a false normativity in history. The modem, avant-garde spirit has sought to use the past in a different way; it disposes those pasts which have been made available by the objectifying scholarship of historicism, but it opposes at the same time a neutralised history which is locked up in the museum of historicism. Drawing upon the spirit of Surrealism, Walter Benjamin constructs the relationship of modernity to history in what I would call a posthistoricist attitude. He reminds us of the self-understanding of the French Revolution: 'The Revolution cited ancient Rome, just as fashion cites an antiquated dress. Fashion has a scent for what is current, whenever this moves within the thicket of what was once.' This is Benjamin's concept

back the recorded sounds. Kittler similarly points to the analytical function of the phonograph and gramophone, which retrieve the original function of Scott’s invention, where he argues that the analysis of speech – an analysis of the material rather than the symbolic – that was afforded by the invention of recorded voice machines was instrumental to the vast changes to discourse seen around the end of the nineteenth century. These machines were able to be used for analytical purposes by slowing down the playback speed to reproduce for human ears sounds previously unable to be notated. The gramophone and phonograph, when used as a talking machine, were able to allow slow-motion studies of single sounds that were previously unavailable. This made the devices ideal in laboratories for measuring hearing. In schools, these devices were instrumental in allowing the analysis of ‘th…

confirms and disavows McGrath's analysis. For him, the `instantaneous recording process' of the photograph sets it apart from the painting; the camera's `penetrative vision' (1987: 30) gives it access to the `basic reality' of the photographer's subjects, beyond that which the painter might capture. Interestingly, however, the photograph is also offered as a protection against this reality. Confirming McGrath's view of the fetishistic quality of his photographs, Weston adds that `the beholder may find the created image more real and comprehensible than the actual object' (Weston 2003: 107). The debate about photography's relationship with art characterised the beginnings of modernity. For Walter Benjamin, famously, the photograph's reproducibility meant the destruction of the `aura' of the work of art, so that photography represents `the first truly revolutionary means of reproduction' (1999: 218). But he also identifies it with

within the existing hours. He bases this view not so much upon the quality of the reproduction which further experiments may be expected to improve as upon the present limited scope of the objects which can be reproduced. The Postmaster-General is, however, anxious that facilities should be afforded. ( Swift 1950 : 43–44) On 30 September 1929, Baird Television began its experimental broadcasts outside normal Broadcast programming. Even as the problem of delay was being solved, the problem of synchronization would prove to be a consistent issue to be grappled with by the engineers of experimental television systems. The reconstruction of an image at the receiving end of a television system is dependent on the reconstructed elements falling in exactly the right place at precisely the right time.

audiophilic detour. Widely associated with his writings on photography, Benjamin is less well known for his contributions to the early history of radio. Between 1927 to 1933, Benjamin made more than eighty broadcasts over the new medium, working at stations in Berlin and Frankfurt. Some of these performances were given in the form of Ho¨rmodelle (listening models, or radio models); some were commissioned speciﬁcally for Berlin radio’s Jugendstunde or the Stunde der Jugend on Su¨dwestdeutschen Rund- funks in Frankfurt.4 In either instance, perhaps all the more so for the latter given the directed speciﬁcity of its target audience, the issue of programming—of culture as (pre)programmed—asserts some force and sway. In the extant manuscripts of his radio addresses, including those performed for children, Benjamin can hardly be said to presume a deﬁni- tion of his addressee (‘‘children’’) or …

84 Walter Benjamin on Radio the playful appropriation of technology in Grandville’s imagery represents the ‘‘enthronement of the commodity, with its glitter of distractions.’’ The transformation of the world, including its cosmological forms of appearance, into familiar scenes of such enthronement is, Benjamin argues, the secret theme of Grandville’s art. Whence the split between its utopian and cynical elements in his work. The subtle artiﬁces with which it repre- sents inanimate objects correspond to what Marx calls the ‘‘theological ni- ceties’’ of the commodity. The concrete expression of this is clearly found in the spe´cialite´—a category of goods which appears at this time in the luxu- ries industry. World exhibitions construct a universe of specialties. The fan- tasies of Grandville achieve the same thing. They modernize the universe. In his work, the ring of Saturn becomes a cas…
