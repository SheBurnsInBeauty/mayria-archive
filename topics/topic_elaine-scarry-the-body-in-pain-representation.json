When she writes about pain, she narrows her focus to the capacity of language to repre- sent the material world—to name objects—eschewing a more complex view of language that includes its social and creative functions. Language about pain fails, in her view, because it cannot identify its object and thus it cannot confer a verifiable reality upon an internal experience. Like physicians, Scarry wants language to name and validate what is real and true. For both, this desire cre- ates the conditions for doubt and indifference. It is also the case, however, that in the second half of The Body in Pain, Scarry complicates her original assertions and describes the paths by which pain, “this most radically private of experiences,” enters cultur…",

Here, bodies are no longer assumed simply to be given in and to the world but are rather understood as both the locus of thinking – the site from which thinking takes place – and as the object of thought – as being already subject to interpretation and conceptualisation. As Elaine Scarry has shown in The Body in Pain, the interfaces between bodies and their worlds are made and unmade through social practices, the pain of which may shatter language and defy its representational potential (1985: 5). Thus the practices of thinking are not separated from the realm of the body but are implicated in the passion, emotions and materiality that are associated with lived embodiment. The task of Thinking Through the Skin is, at one level, to continue the feminist project of taking bodies seriously as both the subject and object of thinking.",

To this number must be added the vast legions for which pain is such an inescapable dimension of daily life that it excites no particular response and indeed scarcely has a name. Not feeling their pain at all, Scarry treats as an immediate and monochrome physical experience, a baseline of reality, what is in fact a combination of sensations, dispositions, cultural circumstances, and explanations, a phenomenon involving body, mind, and culture. She has, in other words, misconceived the character of pain precisely by giving it a character, by treating it as a fact—a brute fact, the first and final fact—rather than as an interpretation. So rhetorically or internally filigreed, Scarry’s thoughts on pain, as on torture and war, are, when matched against the things them- selves, strikingly undeveloped.11 To understand the “internal” significance, the placement, of pain in",

However, all contributions are united by their concen- tration on two bodies: that of the beholder and that of the victim/performer.

The representation of the wounded and painful part of the body Let us emphasize that such a connection of causes inducing corporeal pain evokes that which presides at the formation of the psychical pain. We see that the logical schemas accounting for these two forms of pain are almost identical. However, one of their differences resides in the imaginary contents of the hypertrophic representation.14 Indeed, while for corporeal pain the rep- resentation refers to a wounded body, psychical pain refers to an object that has been loved and lost (a person, a thing, or a value).

But Das’s discussion of Manto’s story suggests that acknowledgment, compassion, and love, like all acts of inter- pretation, are vulnerable to error, ignorance, and indeterminacy. And yet, she shows they are also fundamentally necessary in embodied and social life. While Das appears to have traveled far from Scarry’s The Body in Pain, her analysis of the limits and possibilities of language about pain ultimately builds in productive ways on Scarry’s critical legacy.

Therefore, one of the goals of this book is to investigate how such pain is directly ‘transmitted’ to the spectator, as a phenomenon that is simultaneously a sensation and an emotion (Jackson 1994: 201). For many philosophers of pain, the state of pain disrupts the intentionality of the body; even more keenly, pain disrupts the relationship between the lived-body and the world. In pain, one may experience one’s body as an ‘alien presence’ (Leder 1990: 73) because it appears as strange, or ‘other’, to one, becoming an object instead of a subject of experience. While in normal circumstances the body is the locus from which one directs one’s attention to the world, in pain the body becomes an objec…",

If pain is to be sought, it must be in the context of an end point, a desired outcome such as a tattoo or piercing; the pain itself is seen as a necessary horror to be endured. A wilful inversion of Scarry’s thesis in the unsurpassed The Body in Pain is instructive in elaborating on the relationship between pain and the generation of meaning. Scarry’s starting point is a concern with how physical suffering may structure the subject’s experience of the world around them and their position within it as subject or otherwise. One of her most vital claims is that physical pain carries with it the ability to ‘utterly nullify the claims of the world’ or to ‘unmake’ the world (Scarry 1985: 33).

Acute pain is open to narration by witnesses, advocates, torturers, or theorists—all of whom may separate that pain, through representation, from the suffering body itself (one of Scarry’s arguments). If the nonparticipatory anesthetized patient is in many ways more convenient for the surgeon, the in- articulate sufferer is so for the theorist” (132). Although Holmes seems to be on the verge of rejecting much of what Scarry says in The Body in Pain, she is instead inspired to reread the book. She finds things there she had overlooked, such as an acknowledgment that chronic pain is distinct from the acute pain of torture. “Perhaps the fault is not in The Body in Pain,” Holmes suggests, “but in how we have tended to read it”: “Drawn to the keen lines of acute pain and the attractions of the unmaking of the world, we have bypassed the places in the text where the world …",

As Scarry points out: ‘[W]hatever pain achieves, it achieves in part through its unsharability, and it ensures this unsharability through its resis- tance to language. . . . Physical pain [brings] about an immediate reversion to a state anterior to language, to the sounds and cries a human being makes be- fore language is learned’ (Scarry 1985: 4).9 But this does not necessarily mean that pain cannot be represented, or that one cannot understand its effects, if not the experience, when not physically in pain. In pain the body ‘speaks’ through affect, not through language. Furthermore, this does not mean that communication through affect is void of semantic meaning altogether.

The body is neither a purely natural given nor is it merely a textual metaphor.”1 Elaine Scarry is similarly attentive to what she calls “the socialization of sentience” (BP 255). Locating the body’s capacities and needs at the origin of material culture, Scarry contends that human sentience is inevitably restructured by the very objects it produces. In other words, those objectifications of the body that comprise the made world—from the minutest physical or verbal artifact to that vast collec- tive artifact called “civilization”—return as percepts and concepts to their source in the body, where they reside as the fundamental constituents of…",

In the experience of pain there is often the immediate feeling that something external is directed against one, even though this something is located within oneself. It is identified as ‘not oneself’, as something so alien that it must immediately be disposed of. Simultaneously that same something is internalized in such a way that the person in pain may be dominated by a sense of ‘internal agency’. Thus when a knife enters the body, for instance, one will feel one’s own body, rather than the knife, hurting one (Scarry 1985: 52–53). In the film Black Swan, both ‘modalities of pain’ – external and internal – seem to be operating simultaneously. In this film, protagonist Nina mutilates herself in order to replace her feelings of insecurity with a sense of external control. Rather than being …",

Elaine Scarry’s now canonical study The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World established that this new ordering of the material world occurs for the victim during the scene of torture. According to Scarry, before this scene, objects already play a crucial role in the formation of the subject. In the case of the tortured person, such objects are not only changed, but actually participate in the prisoner’s resis- tance, in the reconstitution of a reduced subjectivity, producing Scarry’s re- ordering of the subject’s relationship to the material world, but also giving the object a memorial charge that retains the residual presence of the disap- peared subject.13 This dangerous potentiality posed by the object is palpable in the way in which such everyday items were policed and pillaged during the dictatorship.",

Levinas’s thinking may be contrasted to that found in Elaine Scarry’s influ- ential 1980s book, The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985), which is also relevant for the present study. Levinas’s thinking of the suffering of the other does not entail simply a reversal of the analysis found in The Body in Pain (influenced, as the latter is, more by the analytic tradition rather than the continental). This is in the sense that it does not operate in terms of, and therefore merely subvert, the same conceptual field. Nevertheless, there is a striking contrast between the two. For Scarry, while the pain of the other is always susceptible to doubt, denial or disregard, one’s own pain is undeni- ably certain. For Levinas, on the contrary, while one’s own pain can never be fully available as such, experienced without remainder by the conscious-",

To conceive of one signifying framework that could account for the numerous sensations and attendant contextual elements (instruments used, accompanying music or locations, clothing to reveal or hide the wounds, and so on) is to remain bound to a repressive and institutionalized schema that seeks to co-opt and control any body that refuses to adhere to the standardized codes of the human. The multiplicity of meanings that surround self-harm, in the social sphere and the realm of personal experience, may be evoked through the scene in The Piano Teacher in which Erika, sitting on the side of the bath, cuts her genitals in a gesture that is presented as a habitual act of mutilation. Furthermore, this scene enacts a dovetailing of self-mutilation and masochism in its emphasis upon a key point of interconnection betwee…",

It is also a reminder that suffering does not valorise pain but repeats the circumstances in which the suffering originated. Whilst Jewel believes that the tattoo on his back is impressive, Mariarme is only reminded of the pain which it must have caused. For her, there is no question of the tattoo's beauty transcending Jewel's suffering even though pain is eroticised. Asking Jewel why he allowed Donally to 'attack him' with the needles (p. 86), she wants to know how much it hurt him (p. 96).

Who are the authors of this attempted reversal, the creators or near-creators of a language for pain? Because the words of five different groups of women and men have been regularly consulted in the preliminary thinking for this book, it will be helpful to name them here, though they together constitute only a very partial list of all those who have entered into the long history of this struggle.

Henceforth, each time that a sharp screaming strikes the ears of the subject, whether a scream proffered by the other, or a new scream from the subject itself, the pain reappears as a memory in the flesh. By hearing the scream, the subject feels an inexplicable physical pain. The scream is thus not only a figure of pain, it can also be, because it is a memory, an excitation that leads to a painful sensation without an identifiable organic cause. It is as if the sensation was a hallucinated pain. The sequence of our reasoning would be as follows: the scream reflects pain, the scream refracts pain, and then the scream triggers pain. It shows it, marks it, and engenders it as a hal- lucinated production. To read these pages of Freud in light of what Lacan has taught us, we rec- ognize clearly two important articulations.

There is in imagining no activity, no “state,” no experienceable condition or felt-occurrence separate from the objects: the only evidence that one is “imagining” is that imaginary objects appear in the mind. Thus, while pain is like seeing or desiring but not like seeing x or desiring y, the opposite but equally extraordinary characteristic belongs to imagining. (162) For Scarry, pain and imagination are finally “the ‘framing events’ within whose boundaries all other perceptual, somatic, and emotional events occur; thus, between the two extremes can be mapped the whole terrain of the human psyche” (165).

Realizing how powerfully and precisely our mental life is displayed through bodily expression, they have shown how the most subtle nuances of belief, desire, and feeling are reﬂected in the postural and gestural attitudes of our ﬁgures and facial countenance. However, in their idolizing love of the human body, artists have usually preferred to portray it as the attractive object of another person’s con- sciousness rather than the radiating expression of the somatic subject’s own probing consciousness of embodied self. Women, particularly young vulnerable women, are the frequent subjects of such objectiﬁcation, por- trayed as lusciously sensuous and obligingly passive ﬂesh for the viewer’s devouring delectation. The artistic yearning to glorify the body’s beauty as desired object often results, moreover, in stylistic exaggerations that",

Pain therefore needs to be apprehended before it can be corporeally shared; it needs to be given an external image before it can be invested in bodily terms. Once the image of the harmed body is visualised, viewers can apprehend the degree of damage inflicted and calculate its probable effect. If this is a successfully disturbing experience, viewers may recoil at the encounter with their own fragility and capacity for somatic empathy. It is when pain can be objectified and external- ised through Horror that the damaged body is turned into an available expe- rience to be felt alongside fictional characters. This is why pain can be seen, paradoxically, as an empirical catalyst, because it puts viewers back in contact with the body as object. Horror makes …",

Though phantom pain usually resembles pre-­amputation pain, Flor explains that her theory remains inconclusive, partially due to the influence of the psychical upon the physical. She concludes that “more longitudinal research is needed to test the pain memory hypothesis” (Flor 2006, 878).

The central topos that emerges in this corpus of texts is that of a wound cutting deeply into both body and mind, cutting across both spheres and through the boundaries between the two. The narra- tor of Shelley’s short story “The Mourner” – which, similar to her novella Mathil- da, explores death and pathological mourning within a complex father-daughter re- lationship – paradigmatically describes the trauma victim’s suffering as “so great as to confuse the boundary between physical and mental sensation” (89). Conceptualizations of the interrelations between the physical and the psycho- logical have further implications in the context of mental illness.

I want to suggest here, cautiously, and tentatively, that an ethics of responding to pain involves being open to being affected by that which one cannot know or feel. Such an ethics is, in this sense, bound up with the sociality or the ‘contingent attach- ment’ of pain itself. Much of the thinking on pain, however, contrasts the ungraspability of the other’s pain with the graspability of my own pain. Elaine Scarry makes this contrast in her analysis of pain and torture (1985: 4). Certainly, there is something ungraspable about the other’s pain, and this is not just because I do n…",

The corporeal mapping of race and sex is never simple, and feminists need to ask more complex questions about the inter­ relationship of those categories and the body. It is no surprise, then, that the devaluation of women through their putative identification with bodily matters is mirrored by a similarly grounded devalua­ tion of slaves, of children, of animals, and of black people. Work in both philosophy and science studies, as the pieces by Elizabeth Spelman and Lynda Birke show, outlines a move to reduce marginalised others to their bodies. The process of categorisation that works to set in place boundaries between the normal and the abnormal, between the fully human and the sub-human, is as pertinent to the classical institution of slavery as it is to more recent biological reductionism that ties women to their reproductive functions.

She skilfully and convincingly uses her deep understanding of metapsychology and her mastery of Freud’s seminal papers to demonstrate that thought is one of the manifestations of desire, which, by definition, implies a painful renun- ciation of the object of desire. She explains the trajectory involved in the transformation of a human need into the desire of an object and the devel- opment of the capacity to tolerate pain which is intrinsic to the absence of the object of desire. Using her own words, the author states, “only desire can give rise to the activity of thought, the inalienable pleasure and privi- lege of man”. She develops this idea further by stating that thinking is not only painful but sometimes dangerous, because to think is to exist as a subject, to differentiate oneself from others, with all the risks associated with it.

The growing, older child excited and alarmed by Hansel and Gretel pushing the wicked witch into the oven may be reworking early encounters with the abhorrent mother but may as well be looking for imagery powerful enough to contain his or her abundant aggression around restrictions on autonomy or insults to self-regard, or may be anxious to explore life’s awful and marvelous possibilities.

In Jane Kilby’s analysis of how sexual trauma is ‘an unethical transgression of a skin boundary’, she oﬀers an understanding of skin as testimony. However, rather than suggesting that skin speaks, that it simply has a voice that can be heard by others, she suggests that the skin must be read, and that it is the reader who must embody the possibility of skin as testimony. In a close analysis of Louise Pembroke’s drawings about self-harm, Kilby shows how the self-harm testimony appears to deny any form of communication and dialogue.

What is more, one characteristic way in which these symbolic vocabularies operate in social discourse is by means of switchings or transcodings that draw on the con- ceptual elements of one domain in order to map the conceptual or experien- tial territory of another. According to Stallybrass and White, the body occu- pies a privileged place in this process as an “intensifying grid” through and upon which “transcodings between diff erent levels and sectors of social and psychic reality are eff ected” (26).

The progression of these narratives usually reveal that the idealized image of suburban life is itself an illusion (Lee’s father is revealed as having drinking problems and her parents’ marriage to be disintegrating), meaning that the pathological status of the young female protagonists comes to act as the sign of wider ‘pathologies’ within the family unit as a whole. In a similar structural movement to the logic of sacrifice described in Chapter 2, societal dysfunction is channelled through the suffering female body, a body which is read purely as a signifier rather than according to any individualized or self-ascertained cultural value. This conceptual drive has also been apparent in some of the feminist writing which has attempted to theorize female self-injury, parti…",

Yet, it is crucially important to keep sight of textual depictions of disability as representing very real human disability, and not merely as metaphor. As Michael Davidson puts it: “there are cases in which a prosthe- sis is still a prosthesis” (120); that is, in some cases “disability is not a metaphor” for something else but a reﬂection of “a lived reality” (120). In fact, the crit- ical displacement of the disabled or diseased body reﬂects the invisibility of disability in “polite” society.

And yet, Caitlin does not merely pause in her note-taking to contemplate a striking painting—an act to which some may relate. Rather, Caitlin is overwhelmed by the image. It draws her attention with such force that it pushes out all other thought. In an instant, her concern changes from transcribing the professor’s lengthy descriptions to the visceral image that looms before her. Indeed, Caitlin’s orientation changes so drastically that she is no longer even able to attend to the professor’s voice. The image and what it makes her feel is all. The painting ﬂoods Caitlin’s senses and is felt throughout her body. It ﬁlls her nose and throat with the coppery smell of blood. She feels its wet sticky gore upon her ﬁngers.

Jan’s now rigid body almost seems to be the space into which his phallus has expanded—the corpselike space where perhaps, paradoxically, Bess confronts the asexuated real of the body: by encountering the phallus in full like this, she is catapulted beyond the phallic function. Bess lights up upon hearing that Jan, although severely paralyzed, will live, seeming to have no thought about their lost sex life.

The sketch relies on organicist imagery; it is not a fully inte- grated body which we see (echoing with the creature’s in Frankenstein) but only a severed foot and hand. To put it simply, the hand gestures towards a higher authority, an older inspiration, whereas the artist reclines across the foot which represents more earthly, secular considerations. Within this tableau there is a juxtapo- sition of bodies in which the broken body of the Colossus is con- trasted with the human (complete) body of the artist. There is also a juxtaposition between the living and the dead and the real and the imaginary.

Language represents an effort to control through representation the traumatic separation that one must inevita- bly undergo; it is therefore always restless with desire for a presence it can only symbolize but never achieve. Because language is predicated upon the pain of absence, pain is inseparable from the pleasures of signiﬁcation. But emphasizing that pain underlying signiﬁcation—representing the gaps in language rather than representing that which is desired— offers the distinct pleasure of foregrounding the presence of language itself. One might prefer the representation of maternal absence to pres- ence, sunset to sunrise, pain to pleasure because it makes one conscious of the fact that one actually has language at hand (or a spool in hand).

Like Elkins (1997), we may feel that it is “painfully close to something I know I cannot or must not see” (p. 115). But we might glimpse something else as well. As we gaze upon the terribly violent death that the image documents, we may ﬁnd our eyes are drawn to the face of its victim. If we rest there and gaze upon her visage, we may perceive, like Kayla, her humanity. And, in her humanity, we may apprehend something of the mystery of existence. Looking at the woman’s counte- nance, despite—or perhaps because of—being at the moment of death, her face seems uplifted, almost joyous.2 She appears to stand in absolute deﬁance of the violence being perpetrated upon her physical body. It is as if she has risen above the vio- lence to which she is the closest witness.

I am a writer; I must play with the body of my mother. Schuyler does it; Barthes does it; Conrad does it; Ginsberg does it. Why is it so hard for me to do it? For while I’ve come to know my own body as a mother, and while I can imagine the bodies of a multitude of strangers as my mother (basic Buddhist meditation), I still have a hard time imagining my mother’s body as my mother. I can easily conjure my father’s body, though he has been dead thirty years. I can see him in the shower—tan, red, steaming, singing.

Her purpose was to be of use to other can- cer-sufferers who had been made to feel shame and humiliation, and indeed, this little book gave comfort to many thousands of patients and their families. In keeping with its utilitarian intent, the writing style was lucid and accessible, purged of that teasing, mystifying opacity that had charac- terized her earlier books. In examining the life-work of any writer, it is instructive to consider which themes, positions, or stylistic maneuvers are carried forth from the past, which ones abandoned or reversed—in other words, how the writer builds on infrastruc- tural footfalls he or she knows can be relied on, even as the new challenge is embraced.
