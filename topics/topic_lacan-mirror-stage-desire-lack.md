(narcissistic) desire for a pleasing image of the self. Logically, this means that there must already be a sense of lack because, from a Lacanian perspective, there can be no desire without lack. Deleuzians would disagree. But for Lacan desire cannot be dissociated from lack. So in the mirror stage there’s an alienation that’s already a lack of sorts. After the mirror stage comes language acquisition, which introduces the notorious Lacanian lack-in-being: the price that all of us pay to enter the symbolic order as socially intelligible (albeit neurotic) creatures. And language—as Žižek likes to remind us— “murders” the Thing, the originary (non)object.25 The result is full- blown desire: the desire to fill the void left by this originary object, which is always a fantasy object in the sense that it never existed. As I suggested in the context of claiming that the Lacanian subje…

as “lack of a real object.” The Lacanian solution is unsatisfactory. According to Deleuze and Guattari, for Lacan, need, not desire, is what gets defined in terms of lack. But, desire, even while producing both itself and the fantasy (by detaching from the object), makes the lack absolute, never fulfillable. Thus the relation of need to the object 205

intellectual, he escaped to the coast and joined some fishermen in a small fishing boat. One of the men pointed to a sardine can in the water and said to Lacan: ‘You see that can? Do you see it? Well, it doesn’t see you!’ (1994 [1973], 95, author’s italics). Lacan admits that he found it difficult at the time to see the humour in the man’s joke, since he was the object of it. But in reflection, it is a parable that allows him to articulate the function of the screen. Lacan’s mirror theory stresses the importance of the articulation of an ‘I’ as the entrance into the symbolic order. As Patrick Fuery argues in his Theories of Desire: ‘The subject, driven by desire, enters the mirror stage and subsequently the Symbolic in search of a satisfaction that can never be achieved. This is “desire” understood as an active process’ (1995, 17). Fundamentally what Lacan does through the mirror theory is to suggest an earlier drama to the Oedipal complex and a relationship between

the fulfilment of explicit demands can never provide satisfaction. Lacan’s account therefore straddles the divide between depth and surface. Following Hegel, Lacan conceives of desire as ‘a fundamental lack in being’, an incompleteness, which ‘the subject experiences as a disquiet- ing loss, and which prompt its activity of seeking an appropriate object

unconscious desire. Why do I stress Lacan’s well-known assault on the role of the image here? Well, because there is an echo in Lacan’s terms of critique that must not escape us. Psychology is time and again attacked for its objectify- ing qualities, and much the same is alleged of the self-objectifying ego’s captivation in images. Psychology itself is thus likened to the ego, viewed, indeed, as itself as egoic. We may take this argument further by consider- ing the elementary features of Lacan’s mirror-stage. The mirror stage involves the imaginary dynamics of the subject looking at, and as intrigued by, an image that they subsequently come to take on as themselves (as the basis of their ideal-ego). Such an image gives the subject an illusory sense of substantiality and identity; it affirms them in a persistent relation of misrecognition (méconnaissance); it enables them to be…

of the mirror stage, or at least the mirror stage in reverse. As Charles W. Bonner points out, most interpreters of Lacan have not paid much atten- tion to the significance of the body in his work, preferring to focus on the linguistic side or, I would add, the Orders and the gaze (232). Yet Lacan’s earlier works establish the importance of the body to the con- struction of the subject. Experienced initially as a heap of disparate parts, the body is straightened out or made “orthopaedic” by the subject’s desire (Écrits 4). But, of course, an autopsy takes the body back apart, punc- turing its surface manifestation along with the subject’s desire; now we desire to dismember the body. The skin will no longer disguise the body as one seamless fabric, the muscles as one harmonious kinesis, the bones as one symmetrical posture. I realized that as I was looking into the body’s inchoate parts, I was witnessing the subject’s undoing. And as the

prone to misrecognition of it. For Russell satisfaction comes with a state of quietude, yet what would produce this is often not what we take ourselves to find desirable. For Freud satisfaction comes with a reduction in the levels of tension. Our desires are manifestations of libidinal or destructive drives of which our particular goals are merely instances. Alternatively these drives get sublimated into objects, which strike us as attractive in themselves, yet turn out to be a replaying of the Oedipal drama. For Lacan satisfaction, although unachievable, is a state of fullness or plenitude. Our desiring activities originate in the sense of lack which the absence of such plenitude evokes. Within a model which sees the aim of desire as satisfaction, and also sees satisfaction as a state of plenitude which generates no further demands, it is clear why, to maintain subjectivity, our objects of demand must be permanently mismatched with what would provide such satisfaction.

symbolic (metaphorically suggested by Abramovic's use of language). But for all the seeming emphasis on those two psy- chic phenomena, Abramovic's attempts to mirror Ulay's identity suggest that the real corollary for this performance is the mirror stage. As Lacan makes clear, the mirror stage, especially its early moments, does not necessitate an actual mirror. For example, echoed sounds can suffice to introduce rudimentary notions of self-identity.2 The key point is that one knows oneself through representa- tions, and at the mirror stage the child realizes that representations of the self, whether they be images or sounds, are not the same thing as the self. Lacan describes the mirror stage as "a drama whose internal thrust is pre- cipitated from insufficiency to anticipa- tion—and which manufactures for the 31 Y 3

parents. A girl must identify with her mother and learn to be desirable, whereas a boy must identify with his father and learn how to desire. Lacan not only moves the stress to the castration complex but also shifts the focus to an earlier time, before the child realises that there is an Other to identify with. In this way, Lacan stresses a moment of alien- ation, in which the child realises that he/she is not complete and will never be again. As Bowie puts it: ‘Lacan’s account of the “specular” moment provides the ego with its creation myth and its Fall’ (1991, 21). Lacan’s ‘mirror stage’ proposes that a child from the age of six to eighteen months experiences a moment of identification when looking at her image in a mirror: The mirror stage is a drama whose internal thrust is precipitated from insufficiency to anticipation—and which manufactures for the sub- ject, caught up in the lure of spatial identification, the succession of

If we are to concisely reformulate Lacan’s use of the mirror (phase) in its more radical aspect, we could say here that what is in question for Lacan in the image of the mirror is more a matter of specular projection than of mimetic identification. Frow does evoke Freud’s idea of the ego as a “surface” and a “projection of a surface” (51) but isn’t able to make the most of this rather remarkable image, in part due to his lack of distinction between the three Lacanian registers, the symbolic, the imaginary, and the Real. We will return to this metaphor of the mirror shortly, but we can see that it functions at the heart of Frow’s concept of characterization in a complex way, in a sense, in a double way: It is to this dispersal of ego-​identifications that I wish to liken the work­ ings of fictional character. The “recognition” or “identification” of character that forms the basi…

please a woman and to be preferred by her to other men.”33 In short, the man who dreams of conquering the world wants to do so in order to access his erotic object. Here, the desire for mastery is nothing but the disguised articulation of another desire—the desire occasioned by the impossible object. The desire for mastery is itself never primary but always the displace- ment of another desire. If we think of desire in terms of mastery, we submit ourselves to the subject’s own self-deception. In Lacan’s conception of desire, the gaze is not the vehicle through which the subject masters the object but a point in the Other that resists the mastery of vision. It is a blank spot in the subject’s look, a blank spot that threatens the subject’s sense of mastery in looking because the subject cannot see it directly or successfully integrate it into the rest of its visual field. This is because…

description of the Mirror Stage is noteworthy for its specific application to Stephen’s growth in Chapter 2. He writes: “The mirror stage is a drama whose internal thrust is precipitated from insufficiency to anticipation.” If we synthesize Jung’s anima theory with Lacan’s notion of the Mirror Stage, it might be argued that Stephen’s self-directed gaze in the maternal mirror signifies his desire to move from a state of “insufficiency” to one of “anticipation” for a merging encounter with the anima (and the forgotten or repressed mother-image). Thus, he cross-dresses his psyche at the liminal threshold of the mirror—one of the earlier narrative indicators that Stephen’s

50 Lyotard Reframed that we want what we believe we do not have or is absent because we feel that it will somehow complete us. This lack, around which desire circles thereafter, will haunt the individual throughout his or her life, structuring all of their subsequent or derivative goals and pursuits. They will attempt to paper over or ﬁll this ‘hole’ in their being, produced as a result of this traumatic loss, by seeking a satisfying substitute (a lover, a job, a car, etc.). However, no object will ever be able to replace the mother (or least what she meant to the child) and thus, for Lacan, the human subject becomes deﬁned and delimited by the endlessly deferred fulﬁlment of its desire – an indeﬁnite, endless and ultimately futile search for an elusive ‘completion’. More importantly, for our purposes, it is clearly evident that Lacan’s account turns desire into a by- product of signifying processes: desire is fundamentally internal

the ‘I’ that is spoken of fail to coincide, so in the mirror stage we cannot both ‘see’, as subjective experience, and ‘be seen’, as object. ‘There is a fundamental gap or disjunction between these two operations’ (Parkin- Gounelas 2001: 6). Lacan’s therapeutic practice is centred on getting the individual to come to terms with his or her alienated identity, the fact that his or her desire for wholeness or completion is an illusion. Patients who have failed to accept the split in their identity remain in thrall to a state of being known as the Imaginary. They remain convinced that union with the ide- alized mirror image is possible because they refuse to accommodate them- selves to the fact that their identity is an effect of language. Lacan groups the linguistic and social structures, which pre-exist the subject’s entry into the world, under the collective term Symbolic. The Symbolic, w…

excesses of desire. Freud says as much when he situates the ego prior to the sexual drives it cannot manage and beyond these same drives, when the ego imagines the body to be more mature than it is. With Lacan, it is even more explicit insofar as he invents the well- known mirror stage. What is at stake in such a stage is a discordance, a fun- damental gap between a premature body and the anticipatory image of that body that is already mature. There is, therefore, a temporal gap between an incomplete body and its reflected image, one that is overly unified and elab- orate. There is also a gap between a body that experiences the distressing swarming of internal sensations, and its image that, before it, reflects it in a unified and jubilant manner. Sexuality emerges in the discordance between 79 LESSONS ON PAIN

beginning of his career, until at least the mid-1960s, desire was the centre of Lacan’s theoretical concern. Whatever he said or wrote up until this point was related directly or indirectly to desire. Lacan’s methodology for a conceptual- ization of desire was based on the logic of a multiple and non-totalizable interpretation. The logical outcome of this approach makes desire precisely impossible and inarticulable. This suggests that there would always be some- thing left over from any articulation of desire. Yet, desire is the only possible way for the subject to recover his lost being by means of a fantasy and with the mediation of an object a. Desire is born and sustained by a lack constituted by castration and the loss of the primitive object of satisfaction. Lacan’s suggestion that desire must be taken literally, has to be read metaphorically (though this may sound odd), b…

presented his essay "The Mirror Stage as Formative of the Function of the I as Revealed in Psychoanalytic Experience" [ 1949], in Serifs: A Selection, trans. Alan Sheridan [New York: Norton, 1977], 1-7.) In the whole context of Lacan's theory, the quoted passage seems to be a rare de-emphasis of vision; hence, I am choosing to characterize his theory in my own text as vision-privileging. In his Life and Death in Psychoanalysis, Jean Laplanche clarifies Lacan's de-emphasis of the mirror: "Lacan's intention is certainly not to link in any necessary way the appearance of the human ego to the cre- ation of the instrument of a mirror, nor even, for example, to the fact that like Narcissus, the infant can see his reflection on the surface of a body of water" (Jean Laplanche, Life and Death in Psychoanalysis, trans.

as external; desire’s discharge demands what the desiring subject lacks, demands an other. That desire, being about limits, must also be about oth- erness is central to the largely Freudian but more overtly linguistic and struc- tural psychoanalysis of Lacan. Lacan lacks Freud’s emphasis on the somatic. Indeed, as he in some regards replaces it with an emphasis on language, he might appear to be the other half of a psychoanalytic pair, with the desire between body and lan- guage demanding a synthesis of the two. But in fact neither sorts matters out quite so neatly. For Lacan as for Freud, desire arises in an originary experience that is at once lack and separation, absence and the seed of identity. The infant has no desires as such but only needs—basic, simple, and (if renewable) nonetheless temporarily satiable. Need is not linked to language; it expresses itself, as Luce Irigaray puts…

PART I THE INSISTENCE OF THE IMAGINARY Introduction: The Mirror Stage No piece of leftist cultural criticism of the 1970s and 1980s seemed com- plete without an account of Jacques Lacan’s theory of the mirror stage – that moment in the development of a small child when, contemplating its own reﬂ ection in a mirror, it delights in the magical correspondence between its own movements and those of the image before its eyes.1 Magical correspondences and miraculous afﬁ nities are the stuff of myth; and if Lacan’s essay ‘The Mirror Stage’ investigated such a myth, it rapidly became one in its own right. The boundaries between reality and make-believe, so Lacan argues, are blurred in this early phase: the ego, our window on the so-called real world, is really a kind of ﬁ ction, while the child before the mirror is said to treat its image as real even though it knows it to be illusory.…

pushing the identifications out and back in pursuit of the goal, which is always a yield of pleasure. And both depictions can be translated into the mirror-metaphor. If the line between ego and other were to be tilted so as to reveal itself as a plane, then it could be seen to be the mirror; if it were to be a surface not an edge, it would be seen as a reflecting one.4 Figure 2 Lacan’s ‘itinerary of the drive’.

later’.10 The mirror stage, then, in which the child glimpses that illusory wholeness which might one day be his or hers, promises a future moment of unity and self-sufﬁciency, but in reality this will always be subject to the threat of rupture, regression, dissolution. The subject takes one step forward, but two steps back; the Lacanian future is not a clear pathway down which we may conﬁdently stride forward, but a trajectory riven with the very schisms that threaten to split the subject. And the ego is our illusory friend in so far as it encourages us to shore up our Imaginary identiﬁcations with wholeness, rather than give ourselves over to the truth of the emptiness, rivenness and destitution that continue to haunt us.11 This counter-intuitive model of futurity is not surprising given Lacan’s afﬁliation to Freud, and Freud’s complex model of the workings of Eros and Thanatos. It is …

carving out for himself an experience of enjoyment which does not compromise, as it must necessarily do for the neurotic, his command over the visual ﬁeld. More precisely, this conﬁguration preserves the pervert’s immunity from the agency of the gaze, which would otherwise threaten to reveal the shameful secret of his (disavowed) castration, in other words his failure to assert his look seamlessly over the entirety of the visual ﬁeld. For all its evocative but somewhat confused hinting at the theory of perversion as psychic structure, however, “Instincts and Their Vicissi- tudes” never makes explicit the distinction I have drawn between desire’s perversity and perversion as such. For help on this issue we can turn once again to Lacan, whose refreshingly clear gloss on Freud’s presenta- tion of the scopophilia/exhibitionism couplet brings a greater level of conceptual precision to the pro…

What is posed at the beginning by Lacan as shadows and reflections, are the imaginary libidinal factors, the fixation of jouissance, etc, and evidently, the perspective is absolutely contrary, to the degree of considering that one can gather the symbolic relationship to the Other to blablabla, with regard to this curve of jouis8ance, closed in on itself, between quotation marks, "auto-erotic." There is an American novel called TIle Heart is a Lonely .Hunter. It's a great title, it says it well-One seeks the Other, and one seeks all alone. Here, in this zone that we are exploring, one could offer a contrary formula~Jouis8ance is a solitary prey. There, one does not hunt, it is there, and at the same time this solitude is not resolved by a hunt.

This produces an unseen difficulty for Lacan when he comes to use the notion of the virtual in a subjective scene. While the mirror is no original, the mind is active in its own interpretations, bringing them to pass. The figure makes it paradoxically hard to value the diversity the theory allows, since there is a ‘true’ and a ‘real’ shadowing the scene, albeit negatively. In effect, the mirror is judgemental, as is the rhetoric of the fictional, the imaginary, méconnaissance and trompe l’oeil, competing with a view of the subject which promotes the idiosyncratic scene of identity. The asymptotic metaphor has a similar limit, since it is fated to fall short of a ‘true’, a straight line, a perfection. These metaphors lead into the ‘ontology of lack’ perceived in Lacan and generally criticised.9 Yet, Lacan also conceives of the subject through the metaphor of the sign, in such a w…

console herself with thoughts of a time before she was castrated … But this, perhaps, is to get ahead of ourselves. The Mirror Phase And The Imaginary For Lacan, we are born too soon.We can’t walk, talk or see. We begin as broken people. At some point, however, we encounter an image of ourselves in a mirror and begin to identify ourselves as a distinct person in the world, separate from others. The image seems to be better than us and is external to ourselves, so this identiﬁcation is problematic in itself. This process is the Mirror Phase and it allows us to enter into the realm of the Imaginary – with the emphasis being on the idea of the image. This Mirror Phase can act as a metaphor for what we do in the cinema – and this idea was developed by Christian Metz.We sit in the dark, quietly (Metz clearly doesn’t go to your average multiplex), and don’t move, whilst watching an image of a person who is much bigger, stronger, more intelligent, braver and more

the semblance of the Other’s desire with which the hysteric at- tempts to cover over her imaginary lack (-φ). This a, which Lacan in Seminar XV calls the ‘source of the mirage of the all’, is what ensures that her count will always, Achilles-like, either over- or un- dershoot its mark. The reason for this permanent over- or under-shooting lies in the fact that the ﬁ eld of representation, the site where the fantasy is ‘staged’, is not ﬂ at but is topologically distorted by the a insofar as it belongs to another order than the symbolic ‘count’ and its imag- inary staging. As a real object, the a, in Badiou’s terms partakes of the ‘errancy of the void’.66 Created in the original nominal act 65. See Lacan’s discussion of the hysteric’s fantasy in Seminar VIII, Transference, lesson of 19.4.61. For a refreshingly lucid explanation of this formula, see Verhaeghe, On Being Normal and Other Disorders, pp. 373-81.

as early as 1954 during his Seminar II, Lacan announces that he himself finds the mirror stage a dated concept. And his discovery of the objet a as the nodal point of his theory of desire in 1962 leads him to emphasize that this object is precisely what eludes the mirror image.22 The problem with the idea of the mirror stage is that it leads to an emphasis on the imaginary at the expense of the real, which is why Screen theory’s focus on this essay leads to a dead end. But even within the confines of the mirror stage essay itself, Screen theory performs a butchered operation on Lacan’s concept. According to Lacan, the infant between the ages of six and eighteen months has a fragmented experience of its body and has yet to develop an ego. At some point during this period, however, the infant looks in a mirror and sees a whole being instead of a fragmentary one. This deceptio…

lacks noted above (of object, jouissance and being) indicates that for Lacan each such aspect of the subject is best grasped not within the parameters of the object—that is, as an entity capable of a clear ontological status—but rather according to a trajectory of lack. The ego can accordingly be conceptualized as simultaneously caught up within, and formed by, the wishful illusion of its own substantiality. The culture of the ego In Seminar I Lacan warns his audience that there is a fundamental error in cleaving “to the idea that the subject’s ego is identical to the presence that is speaking to you.”52 This is the problem when an “objectifying case of mind” (that is, a psychologizing approach) slides from the ego defined as the perception-consciousness system—that is, as the system of the subject’s objectifications—to the ego conceived of as the correlate of an absolute real…

cording to Baudry. In the cinema, one can gain a sense of iden- tity through the act of seeing heroic figures on the screen. I see Sandra Bullock or Denzel Washington acting in a specific way, and I model myself on them. The filmic screen functions like a mirror. This enables me to gain the illusion of subjectivity and the sense of belonging that comes with that subjectivity. For Lacan, the subject misrecognizes itself in the form of an ego through the mirror stage, and in this sense, the mirror stage represents a turn away from subjectivity rather than the constitution of it. But for Screen theory, the outcome of the mirror stage is not the ego but the subject that conceives itself as the master of what it sees. The difference is not simply

there is no straightforward and integrated account to be derived from Lacan's transcribed seminars and written texts. Although one might argue that the later ruminations in The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis somehow supersede the earlier ones on the "mirror stage," Lacan himself never explicitly rejected his first attempts to understand ego formation and aggression in largely visual terms. Understandably, the contributors are thus able to find inspiration in different Lacanian arguments about vision. Yet even when certain Lacanian texts are privileged over others, the results are by no means always uniform. Thus, for example, in considering the mirror-stage argument, Helga Geyer-Ryan employs it as a way to explain the creation of fragile national identi- ties, which can be threatened by external penetration that produces regression to an even more archaic stage of abjection. Ernst van Alphen, on the other hand, implies that the mirror can serve

a Lack, there can be no cause either of language, or, therefore, the sub­ ject. The primary processes, tracing a route of condensation and displacement appear as the impulsion in the unconscious; they can now be seen to be the effective presence of desire and it is for this reason that Lacan claims that desire, ‘more than any other point on the human spectrum makes the presence of the unconscious felt’. Now we can see the full implication of the claim that the uncon­ scious is constructed in the same process by which the subject acquires

ment of her body—“She examined her new breasts with curiosity. . . . She found a little diadem of fresh hairs tufting between her thighs” (124)—she comes to recognize her reflection in the mirror for what it is, an intimate disappointment. This habitual, at last boring, fidelity to her every movement finally woke her up to the regretful possibility that her compan- ion was, in fact, no more than a particularly ingenious variety of the shadow she cast on sunlit grass. . . . A little moisture leaked from the corners of her eyes, yet her relation with the mir- ror was now far more intimate since she knew she saw herself within it. (124) Wolf-Alice recognizes herself in the mirror not as the ideal-I, the coher- ent self of Lacan’s mirror stage (for Lacan, a misrecognition) but rather as shadow, as reflection, and it is this different recognition that keeps her from entering into the Symbolic Order, keeps her outside of language.

and transform his product at the ﬂ ick of a ﬁ nger or the turn of a head. To perform in front of a mirror involves a kind of inﬁ nite regress or mise en abyme, as the Gestalt in the glass beams approvingly at the child’s endeav- ours, thus provoking his smile, which in turn cues another supportive sign of delight from the reﬂ ection, and so on. We shall see something of the same dialectic later, in – of all things – eighteenth-century moral philosophy. It was not, to be sure, as though the cultural theorists of the time were particularly enthralled by the topic of child development. The importance of Lacan’s lecture lay in its illustration of the imaginary – that strange realm of the human psyche in which subjects and objects (if we can even speak of such a division at this early point) appear constantly to exchange places and live each other’s lives. In this play of projecting…

comprehended as a realization of male desires; she can only be seen to see herself through the perspective of a male gaze. Lacan’s answer to this mistaken interpretation of his formula is simply that we have no image of the Other’s desire (it remains indeterminate), and it is this very lack that causes our desire. It is first of all an unsatisfied desire that initiates our own, one that is not filled up with meaning, or has no signified. That that desire is unsatisfiable is a secondary truth resulting from this primary condition. To all those who describe the subject as a fiction of extravagant prostheses, a prosthetic god manufactured by (and in the image of the desire of) a cultural order, we must now issue a reply. It is not the long arm of the law that determines the shape and reach of every subject, but rather something that escapes the law and its determination, something we can’t …

they are not retroactively understood on the basis of the Oedipus complex qua per- manent symbolic structure of the subject. More generally, it is important to note how, despite its marginal thematization in Lacan’s early works, desire clearly con- stitutes the primary force underlying all the subject’s imaginary dialectical move- ments. This is why Lacan speaks of a “see-saw of desire”54 made of successive projections and introjections. 1.4 Consciousness, the Unconscious, and the Complexes One last dialectical movement still awaits explanation in Lacan’s theory of the subject’s imaginary psychic development. It is indeed clear that the subject’s in- trojection of the ego as the primary (alienating) identiﬁcation (Ur-Ich) has to follow—if not chronologically, at least logically—a primordially unconscious projection/representation of the (other’s) body image as such. Imagos must some- how be “produced” by the subject: as a matter of fact, Lacan deﬁnes them as “un-

of seeing. This is supported by the position of the projector, which is located behind the viewer’s head and thus condemns the technology from his field of view. The viewer-subject is thus understood as a product of the cinematographic apparatus.” (Alexander Böhnke, in: Schanze 2002, p. 10) Here, the ego-constitut- ing function of the mirror stage according to Lacan can be added, which wants to (and does) make the viewer perceive the events on the screen as ‘reality’. The mirror stage is interesting insofar as the infant, for the first time in front of his mirror image, considers his body parts as belonging together, thus establishing a new order of perception. The film achieves something similar through the selec- tive presentation of a preconceived order. Cinema can be seen as a reconstruction of the Lacanian model.

recognition. He wants the (m)Other’s unconditional love. That is why the subject is left unsatisfied by the objects he receives from her. It is not because they don’t satisfy him. It is because they are for the subject proofs of love, and no matter how many proofs he receives, at bottom they are not what the subject demands. The subject demands not proofs of love but her love, the thing itself, the substance of the (m)Other’s enjoyment that, naturally, she cannot give. As Lacan famously puts it in Seminar eight Transference and elsewhere, to love is to give someone what you do not have. What you cannot give is your lack or desire. What remains, then, when you subtract need from demand? Nothing at all – that is to say, this lack or void in the subject that is his desire. Why is the subject plagued by this negativity? Lacan accounts for it in various ways. Let me focus here on his notion of the forced choice in Seminar

cism is filled with discussions of the “Mirror Stage” every time someone walks past a mirror, but we do see this stage as a part of social and individual development often in children’s literature. Lacan’s other major concept is that of Lack. The Self is seen as always lack- ing something that, if it could only get that something, would make the Self complete. Since the Self is constituted by being separate from the Other, this Lack can never be filled. In Edgar Allan Poe’s The Purloined Letter, no one ever learns what is in the letter; it is the letter itself, or rather, its Lack, that drives the entire plot. If we go back to Saussurean terms, the sign made up of the signifier and the signified, we can interpret the letter as a signifier without, for most of the story, any sig- nified attached to it. Therefore, people can pour into that empty signifier all manner of interpretations. What is in the letter is what other people Lack and thus want to find in it.

the impulses and urges of humanity, its needs and wants, are open to major “qualitative” (as opposed to minor “quantitative”) alterations. For Lacanian psychoanalysis, the newness of difference and the oldness of repetition inter-penetrate one another at the level of the libidinal economy.66 Speciﬁcally in relation to the present discussion, this means that, through the inﬂuences of drives and desires, there will always be (to paraphrase “Creative Writers and Day-Dreaming”) a thread of wishful consistency stringing together past, present, and future. Or, in Lacanese, “there is the One” (“Y a d’l’Un”), even when one-ness appears to be liquidated in rapidly moving streams of changes. Freud and Lacan insist that relating to the future via libidinal mechanisms invariably risks falsifying it through its reduction to illusory compensations for and resolutions of past grievances. If this is the case, then, contra Marcuse, what a utopian politics needs is not new needs (as tied

table linguistically, in this order, as appropriate things to want (see below for the link between this and other surface accounts). The fulfilment of these demands, however, does not yield satisfaction. For what the child actually wants is the impossible plenitude of union with another, which is impossible once they have become subjects. Consequently the apparent intentional objects of desire are merely its vehicles. The apparent satisfaction of the intentional objects of demands leaves a residual desire (for Lacan unconscious) for the imagined but impossible union with the other, which can never be satisfied. The lack of satisfaction of the imaginary desire then prompts another series of demands. The sense of lack fuels the desiring process. In the words of Bruce Fink Desire, strictly speaking has no object. In its essence, desire is a constant search for something else, and there is no specifiable object that is capable of satisfying

same knee-jerk reaction to the ego as Lacan: you have explained convincingly that for Klein the ego’s integration is a matter of being able to cope with ambivalence, anxiety, and conflict rather than an attempt to shore up mastery over the unconscious. From this vantage point, Klein’s objective is the same as Lacan’s: to dissolve the defenses that get in the way of the discourse of the unconscious. Klein just assumes that some of these defenses are more primordial than repression. I’m willing to accept that. That said, I think that Lacan’s antipathy toward the ego isn’t just about repression. It also has to do with the possibility that the subject might be overtaken by self-aggrandizing fantasies. As I’ve noted, Lacan connects the ego to the mirror stage—the idea being that the inception of the ego takes place during the mirror stage— and the obvious problem, as I’ve establish…

themselves in the form of something that disturbs the certainties of the ego and resists integration into common discourse. While these two reasons are valid, they are insufficient. For Lacan could have easily limited himself to bringing the methodological diffi- culties that plague any drive theory to the fore. Yet he clearly wants to do more, namely, construct the drama of an insurmountable conflict between drives and the symbolic. This drama of an impossible recon- ciliation is so important to him that he goes so far as to give us two substantially different versions of it in Seminar 2. According to the first version, what is repeated in the compulsion to repeat and what does vio- lence to the pleasure principle through this repetition is a reality (for This content downloaded from 130.226.229.16 on Fri, 13 Mar 2020 12:54:45 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms

and this mirror effect is magnifi ed in his attraction to fi lm. Subsequent developments in Lacanian psychoanalysis—particularly his revisions to the Freudian Oedipus Complex, his location of lack and absence as the engine of desire, and his notions of the gaze so seminal to psychoanalytic fi lm theory—provide a framework and language for articulating David’s obsessions. He returns compulsively to a primal eroticized encounter with his mother, reenacting it vicariously on fi lm and in the fl esh with Sully. However, unlike Oedipus, David never successfully indulges his taboo incestuous desires. Instead he remains transfi xed by fantasies, dreams, and misrecognized refl ections from the pool of Narcissus. The Mirror Stage Lacan’s theories of the Mirror Stage draw upon a number of sources, but one of the most important is Freud’s “On Narcissism: An Introduction.” Freud complicates pathological views of narcissism by positing that “primary

ironically, does not seem to be a question of my act of seeing. Th e illusion of naturalness renders the subjective distortion of the visual ﬁ eld—its reliance on our act of seeing to constitute it—almost impossible to detect. But it is not quite impossible. We see this distortion of desire pri- marily in works of art, like ﬁ lms or paintings, where the constitutive role of our subjectivity can become more prominent. In his Seminar XI Jacques Lacan names the distortion that desire pro- duces in the visual ﬁ eld le regard or the gaze. Th e introduction of this term immediately opens Lacan to a horrible misunderstanding that derailed Anglo-American ﬁ lm theory for decades.  Th e gaze, as Lacan theorizes it, is not the simple act of looking and the mastery involved in that act (as the English-speaking interpreters of Lacan had it), but rather the point at which the distortion…

tunately unsatisfiable desire (the ego neither assimilates—eats—the other nor is eaten by it; nor does it foreclose the other, excluding, rejecting, and relegating it into the Real, where It enjoys and the ego does not “know” it). Nevertheless, as Lacan was first to point out, this “symbolic” agree¬ ment retains a certain stamp: that of “the aggressive character of primitive competition [which] leaves its mark on every type of discourse about the small other, about the Other as third party, about the object” (p. 39). In each of these the potential for a paranoid, “primordially competitive” re¬ lation remains. The fragmented ego, belittled by comparison with the full¬ ness of the Other, is literally tormented, the ironic butt of the commands to an enjoyment that can never be complete for it qua fragmented body. In the regime of the Superego, the signifier-as-separation has beco…

of the experience—within the aesthetic structure of the film, and it is the point at which the spectator is obliquely included in the film. This conception of the gaze entails a different conception of desire than the one that has pre- dominated in early Lacanian film theory. As the indication of the spectator’s dissolution, the gaze cannot offer the spectator anything resembling mastery. Desiring Elsewhere Though Lacan does claim that imaginary identification produces the illusion of mastery in his essay on the mirror stage, even at this early point in his thought he does not see desire as such as a desire for mastery. Early Lacan- ian film theory’s conception of desire actually has more in common with Nietzsche and Foucault than it does with Lacan, which is one reason why Joan Copjec claims that “film theory operated a kind of ‘Foucauldinization’ of Lacanian theory.”22 For both Nietzs…

we are never dealing with a centered subject, but one that confronts its own negative dimension by way of a radical doubt. This is where the top of the Lacanian graph of desire is at its most relevant, where we recognize the absence of an Other for the Other. But the top of the graph, the zone of pure desire, is absent of the (A), which recognizes only the barred subject; with the anarchistic desire the (A) becomes obscenely disap- pointed, making demands on a barred subject that is entirely unaware of its own position except for its being mocked by the Other’s demand. The (A) is itself not composed of this imaginary stuff that will uphold our preferred visions of ourselves. It will, instead, subvert us into a disappointing position that completes the cycle to the return of the barred subject, unaware of itself until it has been approved of in the lower part of the graph.

altogether in the self-reflexive collapse of its ecstatic frenzy. To the contrary, only the institution of the symbolic first introduces the differential negativity that constitutes the absence in experience as a privation, and it never sum- marily sublates this disturbance in the Real. While originally he conceives neurotic suffering as symptomatic of the imaginary obfuscation of the lack of symbolic castration, Lacan thus comes to conceive it rather as symptom- atic of the struggle to maintain the symbolic lack necessary to sustain one’s desire, in light of the imposing proximity of the Real. And rather than more fully assuming the lack of symbolic castration, he comes to see the end of

awkward at this stage to plead for the re-vision enabled by a perspec¬ tive more explicitly indebted to psychoanalytic ontologies: after all, the critical playing out of oedipal dramas and agons, especially with Wordsworth, recalls that very scene whose time had come and gone a decade ago, a type of inquiry that needed to make way so that other kinds of questions could be asked, ones that depended less on an implicitly held autotelic nature of literary texts. But it is exactly at this point that I would stake my claim for re-visioning the Romantic poetic world of longing. It is true that Freud is Lacan's fodder; but the ways in which he complicates his philosophical father allow us a new path back into the issues of power, sexuality, and expression. Such a critical analysis in no way competes against other kinds of study for su¬ premacy; it seeks instead to complicate explana…

The major issue in Lacan's late work is how the subject in analysis can be brought to abandon the endless perturbations of the Other's desire in order to begin dealing with his or her drive. The essential question that perturbs the subject and encourages him or her to seek analysis is: What am I for the desire of the Other?

I do not have space here to go into as detailed an analysis of Lacan’s article with its complex history as it deserves. Suffice it to say here that any psychoanalytical discussion of fascist ideology and mass politics must reckon with Lacan’s ‘Mirror Stage’. Recognizing the affinities between Lacan and Benjamin in this respect, Miriam Bratu Hansen points out that ‘fascism has perfected a method of mobilizing the masses that at once paralyzes their practical, moral, and political judgement and provides a collective imaginary that would

enjoyment could be deﬁned as the ﬁnal result of eliminating the discrepancy between need and desire generated via the fateful ontogenetic detour through the mediation of demand, Lacan reiterates, in this later context, the earlier critiques of utopianism articulated in the ﬁfth and seventh seminars. Reaching for an underemployed distinction deployed in the twentieth seminar of 1972-1973, the various utopias Lacan has in mind can be interpreted as fantasmatic anticipations of “jouissance expected” — this expected jouissance, for several psychoanalytic reasons, is never equivalent to any instance of the “jouissance obtained” under desire-driven constraints.44 Obviously, the kind of utopia rendered unattainable by the impossibility of jouissance (as an actually realized state of full, undiluted enjoyment) is that of an entirely happy set of sustainable circumstances in which all serious dissatisfactions are resolved without remainder,

33 A Theory of the Subject For Lacan, it is clear: the man suddenly fears that by showing his newest acquisition, he will in fact reveal only an ontological lack. That toward which his entire existence—his desire and his identity included—was aimed seems to be “a thing of nothing.” All of a sudden, the “lack of being” on which as a libidinal being he rests, threatens to rise up with- out protection to the surface. Here, there is no single signiﬁ er to deﬂ ect attention, while the presence of the audience prevents him from dreaming himself away (i.e., of fading away into his phantasm). A direct, unmedi- ated confrontation with this lack can no longer be avoided. Should his object undergo such a “sacrilege,” the subject—that is, the object rela- tion—can only creep away in shame and anxiety, unwilling to succumb to this confrontation. In his collection, a collector discovers precisely the phantasm so as to be spared this confrontation and this shame. This is

phallus) nor can the mother either, since the lesson of the Oedipal rule imposed by the father is that she too lacks (is lacking) it. What happens thereafter is that the subject finds substitutes or displacements for the missing thing, now repressed into (and thereby forming) the unconscious. Those substitutes or displacements thus fill the space of Desire, and will ever after represent an alienation of the subject from that which it desires, now symbolized in objects, Lacan's other 'little things' representing the autre - the objet petit a. This dialectical movement from recognition of lack to a desire to fill it is well illustrated in the Ramsays' relations with Charles Transley. Like young James, Charles Tans ley is still visibly struggling with his Oedipal relationships. Since Tansley obviously is beyond the mirror stage in his psychic development, his desire is represente…

emphasis. However, the understanding of Lacanian theory developed in the essays that follow can best be understood by distinguishing it from the Lacanian film theory it aims to replace. In other words, in order to see the direction in which these essays will take Lacanian theory, we must pay attention to the limitations that have plagued Lacanian film theory in the past. The narrowness of Lacanian film theory manifested itself chiefly in two ways: in the way that film theory appropriated Lacanian psychoanalysis and in the way that film theory approached cinematic experience. Let us look at each of these in detail. AN IMAGINARY LACAN Film theory’s understanding of Lacan was largely mistaken. It had the effect of placing an undue importance on the role of the mirror stage—and the category of the imaginary—in Lacanian theory. This misplaced emphasis began with Christian Metz and J…

being central to Lacan’s thought; it is believed that, for Lacan, the referent is the “lack,”9 which to some observers links Lacanian the- ory, by a simple specular reversal, to the traditional conception of the referent as substance, to the “metaphysics” of presence. But in reality this common interpretation itself misses the di- mension of the “lack,” or rather of “failure” [manquement] in La- can. The comparison with Austin is particularly enlightening: for no more than Austin does Lacan deal with the lack, but rather with the act of lacking or missing (failing, misﬁring, falling short: “the collimator doesn’t work”), which is entirely different from the “lack.” “We shall see how by means of repetition, as repetition of 

of this for Badiou’s project is that mathematical formalization can only be, as it was for Lacan, an ideal. Yes, desire is an illusion premised on misrecognition; an empty, baseless surplus over being. And yes, as Badiou maintains, the real—being—is no doubt best conceived in thought as a pure, inaccessibly and inconsistently infinite multiplicity from which nothing is missing, in which nothing lacks. Yet for all the evidence of its duplicity and unreliability, the greatest illusion of all is the one that upholds the possibility of the psyche’s absolute dissipation. Though psychoanalysis certainly does not deny the possibility of the experience of being, for the speaking subject being in language, in consciousness, is always barred, unattainable, unsatisfying, elsewhere.

Do we imagine the other as one who lacks and wants, as desiring, as calling us in to ﬁll a gap? What provocation is in place when we are looked at in this inscrutable way? ‘What does the other want of me?’ is meant to be the most insistent question that the subject asks of the social order (the Big Other) in which it ﬁnds itself.

mirror [stage].”44 This was a point that Lacan had made already in his first proposal of the mirror stage when he promised that “psychoanalysis may accompany the patient to the ecstatic limit of the ‘Thou are that,’ in which is revealed to him the cipher of his mortal destiny.”45 The problem with the structural unity of Plato’s Phaedrus which has vexed so much so many honorable scholars is resolved once we take into consideration the connec- tion between the mirror of eros in which the beloved is immortalized and writing, in its close association with death, funerary practices, and monu- ments.

The breaking of the chalk at the board was both an articulation of how I was feeling (“pressured at the board”) and a potential solution to the pressure I was experiencing: “if I'm incompetent then I won't have to teach!” The unconscious recreated a harmony with the real by giving content to the enigmatic gaze of my students through the symptom of breaking the chalk. The gap functions in a very specific way in Lacan's conception of the mechanisms of the unconscious, but we can say that Lacan also makes a broader and more profound point about the gap and the relationship between cause and effect that holds for all inter- object relations.

faction of the drives is hallucinatory; why the objects of desire, whether fantasmatic or material, become libidinally invested only through lack and signiﬁcation, that is, through desexualization; and why reality as such can be deﬁned only through desexualization. 21 Lacan makes explicit Freud’s paradoxical understanding of the drive’s capacity to ﬁnd satisfac- tion even in the inhibition of its aim. If its goal is satisfaction, it can attain satisfaction even from failing to attain this goal. Why is this so? Because, as Lacan suggests, the aim involves not only the attainment of a speciﬁc object, but a particular mode of attainment, an itinerary the drive must undertake in order to access its object or to gain satisfaction from some other object in its place. There is always a pleasure in this detour — indeed this is what pleasure is, a movement rather than a possession, a pro…

date. I share Cowart’s misgivings about overburdening DeLillo’s fi ctional texts with more theoretical apparatus than they can bear. But like him I also believe that judicious application of theory to DeLillo’s art can prove mutually illuminating for both. I frankly doubt that Don DeLillo is well versed in the writings of Jacques Lacan, and I make no claims for direct, intentional infl uence. Nevertheless, a number of Lacan’s key concepts— including his theory of the Mirror Stage, his revisions to Freud’s Oedipus Complex, his emphasis on lack as the engine of desire, and his refl ections on dreams, fantasies, and the gaze—are particularly useful for taking the full measure of DeLillo’s fi rst novel, Americana .

To the extent that Lacan is concerned with the displacement of subjectivity in the symbolic order of language and culture ± as when he writes of ``the incessant sliding of the signi®ed under the signi®er'' (Lacan 1977: 154) ± Lacan moves well beyond the Enlightenment concerns of Freud. Indeed, his work provides a foundation for poststructuralist accounts of the mani- festation of unconscious fantasy in ideology. Thus for Slavoj Zizek (1988), the desires and fantasies that were once thought to be the private purview of the individual subject are actually experienced and subverted at the level of social and cultural ideology. Selfhood exists not in private spheres, but in ideological discourse. In contrast to the relational perspective, the Lacanian and post-Lacanian account of personal experience is de®ned by lack, emptiness, and depletion. Indeed, as the chapters in this book suggest, there remains a considerable gap between the work of American postmodern relational analysts and the

Baudrillard, for very different reasons, has argued that " . . . in Foucault power takes the place of desire. It is there in . . . a network, rhizome, a contiguity diffracted ad infinitum. That is why there is no desire in Foucault: its place is already taken." Jean Baudrillard, Forget Foucault (New York: Semiotext, 1977) 1 7-18.

side itself, and subject to that order. In Lacan’s complex narrative of mir- ror relations, the child desires to be what the mother desires. But both mother and child are themselves already located within the Symbolic order of language and culture, in which the mother’s desire is governed by the ‘law of the Father’.65  According to Lacan, desire is always deferred in the Symbolic Order, always beyond the subject’s grasp owing to that initial separation between mother and child. Desire is remembered through the process of the mirror stage, where the fantasy of desire was fictionalized for the child as something attainable. In her essay ‘The Gothic Mirror’ (1985), Claire Kahane reads Lacan’s theory into the very narrative structure of Gothic fiction:  Within an imprisoning structure, a protagonist, typically a young woman whose mother has died, is compelled to seek out the center of a my…

Lacan summarises the fault he sees in ego-psychology as an intellectual one: ‘thus at best the present day analyst leaves his patient at the point of purely imaginary identification in which the hysteric remains captive’. An analysis that has found yet another fixation for the desire, another ‘cure’. But this leaves the subject still in the cycle of appropriating objects to the demand; it leaves him in the chains of metonymy of desire. Instead, Lacan prescribes ‘the freedom to avow one’s desire’, and it is ‘what the subject tolerates least easily’. In refusing to satisfy in the register of demand, the analyst follows through a technique from elsewhere: interpreting resistance, rather than allowing it to perform its reality-giving function. ‘Since no obstacle is put in the way of the subject’s avowal of his desire, it is towards this avowal that he is directed, even shepherded.’ …

that relationship. For Kristeva, like Lacan, what is at issue is the birth of desire, or the transition from need to desire. She is concerned with how the autoerotic body gives way to the speaking subject. At the level of desire, Kristeva agrees with Lacan's theories of the mirror stage, castration, the oedipal situation, and sexual difference. But she argues that Lacan discounts the semiotic drive force operating prior to the mirror stage and the oedipal situation. She claims that there is evidence that the logic of signification, the logic that organizes the mirror stage and the oedipal situation, is already operating within the material bodies of children prior to what Lacan identifies as the onset of the subject. Also, there is evidence of semiotic drive force on the surface of children's early language use. Semiotic drive force makes its way into language. It is not completel…

tions of the Greek romances. Much, much more could have been writ- ten. First, a number of caveats concerning Lacan. As did Plato, Lacan created, revised and abandoned numerous ideas throughout his contro- versial career. Lacan is difficult and my understanding of him comes largely from reading works on Lacan and from literary critics who em- ploy Lacan’s approaches, and my use of him is synthetic.3 Finally, at least in the USA, psychoanalysis remains in considerably bad odor, even within psychology departments. What Does the Lover Really Love, Anyway? To begin with, Lacan clearly distinguishes a need, like the need for drink, food or even sex, items which can be satisfied, from Desire, which cannot.4 Lacan suggested that Desire’s true goal is an imagined, primordial (but impossible) full personal wholeness and non-contingent being. In the formation of Desire and of the need for some Oth…

Lacan, in such a way that who came first does not matter—and that Lacan’s negativity, his hollowing out of ego into a treacherously anx¬ ious location of identity, helps objectify the subject—to imply, at least, the contingency of the subject upon all it inhabits, its aleatory organi¬ zation, along with the sense that in this contingency the subject invar¬ iably becomes an object for someone and something else. I am quite aware that in a reflexive critical act, I have brought into being the optatives I often articulate as being of the text. I reach back, through Lacan, to activate an individualist—versus social—economy of literary expression, using (as all heuristics are) a tendentious probe—Lacanian language. Such paradigmatic desire was not a self-conscious poetic predication, an authorially intended commodity; but this truth does not invalidate its historical presence as u…

Playfully, he may move a limb to make the child in the mirror move a limb, or laugh to see the child laugh, and so is motivated by his desire to see his specular image move; but he misrecognizes his own movement as his command over the specular image, when it is the latter who summons desire to move the former. Unity and wholeness are thus misconceptions of the cogito for Lacan. They are based on a false pretense, since the mirror stage, a stage wherein the perceiving subject misrecognizes himself, is the foundational experience of human consciousness. For Lacan, the cogito is not unified, hence his reworking of Descartes’s “I think therefore I am,” replacing it with: “I am thinking where I am not, therefore I am where I am not thinking” (Lacan 2002: 157). When patterns of self-deception are revealed as coordinates that bar us from knowing the trauma of the cut from our own i…

as perception refers to desire, the moment when reality is merely incidental. In short, this painting looks at me to the precise extent that I cannot see it. Regarding the move to excess relative to a representative model, Lacan refers immediately to Merleau-Ponty’s ideas:

ceived in order for the viewer, cyborg‑like, to effect an unconscious fantasmatic internalization of the apparatus, allowing it to function as a sensory‑perceptual prosthetic. Now, this last point—Metz’s intimation, never explicitly argued, that the abstract synthetical apperception underlying spectatorship features a properly fantasmatic instance—is the one that can most helpfully be strengthened with a further reference to Lacan. It was Lacan, after all, who rigorously formalized the subjective function as the correlation between an absence of signifying material—a gap or failure in the sig‑ nifying chain, but also an associated wavering, opacity, or de‑realization of form or image—and an immaterial object of fantasy by means of which this gap can potentially be filled, this inadequacy rectified. This, then, is my suggestion: the visual pleasure that film theory associates with spectatorship occurs in consequence of the gratification

CHAPTER ONE Lacanian shibboleth from a rather different vantage point from the cus¬ tomary attacks launched on it, I consider it necessary to elaborate a methodological qualification regarding the status of conceptual models in Lacan’s work. As is well known, throughout his career Lacan borrows models, ideas, and terminology from other disciplines to theorize sub¬ jectivity in increasingly complex ways. These disparate models and their accompanying terminology come and go with such dizzying frequency in Lacan’s work that we would be mistaken in too readily hypostasizing any one of them. For instance, when furnishing his seminar audience with an optical model for grasping the imaginary order’s functioning, Lacan makes clear that this model of the inverted bouquet represents “a substitute for the mirror-stage” (SI 74). The model of the inverted bouquet offers a different way—perhaps at the moment it is introduced

a possibility. In this respect an analogy arises between Radcliffe’s figure of the heroine on a threshold and Lacan’s mirror stage. For both, to move ‘forward’ is to enter a state of ‘desire’, of endlessly deferred presence.69  For Miles, then, Radcliffe’s Gothic heroines hover on the threshold of adulthood, deprived of their own choice of suitor, denied their mothers.

prefer some articulations that are objectively less eff ective, that save me from the trouble of fully facing the Real. It is thus worth interrogating the claim that Lacanian theory is in a privileged position to approach the encounter with the Real. Beyond a personal idiosyncratic preference (perhaps for obscure French writing, playful neologisms or complex mathematical schema), what grounds this claim? For my part, I ground it in the existence of psychoanalysis as a practice. When adapting psychoanalytic theory to political ends, it is oft en tempting to forget that psychoanalysis is also a practice, a treatment that aims to make some kind of transformation in the subjects who seek it out. In the face of the deadlocks that Lacanian psychoanalytic theory explains – the impossibility of recovering our lost objects or escaping our excessive attachments – psychoanalysis nonetheless continues to off er itself as a
