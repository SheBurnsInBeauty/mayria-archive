I feel that its mere presence changes my reading, that I am looking at a new photograph, marked in my eyes with a higher value. This ‘detail’ is the punctum. It is not possible to posit a rule of connection between the studium and the punctum (when it happens to be there). It is a matter of co-presence, that is all one can say...’’49 Barthes argues that the Punctum, the element of a photograph which touches you personally and singularly, is an important

Reilly (New York: Columbia University Press, 2012), 113. Éric Marty (Roland Barthes, la littérature et le droit à la mort, 29) mentions A Lover’s Discourse and Thrène, but not the other examples given here. Barthes’s ‘Journal- Moisson’ from the ‘Atelier sur la Voix’, which is reproduced in Le Lexique de l’auteur, refers to the reading of the Mallarmé passages for Thrène in the entry dated 30 January 1974 (LA, 365); Éric Marty’s editorial notes in Barthes’s Album state that the actual recording took place on 19 January (AL, 19). I have been unable to determine precisely when Barthes became aware of Mallarmé’s text, but, if I had to speculate, I would suggest that it would have been earlier than the 1970s, for Barthes’s friendship with Jean-Pierre Richard (the original editor of

The Afterlives of Roland Barthes 60 this punctum therefore has roots beyond cinema and the photographic image – in Barthes’s reading of Winnicott. Pursuing this point further would require another chapter (one not focussed on mourning, film and photography). 36 CL, 60. For a fine discussion of Camera Lucida’s palinodic structure, see Jean-Claude Milner, Le Pas philosophique de Roland Barthes (Lagrasse: Éditions Verdier, 2003), 69–70. The publication in 2007 of the teaching notes from the ‘discours amoureux’ seminar of 1974–6 revealed that Barthes had been aware of the phenomenon of the palinode some years before the writing of Camera Lucida; see the session dated 8 January 1976 (DA, 319–44), where the roots in Plato are explored. 37 Jean Narboni calls Time ‘the principal character’ in Camera Lucida (La Nuit sera noire et blanche, 58). 38 Barthes’s French (JD, 184; OC V, 828) features ‘quelque chose’ in each case.

37 Jean Narboni calls Time ‘the principal character’ in Camera Lucida (La Nuit sera noire et blanche, 58). 38 Barthes’s French (JD, 184; OC V, 828) features ‘quelque chose’ in each case. 39 CL, 51. Derek Attridge points out (‘Obtuse, Sharp Meaning’, 79) that this moment echoes a phrase in the earlier essay on the Eisenstein stills: ‘we cannot describe the obtuse meaning’ (RF, 55). 40 CL, 115–16. Translation modified. I have inserted Barthes’s French (OC V, 882) to show that the linguistic echoes of the journal mark his original phrasing. 41 He did, however, mention the same strange scene from Casanova during the session of The Preparation of the Novel which took place on 10 March 1979 (PN, 106) – a date which was towards the end of the period covered by the Mourning Diary, but just before the beginning of the writing of Camera Lucida on 15 April. This latter fact makes Barthes’s introduction of the Fellini reference in The

1996: 148). My main focus in the current chapter, though, will be on issues of signification or meaning construction, as well as on related issues of taste and cultural value (which are more closely associated with and more explicitly addressed by a critical, cultural studies perspective on media and communica- tions in modern society). I begin and end here by referring to the work of Roland Barthes (see especially Barthes 1973; 1984), starting with an account of his influential, but ultimately flawed, analysis of French popular cultural images in the 1950s and 1960s, and finishing with a discussion of some personal reflec- tions that he offers much later on the medium of photography. In between these sections, my commentary charts a series of conceptual developments in ‘social-semiotic theory’ that serve to draw our attention to different dimensions of signification, textuality and soci…

of his simply liking them to the point where he loved them, Barthes identi- ﬁed what he called the punctum. He explained that the punctum, which is not coded, is distinct from the studium, which is coded. This uncoded detail, he explained, has the power of expansion and enhancement, which is often metonymic: ‘I feel that its mere presence changes my reading, that I am looking at a new photograph, marked in my eyes with a higher value’ (Barthes 1988: 42). Barthes identiﬁed his own ‘madness’ in the ambiguous relationship between perception and time in photography: 1111 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 20111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 30111 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 40111 1 2 3 44111 SEEING AMBIGUITY 78

particular situations that it promises to illuminate. That such linkages seem far more compelling when played out through interpretation of photo-journalistic and documentary photographs is telling. There is a significant Barthesian theme running through Azoulay’s philosophy of photography. One can read The Civil Contract of Photography, in part, as an attempt to socialize the modes of intersubjectivity that structure, but remain implicit in, Barthes’s singular metaphysics of photographic affect. In one passage, she picks up on the ‘other’ unpublished image that structures Camera Lucida (upon which few com- mentators remark), the image of Jerome, Napoleon’s cousin, which Barthes tells us sparked his desire to find out what photography is. Few tend to question the affective relationship he claims for the more celebrated ‘Winter Garden’ photograph of his mother as a child, whether or not they agree with Barthes’s theses on

that explains its meaning. Roland Barthes also sees photography as having its own linguistic powers. However, like Berger he moves towards philosophy away from process, Berger being concerned with ‘learned assumptions’ about reality and Barthes, the moving but inadvertent aspects of reality he called ‘punctum’. Enyeart feels that unlike their work, Shore’s is not judgemental. Enyeart states that Shore’s approach is closest to Szarkowski’s in that both divide photography into separate sections for critical analysis to the extent that they even have two sections, time and frame, that are the same. They differ in that Shore concentrates on the photograph and Szarkowski on the photographer. Shore’s book is divided into four areas, two deal with the physical construction of Szarkowski, The Photographer’s Eye and Shore, The Nature of Photographs CHAPTER 2 21

Barthes does not straightforwardly reject the sentimental. A Lover’s Discourse is not only, and perhaps not primarily, a critique of the itera- tion of lover’s discourses. Instead it is, in part, a defence of amorous, sentimental addresses. Barthes attempts throughout his writings to chal- lenges the doxas, the conventions, of society and of thought. A Lover’s Discourse challenges antithetical doxas: the orthodox romanticised beliefs about love, but also the denigration of these beliefs as trite, senti- mental and delusional. Barthes’ book responds to both the valorisation of love and the deprecation of love. He reveals the cultural fabrication of love undermining the mythical naturalisation of love but equally he elab- orates and expands love’s texts contesting the critique of love and its pleasures. While love is on the one hand valorised it has also been dismissed as a delusion, a restriction of freedom, and a distraction from more urgent

the more pronounced, “je vois, je sense, donc je remarque, je regarde et je pense” (La chambre claire 42). Seeing and feeling, for Barthes, are the preconditions for thinking and being. If being is contingent on seeing, then by corollary photography offers lessons on nonbeing and on death. From this premise, Barthes reads death—his mother’s, his own, others—photographically. In a rhetorical flash, in a caption, he most succinctly captures the unsettling relations he finds among life and death, the photographic image, and the language we use to make sense of them. Under a portrait of a handcuffed Lewis Payne (later executed for attempting to assassinate William H. Seward), Barthes writes: “He is dead and he is going to die…” (Camera Lucida 95). Barthes’s words are striking for their implication as well as for their form. First, the italics propose an emphasis that their consist…

of the writerly lover’s discourse, one of those proclamations that we would expect from Barthes as part of his effort to “discourage the temptation to meaning.” Hence Solomon invokes Barthes’s own “impersonal,” “lexical” mode of writing in order to show (discursively) how love and desire are acutely personal despite Barthes’s semiological claims to the contrary. By contrast, Nancy Holland offers an account of Jacques Derrida’s discourses of desire across the thirty years of his highly productive career. She shows that at least two different discourses of desire are at work in Derrida’s writings. The first, “male” discourse is discussed in the context of three essays in Writing and Difference (1967); the second, “female” discourse is discussed in the context of Cinders (1980) and Memoirs of the Blind (1990). The conclusion drawn from these texts is that while the “male” disco…

image (be it acoustic or visual) as an object for one’s consciousness (thus making the disposition a highly correlational one). However, in the way Keathley analyses the language of the cinephilic anecdote, it becomes clear that it is also a disposition in which, while one attends to a detail, one is equally seized by it. Indeed, Keathley compares the cinephilic moment to Roland Barthes’s punctum developed in Camera Lucida (2000: 26–­7). The cine- philic moment thus involves an abdication of will and is inexplicable in terms of representation, or traditional systems of consideration. In many ways, it compares with LaBelle’s dual operation of unfolding and enfolding that he identifies in the acoustic that I explored in Chapter 3. The cinephilic moment, as a disposition of being in the world, is a kind of leaning into the world –­ a disposition reaching beyond its surface, seeing or hearing in excess of it –­

most effective ways of doing so is to pay close attention to the affective detail of the still image that makes up the moving one, in order to develop the punc- tum’s metonymic powers of expansion.13 More than this, though, there is now compelling evidence that Barthes was disingenuous in his division of the punctum from cinema in Camera Lucida. There is a body of work that demonstrates the origin of his idea of the punc- tum in his close analysis of stills from the films of Sergei Eisenstein in ‘The Third Meaning’ and his tentative development there of the idea of an obtuse meaning in images.14 In that essay, Barthes acknowledges his ‘taste for stills’

of himself in A Lover’s Discourse (1977) in which the grammar of French in the original adroitly keeps the sexual orientation of the protagonist ambiguous (as does the language of Auden’s love poetry). And Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes (1975), an autobiography, begins by announcing in an epigraph that ‘All of this must be thought of as being said by a character in a novel’ [‘Tout ceci doit être consideré comme dit par un personnage de roman’]. So there are two voices in the book, Barthes’s ‘own’ (or that of the author) which we might infer, and that of Barthes as a ﬁctional character. Barthes also reviewed his own book: this time with a reviewer persona. Such deconstructions of the moral unity of the subject, and the (classically liberal) desire to help the self to evade some of the repressive ideological boundaries it encounters, are very different things. Indeed, the justiﬁcation fo…

expresses this indirection. Irigaray’s reformulation is read alongside Sally Potter’s ﬁlm Orlando enabling an exploration of the differing represen- tations of sexual difference in Irigaray and Potter and also enabling a comparison of Orlando and Shelmerdine’s love relation with Irigaray’s love as indirection. Chapter 7 turns to the work of Roland Barthes, summarising his the- ories of textual interpretation – his theories of myth and code – as a basis for understanding his reﬂections on lover’s discourses. Despite the antipathy to the sentimentality of love, Barthes creates a pastiche of frag- ments from the representations and analyses of love with Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther a constant refrain but many others – Sartre, Plato, Freud, Nietzsche, Sade, Sappho – also contributing to these recol- lections and reﬂections.

exists. Symbolically speaking, Calvino alludes to the idea that it is quite impossible to read a text without being influenced by others' interpretations and contributions to the meanings that exist in it, including the author's categorization. The Reader and the actual reader reach the realization that everything has to be defined and categorized. Apparently, from Calvino's point of view, the reader who forces his or her personal feelings, experiences, and ideologies on a text epitomizes Barthes' understanding of the proper role of readers. In describing the conversation between "you" and another reader, Markey says in Italo Calvino: In this scene, "you," in one last mighty effort to locate the Calvino book, goes to the library. There he becomes involved in an unconventional conversation with other readers about the art and the meaning of reading. Before long it is clear to the reader outside the novel that the ensuing dialogue is a pretext for the writer to

of Barthes’ Mourning Diaries in 2009 provides further proof, laid out in exemplary fashion by Neil Badmington (2012), that Barthes was first pricked by the punctum in the cinema, on trips to watch William Wyler’s The Little Foxes, Christian Gion’s One Two Two and Hitchcock’s Under Capricorn. The origins of Barthes’ idea of the punctum therefore lie in cinema, confirming the authenticity and validity of a film critical practice that pays metonymic attention to the detail. III Veering from Borges I began this book by departing from Proust; I want to end it by veering from Borges.

Barthes wrote on pieces of “quartered typing paper” beginning the day after his mother’s death in 1977 (Howard 261). This personal (and now public) diary helps to clarify some of Barthes’s late sensibilities. Richard Howard, Barthes’s primary English translator, describes Mourning Diary as a set of “crucial and painful notations” that can be read as “the com- panion to the ultimate writings of Roland Barthes” (261). Across these last works, Barthes seems to write to the scale of the quarter-page. In this Diary and in the book project he calls “Photo-Maman,” Barthes com- poses in short flashes, captions, and aphorisms (Mourning Diary 136). Barthes, among theorists, is characteristically attuned to the material and the sensual—perhaps most notably in The Pleasure of the Text— and in Camera Lucida, he details the many material touches upon which photography relies, the shutter click…

like the Camera Lucida, an early drawing aid that made use of a prism. To describe photography from the eye’s viewpoint Barthes quotes Blanchot ‘. . . ‘‘the essence of the image is to be altogether outside, without intimacy, and yet more . . . mysterious than the thought of the inner-most being; without signification, yet summoning up the depth of any possible meaning . . .’’ ’ (p. 106). It is the power of the photograph as evidence that prevents it from being penetrated. Barthes quotes Sartre as saying that the object yields itself fully in the image. 45. The ‘air’ A photograph of an object deals only with reality and authenticates its existence. A photograph of a face ‘authenticates the existence of a certain being’ and this is more problematic, in particular in the case of a loved one, as Barthes wants to Roland Barthes, Camera Lucida CHAPTER 4 97

The texts that make up Roland Barthes's oeuvre resist any summarizing gesture. Continually shift­ ing between methodologies, theoretical vocabul­ aries, and writing styles, Barthes's texts are themselves vehicles for elaborating and testing the connections between his chief preoccupations: history, textuality, and pleasure. Barthes's first major work, Writing Degree Zero (1 953), is a defense of linguistic and stylistic experimentation. A response to Jean-Paul Sartre's VV!zat is Literature? ( 1 94 7), in which Sartre suggests that in order to write politically one should use a plain style and language, Writing Degree Zero details a theoretical framework which combines avant-garde aesthetics with revolutionary politics: experimenta­ tion itself is recognized as political. Barthes makes a distinction between "language," the set of combi­ natory possibilities shared by the speakers of a language; "style," a subject's private vocabulary

lectoral, in Roland Barthes sense, is the vector of attention, we might insist, even in works he once called illisible (Stewart 2007: 68-70), by which he was referring to the teasing phantom alphabets mastered by Michaux or Saul Steinberg (or even, one finds, Picasso) that Barthes himself also experimented with. But by the notion of lectorship I woidd mean, more broadly, those various instances, sculptural as well as lexigraphic, in which the shape of textual mediation, depurposed and turned (inward) upon itself, transmediates its own former (or still latent) verbal purport into a different tropological system. This is where meaning still borrows from the literary (and its wordplay) in Between Print Matter and Page Matter 67 the absence of script or grammar, making even spewed polymer art silently articulate by way of retinal metaphor. To reiterate my opening sense of the place of all such verbally demediated conceptual works in

Bal that he describes, modifies, criticizes, circumscribes, and specifies along the pages of the essay until the word only indicates the one experience of Roland Barthes before his mother's death. Along the way Barthes evokes the picture of Marcel's grandmother but to the involuntary memory that he compares the tuche, the happening of this-has-been of the winter garden photo. Strangely, while writing on photography he missed the closeted gaze as the most typical photographic specificity in Proust's writing. One has not finished being astounded before photography, that glass eye that slides in front of the eye of the "operator" (Barthes's term) that is Saint-Loup in the anecdote of the picture-tak- ing. But the narrator is the real photographer all through his writing. What photography allows him to inscribe, to fix like writing, is an essentially fugitive vision that is at the same time purely

previous generation shaped by traumatic events that can be neither understood nor recreated.1 As ‘visual narratives’ and ‘prose pictures,’ family photos, reveal concealed and unacknowledged relations between the viewers and the photography.2 Based on Roland Barthes’ theories of photos, Hirsh aims to look for the relationships beyond the familial pictures that compose one’s post-memory. By adopting Hirsh’s idea of post-memory, I intend to go back to Barthes’ ideas of ‘stadium’ and ‘punctum’ in Camera Lucida, and investigate two notions of the spectators’ post-memory in Maus: one is represented through the narrator, Artie, who has a direct relationship with the pictures he presents, and the other is the readers of Maus that perceive the memory indirectly through the narrator.

desire that itself crosses into mourning for a lost body, drives the last work published in Barthes's own lifetime. Barthes visited not the archive materials of the Bastille (as did Foucault, in a similar queer historical impulse that I discuss in chapter 2) but the photographic archive of his own family in Camera Lucida. This last work is queer in a number of respects: it insists on the achieved somatic relation between bodies enabled by the technology ofphotography, thus find- ing the fulfillment of queer historical desire that impelled Barthes through his whole career; it abandons (oddly, queerly, according to some critics) the deconstruction of the subject that earlier enabled his queer history, operating instead according to phenomenologi- cal precepts; and it is driven by a desire to recover again his lost, dead mother, which relation itself might be marked as gay, queer!65 What in…

I am grateful to Seán Burke for reminding me of how important this little- read book is to our understanding of Barthes’s relation to the author. 13. Plurality and perversion connect in Barthes via the Freudian notion of polymorphous perverse sexuality, which contrasts with the “unity” of normative adult sexuality. 14. These “bursts of memory” may have some connection with Proust’s sense of memory; it is a bit later in this same (very long) sentence that Proust shows up. 15. This penultimate paragraph of the preface to Sade, Fourier, Loyola is composed of five sentences. The first is a short, simple sentence, and then each succeeding sentence is considerably longer than the one be- fore it. 16. This negative sense of “destiny” is found in Barthes’s work as early as

voice, which turns Barthes’s relation to it into one of desire. One must be careful, however, not to dismiss this relation as simply subjective: because the X is the cause of desire and not its consequence, we cannot claim that Barthes imposes something of himself onto the voice. He merely “set[s] up a new scheme of evaluation which … certainly … is individual.” Thus do relations of desire preserve particularity, difference, by supposing, via the grain of the voice, a private beyond, a being that does not surrender itself in speech. When desire gives way to drive, this private beyond no longer remains hidden. What’s involved in the drive, Lacan tells us, is a making oneself heard or making oneself seen; that is to say, the intimate core of our being, no longer sheltered by sense, ceases to be supposed and suddenly becomes exposed. It thrusts itself forward, pushing through the surface of…

p. 41. Schor's book provides a valuable reflection on the importance of the detail in the creation of modern aesthetics. Roland Barthes' celebrated "effet de reel"-the inclusion of thematically su- perfluous details to "make real" the world described-offers one way to think about Flaubertian detail. But as a number of critics have shown, often using Barthes' own example of the barometer in Madame Aubain's house in Un coeur simple, details can always be thematically rationalized in some perspective of reading. What interests me is less the apparent thematic irrelevance of certain details than their lack of cohesion into a whole. On Barthes' project, rethought in historical perspective, see Schor's fine discussion in Reading in Detail, chap. 5. 7.

the details: “the trigger of the lens… the metallic shifting of the plates… I love these mechanical sounds in an almost voluptuous way… their abrupt click breaking through the mortiferous [mortifère] layer of the Pose” (Camera Lucida 15). The camera’s click breaks through the lived continuum, seeming to reanimate the stillness of a pose; and here lies the strange pleasure of mechanical execution. In reflecting on Barthes’s own photographic reflections, Derrida comes to adopt his late friend’s terms as well as his characteristic late style. Derrida had also addressed life and death elsewhere—notably in “De- meure,” his accompaniment to Maurice Blanchot’s “The Instant of My Death”—but here he commits to a different, borrowed method, that is, to reading and writing with Barthes in “approval, solidarity, and gratitude” (“Deaths” 56). He even feels that “a certain mimetism is… a dut…

Earlier, in his "Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives," the image of this space is more abstract. To combat the systematic confusion of narrative consecution and consequence requires disclosing "an atemporallogic lying behind the temporality of narrative" (98).

Words such as 'plaisir' and 'fascination' give a picture of his relationship with images that is in some ways different from some of his claims in the text itself. On the first page of the text proper he claims: Il supporte mal toute image de lui-même, souffre d'être nommé. Il considère que la perfection d'un rapport humain tient à cette vacance de l'image: abolir entre soi, de l'un à l'autre, les adjectifs; un rapport qui s'adjective est du côté de l'image, du côté de la domination, de la mort.

biography (Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes (1975)), love (A Lover’s Discourse: Fragments (1977)) and photography (Camera Lucida: Reﬂections on Photography (1980)). This move closer to bodily desires, images and processes was signalled in diverse places, as being an attempt to write a ‘degree zero’ criticism, for example, the fragments on Bataille’s ‘The Big Toe’ arbitrarily placed into alphabetical order in the essay ‘Outcomes of the Text’, which denies linkages and connections bet- ween the fragments precisely to mark them as non-progressive textual outcomes. Readers have generally agreed that there is a more elegiac quality to some of Barthes’ ﬁnal writings, especially his work on photography, although his lifelong attempt to exceed any particular theoretical position has always included an intense appreciation of the past.

Indeed, this privileging dissolves the rich indeterminacy hinted at in Barthes's essay. This indetermi- nacy is akin to that inherent in the simultaneous experience of one's subjecthood and objecthood in perfor- mance art. Barthes's preliminary conclusion that space and time form an "illogical conjunction" on photog- raphy's denotative level of meaning hints at the possibility of the photograph's eliciting a conceptual balancing act, prompting viewers to attend to both the spatial and the temporal aspects of photography. Such different concerns, indeed, operat…

obtuse meanings because ‘they lack the diegetic [narrative] horizon’ that obtuse meanings subvert, he unduly limited the application of the concept. In Camera Lucida (1980), he identified two elements in the photograph, studium (the culturally coded) and punctum (what, unpredictably and idiosyncratically rises up to pierce the viewer), the one obvious, the other obtuse. Moreover, in 1970 Barthes spoke of an ‘autonomous art’ in which ‘anecdotalized images and obtuse meanings are placed in a diegetic space’. Roland Barthes 17

of voices’ coming from elsewhere with a distinct and recognizable style.68 The individual ‘I’ is markedly present in Dillon’s essayism, but this ‘I’ is formed through relations of affinity with several others, perhaps no one more clearly than Roland Barthes. In ‘RB and Me: An Education’ (2010), an essay in which Dillon reflects on the ways in which Barthes has had a formative effect on him, Dillon identifies what he sees as Barthes’s central idea: ‘much, possibly all, of what we imagine to inhere in Nature is in fact a veiled emanation of Culture’.69 This insight permeates Barthes’s writing, such as, for example, A Lover’s Discourse: Fragments (Fragments d’un discours amoureux), an essayistic text in which Barthes shows how the language of love – of that which is deeply intimate and deeply felt – is always already and inevitably the language of culture and tradition. In a book full of quotations (‘pieces of various origin have been “put together”’, says Barthes70) and

act of close reading in the context of Roland Barthes’ theory of the punctum, to which no doubt Derrida’s thought on this topic is indebted. In ‘The Deaths of Roland Barthes’, Derrida acknowledges that ‘this interest in the detail was also his’ (DRB 268), that ‘the word punctum [ . . . ] translates, in Camera Lucida, one meaning of the word “detail”: a point of singularity’ (DRB 269), and that ‘as the place of irreplaceable singularity and of the unique referential, the punctum irradiates and, what is most surprising, lends itself to metonymy’ (DRB 288). For Derrida, the punctum’s relation to metonymy is not acciden- tal but essential; metonymy constitutes the punctum’s force, ‘its dynamis, in other words, its power, potentiality, virtuality, and even its dissimulation, its

Mille Images de Jérémie fonctionne comme un tableau impressionniste : plus le narrateur se rapproche de Jérémie, plus il donne libre cours à la précision obsessionnelle de sa mémoire, et moins l’on a l’impression de pouvoir se faire un portrait cohérent de l’homme qu’il décrit. C’est là tout l’intérêt de ce roman volontairement fuyant, qui réussit à être à la fois un très beau texte sur les fantasmes que l’on projette sur les autres et un témoignage déchirant de la solitude de nos monologues intérieurs. Le narrateur, bien que doué pour décrire le monde qui l’entoure, est accablé par la conscience qu’il ne pourra jamais parfaitement…

They engage a mode of corporeal being: “Hence, in this anarchic foam of tastes and distastes, a kind of list- less blur gradually appears in the ﬁ gure of a bodily enigma, requir- ing complicity or irritation.” Because we know that Schumann was Barthes’s favorite composer, his absence from Barthes’s list indi- cates that he exceeded any affi rmation of taste. Schumann engaged something beyond pleasure, and even beyond jouissance . His music could fulﬁ ll Barthes by allowing his entire body to identify with its rhythms and harmonies. Schumann would be found missing from any bouquet of Barthes’s tastes because he is the quintessence of music, which is to say that, for Barthes, he was the quintessence of life as music.

Barthes meant it about power. His essays were essais in Montaigne’s original sense, tentative, trials of ideas. In his last decade even these came to seem too domineering, too insistently coherent, too “classical”; better to relax, to group paragraphs under topic headings, in alphabetical order, open to the aleatory air. Thus The Pleasure of the Text, Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes, A Lover’s Discourse. They slide from under the essay’s assertive form—thesis, argument, conclusion—into something more wavering, more faithful to the moods of thought—his thought—how it’s always escaping, from reader, from writer, yet can’t escape its paradoxical consistency, its message, its loyalty to the values of a lifetime. The older you get, the more everything you write and do connects, yes, into a self. What Keats, who didn’t get old, called soul-making. “All this must be considered as if spoken by …

visual—unfortunately, our only word for it is the image—calls into be- ing by suggestion and by a kind of contamination. We don’t write about these things, it is not a metaphorical representation that the sen- sory pretext summons but rather something related by affinity, that prolongs the content of the object in another, more tenuous form, as though to prolong a last touch with the very fingertips (SV 2–3). This is emphatically not academic prose as usual; if it were, for one thing, a much shorter excerpt would have sufficed to communicate its point. But the point here is that there is no (single) “point,” though the passage at first seems on its way to making one (something about Barthes’s notion of reading); rather, by the time we come to “that adult and superstitious power,” the dumb animals wondering at hu- man abilities they can only dream of, while the humans for their part idealize the animal sensuality from which they feel cut off, we are clearly reading a prose con-

dab de Maurice Blanchot est d’une lecture qui suppose que ce monde à l’envers fasse reconnaître le monde à l’endroit; l’antimimétisme n’exclut pas l’objectivisme – cela se sait du nouveau roman; la plus grande récusation du mimétisme n’interdit pas que l’œuvre littéraire soit encore caractérisée comme un objet visuel, ainsi que cela est manifeste chez Barthes et chez d’autres. Ces notations ne doivent pas se confondre avec le constat que des œuvres mêlent explicitement les deux – ainsi des œuvres du réalisme magi- que, ainsi des œuvres du récit poétique. Ce serait là marquer seulement que des œuvres exposent les deux caractéristiques, sans que l’on aille plus loin pour interpréter à la fois la discrimination d’une mimesis et d’une antimime- sis et leur alliance, dès lors que l’on a noté que le partage de l’une et de l’autre n’est pas absolu.

the end of his classic essay on ‘‘Subjectivity in Language,’’ where he writes that it is ‘‘the condition of intersubjectivity which alone makes linguistic communication possible.’’≤∏ Barthes clearly has Benveniste in mind as well. Consider Benveniste’s equally famous essay on ‘‘The Nature of Pronouns,’’ where he writes that ‘‘these ‘pronominal’ forms do not refer to ‘reality’ or to ‘objective’ positions in space or time but to the utterance, unique each time, that contains them. . . . I . . . can be assumed by each speaker on the condition that he refers each time only to the instance of his own discourse.’’≤π This particular form of abstrac- tion of the ﬁrst person can be found regularly in Barthes’s writing as in certain other literary work. Along with ‘‘The Death of the Author,’’ the sections from Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes titled ‘‘Le Shifter comme utopie’’ (‘‘The Shifter as Utopia’’) and ‘‘Moi, je’’ (‘‘Myself, I’’) would be

status as an author in the romantic sense.” PP: Did this not follow a conversation with Lacan? PhLL: No. I don’t even know if they ever met. He read him, of course, and very perceptively in my view. PP: Let’s delve further into the necessity of this question about Narcissus: it involves a questioning of the image and the mirror, which can be said to represent this very peculiar perception of what takes place at that moment. Blanchot therefore returns to Narcissus in a very illuminating fashion, for the Narcissus he describes practically recalls the figure of the autistic [la figure de l’autiste]. In Ovid, as Blanchot explains, Narcissus doesn’t speak, doesn’t let others touch him, doesn’t know himself: he doesn’t allow others to approach him, he has no relationship with the outside world and no relationship with speech since the only words he hears are the repetition of the last word he uttered. That on which Blanchot insists here is that Narcissus doesn’t know

quetry Without End” opens the dialogue of ﬂ irtations by offering a series of theses drawn from Simmel’s classic essay, at once making explicit Simmel’s borrowing from the philosophical tradition (Aris- totle, Kant) and putting Simmel into dialogue with twentieth- century thinkers (Freud, Heidegger, Adorno, Barthes, and Luhmann). Flem- ing’s paper addresses ﬂ irtation in Simmel as a gestural mode, to be distinguished from the explicit discursivity of love as discussed by Barthes or Luhmann. Hoffman- Schwartz’s response, “The Double Sense of the ‘With’: Rethinking Relation after Simmel,” ﬁ rst probes the ambiguous semantics of “ﬂ irting with” (kokettieren mit) and then pursues Simmel’s reference to Plato’s Symposium, posing the ques- tion, in light of Plato’s famous linking of love and philosophy, of what the move from love to ﬂ irtation means for thought itself. Moving back to t…

ness, they lack any punctum, all semiotic intensity’,31 and according to Barthes, cinematic images possess no punctum. The punctum connects with contemplative lingering: ‘in front of the screen, I am not free to shut my eyes; otherwise, opening them again, I would not discover the same image’. The punctum discloses itself only to gazing that lingers in con­ templation. In contrast, a sequence of images forces the observer, as Barthes puts it, to ‘continuous voracity’. The punctum eludes the con­ suming, ravenous gaze in which no ‘pensiveness’ dwells.32 Moving to the chapter ‘The Society of Information’, Han comes to reflect on Plato’s allegory of the cave. He claims, in contrast to Badiou, that Plato’s cave is ‘constructed as a theater’. He writes: ‘Plato’s cave presents a kind of shadow theater, then. The objects that cast shadow are not the real things of the world: they are, one and all, theatrical fig­

as the container of meaning but as a space in which a potentially vast number of relations coalesce. A site of words and sentences shadowed by multiple potentialities of meaning, the literary work can now only be understood in a comparative way, the reader moving outwards from the work’s apparent structure into the relations it possesses with other works and other linguistic struc- tures. Comparison is, perhaps, the wrong word here, since we are talking not so much of the placing of one work in relation to others as of the registering of the relational position of signs and works within systems of meaning. Perhaps the most famous expression of such a view of the literary work, now called a text, comes in Roland Barthes’s essay of 1968, ‘The Death of the Author’. The title of this short essay articulates neatly what the emergence of the concept of intertextuality fre- quently does to the …

than it is a condition of knowledge. Moving beneath its clothes, the body of fl esh offers itself as pieces of a whole that can be perceived fi rst by the sense of sight, then perhaps by touch, and fi nally by the mind. In Barthes’s formulation, the body in its entirety is all that we would ever want to know, and intermittence is the name he gives to the way that body is revealed and occluded by it own unavoidable textuality, by its appearance fi rst as a material reality and its subsequent disappearance into unknowable other. Eroticism, in turn, names the pleasure of moving between – between the seen and unseen, the known and unknown, of course, but also between the language of fl esh, with its infi nite vocabulary and complex narratives, and the fl esh of language, with its features no less warm and palpable for being wrought from consonant and vowel. Barthes reads each in…

own linguistic and literary production. The textual mirror was turned inward anti activated, as Roland Barthes explained: bien loin d'être une copie analogique du réel, la littérature est au contraire la conscience même de l'irréel du langage: la littérature la plus "vraie," c'est celle qui se sait la plus irréelle, dans la mesure où elle se sait essentiellement langage, c'est cette recherche d'un état intermédiaire aux choses et aux mots, c'est cette tension d'une conscience qui est à la fois portée et limitée par les mots, qui dispose à travers eux d'un pouvoir à la fois absolu et improbable. Le réalisme, ici, ce ne peut donc être la copie des choses, mais la connaissance du langage; l'oeuvre la plus "réaliste" ne sera pas celle qui "peint" la réalité, mais qui, se servant du monde comme contenu . . . explorera le plus profondément possible la réalité irréelle du langag…

I refer specifically here to the opening of his essay, "postcolonial Authority and Postmodern Guilt"; it fea- tures a passage from The Pleasure ofthe Text wherein Roland Barthes writes that he is sitting in a bar in Tangiers while listening and at- tempting" 'to enumerate the stereophony of [sic] languages within earshot.'" Bhabha writes appreciatively of the discontinuities and fragments that displace the "hierarchy and the subordinations of the sentence" as Barthes enacts "the affective language of cultural dif- ference." Here is Barthes, quoted by Bhabha: " 'Through me passed words, tiny syntagms, bits of formulae and no sentence formed . .. It set up in me a definitive discontinuity: this non-sentence was in no way something that could not have acceded to the sentence, that might have been before the sentence: it was: outside the sentence.'

political qualities of this mutual constitution. In fact, Barthes’s and Maso’s visions of literature are particularly close, as both think that, in a metonymic way, texts imply the presence of a body. Just as the room, the listener, and the performer are part of the instrument when someone plays music, the reader, in communion with the text, enables the activation of the system that animates it. Barthes and Maso consider the relationship to the text as a sen- sual dialogue, emphasizing “notions of language as heat and light, motion and stillness, a vibrant living thing capable of containing great emotion. Also fluid, shifting, elusive, fugitive, and darkness keep taking back. Bodies which make fragile amorphous, beautiful shapes for a moment and then are gone” (Maso Rain Taxi). Maso’s novel presents such a fluid and vibrant lan- guage in her depiction of the thoughts of Ava Klein, a comparative literature

Erotic Etudes | 19 and culture, for example. Here, a focus on the politics of negation seems to eclipse the pleasurable, when they are in fact inseparable for Barthes. In this context, what is particularly relevant to this study is The Pleasure of the Text, A Lover’s Discourse: Fragments, and Camera Lucida’s emphasis on a loss of self, which relates to the erotic experience and to the political poten- tial of jouissance. Barthes’s late work enables a clarification of the positive aesthetic of formally innovative texts that have so far been confined to a primarily negative rhetoric. The loss of self that Barthes theorizes allows us to understand the erotic fusion of text and reader, a fusion that allows a mutual constitution of reader and open text. The authors of Plus, AVA, DICTEE, and VAS exploit the erotic and political qualities of this mutual constitution. In fact, Barthes’s and Maso’s visions of literature are particularly close, as both think that, in a metonymic

of the sun as the ever-present witness, to be seen by it. Giving face and dress to the sun and its agents is to invest the universe with sentient and potentially responsive forces, an auratic veiling which Benjamin also ﬁ nds in the recurring prosopopoeias of Baudelaire’s poetry. Against the background of interludes, the soliloquies give us voices speaking to themselves or overheard, possibly witnessed by and even addressed to the sun. The soliloquies are vocative; they draw attention to voice, to the modality of address – in this, as we have said, resides much of their embarrassment; the embarrassment of the high style. Strangely, they assert the temporality of the pure present against the ‘said’ of the recording instance and the past tense of the interludes; they soliloquise on writing, they speak in quotations, they invoke the muse. Jonathan Culler writes of the apostrophe…

graphic medium. Martin’s organ is his finger pressing the trigger. The clicking sound of the trigger is the very thing to which his desire clings: “an abrupt click breaking through the mortiferous layers of the pose.”34 With his finger on the trigger, Martin inhabits the world like the body of the mother of omnipotent ascendancy. It is on his fingertip, the skin of his finger as the space of the interface with the skin of the mother of infancy, or rather in the space of contact between the clicking trigger and his index, that the mother is kept alive, in-corporated. In Camera Lucida, Barthes describes two ways of being in the world. Space can be visitable or habitable. Visitable space is incidental and acci- dental. Habitable space on the other hand is where one is sure to have been or to go. “This longing to inhabit is fantasmatic, deriving from a kind of second sight which se…

A pervasive narrative logic is here embedded. Like all embodied char- acters in this text, Mile. Vinteuil must take on accusative form if her onlooker, Marcel, is to assume nominative (better would be "pronomina- tive") form. She must be visible and self-divided object to his invisible and self-cohered subject. More, it is precisely scenes like this one that establish Marcel's coherence and authority as subject/narrator. His achieved know- ing requires a scrupulously unnarrated temporal continuum, just as her self-fissured unknowing must be situated within a narrated, revelatory moment.

felt – is always already and inevitably the language of culture and tradition. In a book full of quotations (‘pieces of various origin have been “put together”’, says Barthes70) and communal figures of language (‘absence’, ‘adorable’, ‘affirmation’, ‘alteration’, ‘anxiety’, just to name a few), Barthes suggests that our experience of love happens through our immersion in language; that is, what we have ‘read, spoken, heard’.71 ‘To try to write love’, we read, ‘is to confront the muck of language.’72 Barthes’s work – A Lover’s Discourse but also other texts that are personal while questioning the assumptions of autobiography, such as Camera Lucida and Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes – is, to use Adam Phillips’s words, a ‘celebration of lan- guage as possibility’, language as that which can allow ‘life stories’ to be told.73 But this possibility is to be understood in the context that these are ‘text[s] with uncertain

into its depths the emotion aroused by sensuous beauty, and simultaneously renounces physical gratification of that beauty. We are tempted to say that this same concep­ tion is to be found in the works of Paul Claudel. But that would certainly be anticipating. We must once more look at the speech which Phaedrus has read aloud to Socrates under the noonday shade of the plane tree by the Ilissus. The three factors we have men­ tioned (the tacit but unequivocal aim of sensual pleasure; the deprecation of passio; the elevation of incapacity for emotion and devotion to "prudence," "good sense," "vir­ tue") constitute the sustaining idea, the true content of the speech. But the speechmaker is highly "cultivated," and he therefore, while expositing these basic ideas, cannot help introducing a good deal that is true and correct, or at least significant and highly suggestive. His tale…

ROLAND BARTHES (1915–80) FRENCH LITERARY AND CULTURAL CRITIC In the summer of 1986 at the Pavilion des Arts in Paris, there was an exhibition of excerpts from Roland Barthes’s essays on visual images. His words were printed on plaques large enough to be read from several feet away and were accompanied by the images about which he wrote. The exhibition, ‘Le Texte et l’image’, not only made the point that images are inextricably bound up with words, it also comprised an anthology of this and other of Barthes’s ideas about visual art. Curated by a professor of philosophy, ‘Le Text et l’image’ was itself a work of philosophy whose message was twofold: written words are material objects, and visual images are themselves a kind of writing, inscriptions of intelligibility engraved on the space of the world. The images Barthes wrote about were those through which this double message, and his ideas of art in general, were able most clearly to be articulated. These ideas, however,

The Perverse Art of Reading 26 Following this deliberate staging of his own imaginary came Frag- ments d’un discours amoureux (1977) (A Lover’s Discourse: Frag- ments), which as the title suggests gives the floor over to the imagi- nary of the lover (in this case Barthes himself) who is no longer taken seriously by the doxa. Imagination also plays a central role in his final book, La Chambre claire (Camera Lucida), published in 1980. This short book not only pays homage to photography and the memory of his deceased mother, but also explicitly to Sartre’s L’imaginaire. In the meantime Barthes had been appointed professor of lit- erary semiology in 1977 at the Collège de France. As we have seen, in his inaugural speech he pushed the fantasy to the fore as core con- cept of his research. The notion of the fantasy made it possible for him to bind together the imaginary, the body and the act of reading. While

Barthes’s and Kristeva’s works on the sensual uses of language are close, but here Barthes insists on the playful uses of linguistic processes, which can be compared to sexual foreplay, while Kristeva locates the sexual origins of the Semiotic in repressed libidinal drives.

erations. In his Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes , he had noticed in his family photos the recurrence of a certain pensive position of the elbow, one that seemed passed down from father to father. No doubt Barthes thought about the bequeathing of hand positions as he played, looking at his grandmother’s ﬁ ngerings on the score. Such markings do not so much resemble signs as they do traces. They put the current player into a nostalgic relation to time and call upon his imagination of signs: An earlier player had been pres- ent in front of this score, and Barthes experiences with his hands the absence and presence of his grandmother. In his Camera Lu- cida , he captured the noeme of photography with the phrase ça a été , that has been : a relation to time presupposed by any printed image. In keeping with Sartre, he observed the paradox in which the imagination can make an object present without our being able

of having transformed its spectacles and pleasures into a great web of symptoms and a seedy exchange of signs."12J A~ Ranciere argues, this desire to atone for the perceived excesses of symptomatic reading leads Barthes to create a false impasse between the cognitive act of demystifying interpretation (in which, according to Barthes, the photographic image is reduced to "discourse encoding his- tory") and a purely affective response (in which the photographic image is similarly reduced to "raw material presence").'24 As if to repent of "having spent much of his life saying: 'Look out! What you are taking for visible self-evidence is ill fac.l an encoded message whereby a society or authority legitimates itself by nmralizing itself,' " Barthes develops his concept of studium as that which invites passionless mechanical aca- '. , demic decoding so he can directly oppose it to t…

was gratified but also impatient at being constricted by the role of literary figure, concerned about her privacy and the proliferation of her “real” and “false” im- ages. Although these ambivalences are themselves topoi of the cronica, voiced by other writers, in Lispector they entered the world of her fiction, which would henceforth always include a problematic yet persistent play with autobiographi- cal reference. It seems likely that Lispector first planned to use autobiography in The Stream of Life as a sort of counterfiction, a repositioning of her obsessive themes, not in terms of invented characters, but rather in terms of “Clarice herself”: a corro- sive antiliterature (“This is an anti-book,” she wrote on the title page of “Objeto gritante”), a “letter-book” {livro-carta, a term used throughout the draft). One of the four epigraphs to the draft is a phrase of Roland Barthes’s: …

that gives her discourse its political purpose and its gravity, and which makes of these seminars the continuation of the project of Etrangers à nous mémes (1988) and Les nouvelles maladies de l’âme (1993). At the same time both volumes follow the pattern established by La révolution du langage poétique (1974) and Pouvoirs de l’horreur of a lengthy and complex theoretical (i.e. psychoanalytic) introduction which makes up nearly half of Sens and over one third of La Révolte. These are then followed by a dense exploration of specific theoretical and literary texts that they have been developed to make possible.

by unseen forces working below the surface. Unlike the later meditation, though, those forces are here not named. Instead, we see only the results of historical change. Even the conﬁguration of the tables in the booth – set at an angle, their inner edges converge precipitously – stands as a metaphor for history; like the one-way street, history moves inevitably toward con- striction, toward a reduction of human liberty. Yet that process is visible only through distorted mirrors and in the guise of pleasure. At the center of the piece, then, is Benjamin’s reading of the experience of contemporary history. The description of a series of vivid tableaux evokes the fragmented, discontinuous experience of a distorted history; the puppets in the tableaux, in their gruesome combination of verisimilitude and ostentatious machine action, comment on the character of human response – on the sort of …

Roland Barthes, Bernard Stiegler, and David Wills. What is ghostly about Eno and Byrne’s uncanny soundscape, notes Wolfe, is that it underscores the way in which recordings of ourselves live on in our absence. Wolfe further sug- gests that Derrida’s logic of the specter, “a trace that marks the present with its absence in advance” (Derrida 2002, 117), need not be considered as a “kind of fatalism or necrophilia,” but a simple “fact” about where “futurity itself resides” (294). The simple fact is “that the words we record now, the images we make now, will be iterable in our absence, and indeed in the absence of any ‘empiri- cal being’ currently alive in ‘the living present’” (294). Derrida’s morbid notion of the “messianic” comes into play here, since, as Wolfe puts it, “we die so that they, the future ones [the recordings of ourselves], may live” (294). While this self-­spectral…

sopher’s wife (or sister, or mother in some cases). The sexual imagery is quite deliberate; she has in mind a kind of ‘amorous exchange’ in which sexual difference would be enacted in language, and she attempts to suggest this textually, to a certain extent, by mingling her own voice with the voice/text of the philosopher. This can be seen in its purest, unmixed form, in Speculum, where one of the sections (‘Une Mere de glace’), consists entirely of extracts from Plotinus, judiciously selected. (Irigaray is here only present in the selection of extracts.) Irigaray states specifically at the end of Speculum that: Precise references in the form of notes or punctuation indi¬ cating quotation have often been omitted. Because in relation to

Second, because the lectures also amend the image presented by many critics of the later Barthes as a hedonist who could not be in- convenienced by theoretical consistency, and for whom the only thing that mattered was the pleasure of reading, without any further obliga- tion. The lecture notes make clear that, behind the apparent hedonism, there indeed lurked a consistent argument. Literary studies were, ac- cording to the later Barthes, a way to care for the self, and this is why he viewed his lecture series at the Collège de France above all as an ethical experiment, as he emphasised in an interview from 1979: Dans mon cours, au Collège, vous avez pu voir que je ne travaille pas une œuvre, je lis des œuvres, et puis je fais passer des morceaux de
