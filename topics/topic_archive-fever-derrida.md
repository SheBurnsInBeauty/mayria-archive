argues in Archive Fever, is oriented to, just as it is defi ned by, a peculiar structure of temporality. We perhaps conceive of the archive as a response, material or affective, to the past, as working toward a preservation of what has been, but Derrida wishes to emphasize the degree to which the archive works authoritatively to mark out the space of beginnings and futurity. In his elaborate reading of Yosef Yerushalmi’s Freud’s Moses (and we need to remember that Derrida’s theory of the archive emerges out of a reading of another’s reading of the Freudian archive: his theory of the archive thus takes the form of what he might call a “dangerous supplement” to the thoughts of another), he draws our attention to the etymology of the word “archive,” noting that the term itself means a place of commandment and commencement. The archive thus operates to assert a kind of juridical control: Arkhe, we recall, names at once the commencement and the commandment.

mourning. 29. My phrasing here is ironic. Several of the critics cited above allude to Derrida, Archive Fever, and/or Specters of Marx. As these critics recognize, Derrida critiques the fever for the archive, seeing in it an investment in originary meaning. 30. For a similarly skeptical view, see Radel’s review of Queer Renaissance Historiography. 31. Dinshaw, How Soon Is Now? 39, 104. 32. Dinshaw, How Soon Is Now? 32. 33. Dinshaw qualiﬁes her claims on behalf of asynchrony as not ‘‘inherently positive’’ (How Soon Is Now? 34). 34. Those critics focused on negative affects are particularly cognizant of affective resis- tance, and Love, in Feeling Backward, seems explicitly motivated by this question. 35.

Introduction In mental life nothing which has once been formed can perish. —Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents Thought cannot welcome that which it bears within itself and which sustains it, except by forgetting. —Blanchot, The Writing of the Disaster The archive always works, and a priori, against itself. —Derrida, Archive Fever: A Freudian Impression Preamble Melancholy and the Archive fi nds its impetus and inspiration in a series of frustrations. I have been a serious reader of Freud and Derrida for decades; their work, specifi cally that dealing with ideas of loss, memory, and mourn- ing, has deeply informed my readings of a variety of modern and contem- porary writers. It is safe to say that without Beyond the Pleasure Principle, “Mourning and Melancholia,” Archive Fever, or The Ear of the Other, I (and of course others) would not have been able to begin to think carefully about the complex protocols of memory and trauma at work in contemporary

Derrida’s Archive Fever, Lippit attributes the challenging logic of Tanizaki’s culturalist suffering to an unabsorbed and unassimilated “oriental” unconscious—an “imagi- nary, phantasmatic, racialized archive” (13). I like Lippit’s association of this logic with what is unconscious and even “outlaw” (11), but we differ on whether it is part of an attempt to “express a national and nationalist sensibility” (108). Interestingly, Lippit reads Tanizaki’s cultural particularlism—especially the shadowy Japanese body that “writes on others, infect[ing] them with darkness” (107)—as a prescient 1930s alternative to the 1940s atomic writing that would obliterate bodies with light. 4. Ironically, as Naoki Sakai points out, Watsuji identifies the climatological method itself as part of a Western intellectual tradition, locating himself in a geneal- ogy that begins with Hippocrates and includes Kant, Hegel, and Marx. Sakai notes

are interested in is here described not so much as an opening to what comes from the future, what might potentially threaten the entity in question, but rather, as a radically threatening compromise (one that does not pose the possi- bility of “sacrificial self- destruction” but in some sense actually enacts it) abso- lutely necessary for its living on. The fullest indications of this thought are to be found in Archive Fever, written just after “Faith and Knowledge” and very much of a piece with this earlier text. In fact, though it is not often considered as such, Archive Fever forms one of the key texts in the nexus of works (Specters, “Faith and Knowledge,” and Rogues) in which the logic of autoimmunity and survival is spelled out. The relevant passages are to be found in Derrida’s discussion of Freud’s Civi- lization and Its Discontents (1929), in which Freud grapples with th…

Introduction 5 kind of a library (or museum) are you running if it’s chock full of porn? Porn archives, ostensibly authorizing the legitimacy of the study of pornography, may simultaneously undermine the authority of the archive. The contributors to this volume negotiate that tension in differing ways, as have many archi- vists and pornographers before them. In Archive Fever, Derrida pursues a related tension that seems to inhere in the archive. By describing archivization in terms of Freud’s concept of the death drive, Derrida shows how archival power consists in the capacity to de- stroy as well as to preserve. It is not merely that institutions such as libraries are often compelled to deaccess or destroy some of their holdings in order to make room for new ones but, more fundamentally, that the urge to archive necessitates destruction. This argument is especially pertinent to the place of pornography in the archive because porn is routinely deemed more worthy

foregrounded the importance of ‘cutting’ and ‘grafting’ in Derrida’s work. She clarifies that she has ‘employed no single principle but [has] grouped the sets of selections according each time to a loosely defined criterion’ (Kamuf 1991: x). This discussion of criteria for the specific Derrida anthology has a wider significance for Derrida scholarship insofar as Kamuf tries to justify this approach in terms of Derrida’s own ‘repeated insistence on the partialness of any text’:

The Traces of Jacques Derrida’s Cinema can be read through its reflections of this crucial place or series of places that arrange the conflicts defining the modern university, a type of crossroads testing our passions, inhibitions, chances, travail, awareness, not least our faith and time. TBD Noting the posthumous publication and translation of Derrida’s seminars as well as the “archive fever” burning for the objects and historical anecdotes of his past, Michael Naas envisions “a full reappraisal of Derrida’s work and of his place in twentieth century philosophy and literary theory.

23 1. On the Edge of Afﬁ rmation: Derrida It might well appear a strange decision to begin with the work of Jacques Derrida when one of the key features of contemporary afﬁ rma- tionism has been its tendency to claim to have surpassed or exceeded deconstruction. The persistent characterisation of Derrida’s oeuvre in negative terms – inﬁ nite deferral, delay, marginality, anti- systemic fragmentation and, at worst, theoretical and political paralysis – has often been the starting point for the articulation of new afﬁ rmative alternatives. To take one instance, Alain Badiou, in relation to artistic practice, argues that we must ‘renounce the delights of the margin, of obliqueness, of inﬁ nite deconstruction, of the fragment, of the exhibi- tion trembling with mortality, of ﬁ nitude and of the body’.1 Regarding these forms as complicit with the ideological dynamics of contemporary capitalism Badiou opposes to them the need for ‘monumental construc-

willing victim of Derrida’s ‘archive fever’, or Steedman’s ‘feverlet’ (Derrida, 1998; Steedman, 2001, pp. 18–19). As Steedman has written, those whose form of writing originates in the archive believe that their output can refl ect what is not present amongst the documents as much as what has been found: a form of writing that celebrates the constraints on it, constraints that – so it is said – are made by the documents themselves: ‘what they forbid you to write, the permissions they offer’ (2001, p. xi). The archive in question is that of the London couturier, Sir Norman Hartnell (1901–1979). Hartnell’s career as a fashion designer began as a young man aged 22 in 1923, dressing the debutante sisters of his university friends and their mothers, and continued until his death in 1979. His fashion collections were immediately followed with interest by the international press. De…

will not preserve its truth. We seem, of course, to be moving (again) toward Derrida here, and his very early assertion that There is always a surprise in store for the anatomy or physiology of any criticism that might think it had mastered the game, surveyed all the threads at once, deluding itself, too, in wanting to look at the text without touching it, without laying a hand on the “object,” without risking— which is the only chance of entering the game, by getting a few fingers caught—the addition of some new thread. (Derrida, “Pharmacy” 63) But, of course, to go back to Derrida is to begin rethinking the object—any object, or any thing—as text, as a weave of particulars perpetually undoing the notion of unity (truth or final meaning) by perpetually intertwining and confusing themselves with other things. Are we now then in danger of slipping back into postmodern extremism, …

But the next to last session of the second volume astonishes in the explicit and heartfelt alliance between deconstruction and feminism that it invokes. In that session Derrida returns to Sigmund Freud, following the red thread of blood as philosophy – and here psychoanalysis – shows itself to be unable to oppose the death penalty. Locating anxiety regarding the flow of blood, Freud finds himself turning his discussion of the defloration of women into one of female resentment born of penis envy (that is not the surprise). What is striking but, again, not surprising is Freud’s twofold transition from the so-called ‘primitive’ peoples to his contemporary moment (itself a familiar synthesis from his colonial orchestration of the Subject of Europe in his speculative writings).13 Firstly he locates the clearest instances of such resentment among ‘the strivings and in the literary productions of “emancipated” women’ in his

operate at the level of their theoretical or propositional grounds? Or, on the basis of the ‘performative’, i.e. by looking at what theorists ‘do’ with desire, or how they desire, as much as what they ‘say’ about it (and asking why)? (The latter would of course redouble the question of desire, indeed triangulate it within a complex force-field of writing and reading permitting no simple position of neutrality or exemption.) Or, would one ‘compare’ on the basis of a more ‘obscure economy’ than either of these possibilities – i.e. the constative or the performative – would imply? We could continue this game of thinking desire within a variety of Derridean contexts without obvious horizon, but we will not. What we are more interested in is interrogating the very possibility of thinking desire through deconstruction as well as the dynamics between deconstruction and desire. If Derrida’s work in texts such as Archive Fever and Resistances suggests that psychoanalysis’s

10 Proust between Deleuze and Derrida of his engagement with the Recherche remains elusive. It is precisely this remainder that I want to explore in this book. However, instead of trying to draw speculative conclusions from direct references, my aim is to show how the quality of deferral that writing takes on as remains, as marks that subsist and insist, always différantly, shares an essential, motivating force for Derrida as well as for Proust. For a theorist so concerned with the cultural and archival dissemination of all kinds of writing, Derrida worked to show how the influence one text, writer or signatory can have, intentionally or otherwise, on another is always nebulous and unpredictable. It is dependent on the force of remains. ‘Longtemps je me suis, for a long time I ­have – ­been interested in the biodegradable’, Derrida writes towards the beginning of ‘Biodegradables: Seven Diary Fragments’, his text that deals most

Introduction 13 reading burns letters in the way that a flame divides into manifold tongues as it consumes the body of what it touches. This erotic and destructive inflam- matory encounter inaugurates the event of reading. Reading, Derrida suggests throughout his text, only happens when letters are set on fire; moreover, the Envois are love letters because they burn. Meanwhile, fire, flames, tinder, embers, cinders and ashes link the work on mourning (on the crypt and the incalculable remainder) in Glas and Fors to the pyrotechnic erotic encounter between philosophy and psychoanalysis in the Post Card and announce the later writings on translation, poetry and the secret. In French, as Marder shows, Derrida’s text already anticipates (and even calls for) the effects of the trans- lation to come. Whenever he invokes the idiom ‘tongue of fire’ (‘langue de feu’) he is always already writing about how translation teases out what is untrans-

Pascale’s overt reference to ghosts is consolidated by the importance of the voice recorder to Derrida’s understanding of spectrality. In Archive Fever, Derrida exposes the aporia that while we know that someone deceased will never speak again, in any case ‘the phantom continues to speak’ (AF 62), ‘like the answering machine whose voice outlives its moment of recording’ (AF 62). For Derrida, ‘there would be neither history nor tradition nor cul- ture without that possibility’ (AF 62–3), the necessary possibility of a spectral response informed and mediated by technology, such as the device into which Pascale speaks. This is more than sufficient to initiate a heuristic response to the film that would follow the semantic chain of its visual, verbal and aural spectralities. But what if, instead, we follow the knife? To do so is to jump across the subsequent violent encounter with …

As a writer Derrida is both productive and difficult. This creates material and psychological difficulties in writing about his work. The library of Trinity College, Cambridge has made some matters of bibliography a great deal easier than they might otherwise have been, and I owe thanks.

has been cut off and that haunts the text” (69). Rapaport proposes that if we read Derrida’s writings on archives while keeping the “phantom limb in mind, archives occur at that moment when there is a structural breakdown in memory” (Rapaport 1998, 69). Put another way, archives, like the phantom limb, are products of trauma. Rappaport suggests that archives, for Derrida, are thereby fragmented, bor- dering on a madness that, like the phantom limb, cannot be explained: “[i]t is an insanity that defies anything like an essentialist (but also constructivist) explanation” (Rapaport 1998, 80). While intriguing, Rapaport’s reading is somewhat problem- atic because there is a certain conflation between phantom limbs, archives and texts. By suggesting that “The Post Card may well be Archive Fever’s phantom limb”, and that Archive Fever has “phantom textual limbs”, Rapaport suggests that…

view, Derrida's emotive qualities burst the bounds of his thought. Sep- arating Derrida's emotiveness from his philosophy ends in the idea that where Derrida exhibits emotion, he is out of control-in his sar- castic riposte to John Searle in Limited Inc, for example, or in his de- fense of his friend Paul de Man. The critical dispute about Derrida's willingness to show emotion, especially in the debate about de Man's wartime journalism, is itself impassioned; I will discuss some of the terms of the controversy in Chapter 4. First, however, I want to pro- pose an interpretation of Derrida's work that lets us see how emotion engages the textual structures that belong to the paradigm of the death of the subject-the paradigm emotion is presumed to exceed. To do this, I draw upon the same matrix of ideas that generates

themselves, both more and less embodied. I am reminded of a passage in Derrida’s Archive Fever – where he describes an archive not as a library or a warehouse of knowledge or any other kind of building, but as ‘spectral a priori: neither present nor absent “in the flesh”, neither visible nor invisible, a trace always referring to another whose eyes can never be met’ (Archive Fever, p. 84). The text is not an actual object, not a book, a work or any kind of product. When we read, it haunts us. Later Headstone says ‘With Mr Eugene Wrayburn in my mind, I went on’ (Our Mutual Friend, p. 399). He has incorporated his rival as an image, lost the distinction between himself and the person he hates. He is incapable of being beside him without beginning to internalize him. I once had proposals to make the university a less mournful place: I wanted to teach students ways of understan…

text arise as if as a means of compensating for these gaps and silences within the ofﬁcial records of historiography. Stories gives rise to more stories in an interminable process that, while attempting to ﬁx the ever-shifting historical ground, only generates further textuality. Early Gothic writing, in this respect, is the writing of Jacques Derrida’s ‘archive fever’, the mode that anxiously sets about the recording, arrangement and narrativisation of history even as it tirelessly confronts the deathly pulsion towards archival incompletion, obliteration and lack.26 The simultaneity of historical retrieval and erasure, recovery and loss is central to the form, a doubleness to which the Gothic responds with the further engendering of romance. Political theorist, philosopher and Gothic novelist William Godwin articulated the grounds for what we might describe as a distinctly ‘Gothic’ 23 R…

Introduction 11 On Touching – Jean-Luc Nancy (Derrida 2005) is also extraordinarily affirmative, and one can say, somewhat transgressive. It reminds one of the explosive and recalcitrant dimension of deconstruction which is too often lost in attempts to subsume Derrida’s thought under, for example, attempts to ‘return’ to more or less orthodox versions of ethics or religion. As with Deleuze and Guattari’s Anti- Oedipus (Deleuze and Guattari 2004), as Foucault (Foucault 2004) notes, Derrida’s texts are also always directed against a certain kind of ‘fascism’; ‘the fascism in us all, in ours heads and in our everyday behaviour…the tracking down of all variations of fascism, from the enormous ones that surround us and crush us to the petty ones that constitute the tyrannical bitterness of our everyday lives’ (Foucault 2004: xiv). Derrida’s ‘l’écriture du corps’, I will argue, is an…

embraces a revival of interest in post-punk spectres such as TG, who were also, of course, concerned with the possibility of a future in which things were otherwise. For Derrida, the ghost must be preserved as leverage to ‘dislodge any present out of its contemporaneity with itself’ (1994: 73), heeded as an untimely injunction ‘to produce new events, new effective forms of action, practice, organisation, and so forth’ (89). However, haun- tology can also be understood in the context of the global flows and networked space of late modernity. A sense of absence is installed at the heart of experience as time and space become disjunctive, any given moment or given place interconnected with and traversed by a multi- plicity of other moments and places. In the generalised indistinction of the non-place and the non-event, antagonism is difficult to sustain and we are, many commentators would argue, plunged into an era of

our viewing by forging links with thinking encountered in the ﬁlms of Dreyer. Derrida and ethics One of the charges that has been repeatedly levelled against deconstruction is that it is ethically irresponsible, or at least evasive and obscurantist when confronted with the urgent moral problems of our age. Derrida’s critics have objected that his concepts of ‘différance’ and ‘undecidability’ undermine the grounds of ethical action and lead to moral relativism. During much of his career, Derrida’s engagement with ethical themes was intermittent and oblique. But in the last two decades of his life, notably in the wake of the Paul de Man controversy, he began to turn more frequently to explicitly ethical as well as political concerns and endeavoured to demonstrate how these were integral to the deconstructive project. As mentioned in the introduction to this book, in Levinas’s writings Derr…

a “sublime” influenza: non-pathological, multidirectional, life-giving. We “come down” with them despite our immune systems, no-go zones, and self-protection rites. And coming down with them inside our own sites of cultural and theoretical experimentation allows for a symbolic germination that, on one side, is enabled by the digital-humanities applications of new data storage and communication cybercapabilities and, on the other side, would be impossible without the germ of otherness, without others and their theoretical cultures. Hardly an intracultural affair, theory obtains by way of contacts, interculturally or, Jacques Derrida would say, “haptically,” as it touches and is touched by other cultural and theoretical systems—as

21 Nomadic Subjects and the Feminist Archives1 Lisa Baraitser Abstract The publication of the second edition of Rosi Braidotti’s seminal book Nomadic Subjects: Embodiment and Sexual Difference in Contemporary Feminist Theory invites us to think about the notion of feminist archives. In Archive Fever, Jacques Derrida links archive to the death drive, understanding archivation as both conservative and institutive, a “prosthesis” to retentive memory while always being yet-to-come. In the way Braidotti has assembled the second edition of Nomadic Subjects, she proposes a different kind of archive—one that eschews the death drive in favor of a mode of “counter-memory” that is deeply political in its intent. In forgetting to forget injustice, Braidotti’s feminist archive insists on making a difference, while also providing us with the theoretical tools for understanding difference di…

At the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the English trans- lation, Going Postcard: The Letter(s) o[Jacques Derrida revisits this seminal work in Derrida's oeuvre. Derrida himself descri- bed The Post Card in his preface as "the remainders of a destroyed correspondence," stretching from 1977 to 1979. A cryptic text, it is riddled with gaps, word plays, and a meandering analysis of the postal relations between philosophy and psychoanalysis. The contributors who offered the fourteen essays gathe- red in Going Postcard were each provided with a decep- tively simple task: to address a gloss from the first part of The Post Card, "Envois." The result is a prismatic array of commentaries, excursions, and interpretations that take Derrida "to the letter." The different glosses on lemmas suc…

Only recently and reluctantly have feminists taken a positive turn in the direction of Gilles Deleuze’s philosophy. Where the texts of Jacques Derrida and Jacques Lacan have been a mainstay of feminist theories of subjectivity for several decades, welcoming receptions of Deleuze’s philosophy have been few and far apart. The reasons for this fact may be attributed to geography: Derrida and Paul de Man were the subject of intense scrutiny in the development of the ‘Yale School’ of deconstruction in the 1970s that located the ori- gins of sexual difference in enunciation. As utterers of inherited idioms, they argued, we quickly discover that language tends to mold our identity before we have anything to say about it. Only by working into an actively performative relation with language do we, as ‘subjects’, begin to alter its formative effects. The Yale School gained renown as a site where F…

Introduction 13 repeating given its implications for this study: despite the range and interdisciplinarity of Derrida’s oeuvre, he did not produce a written work on cinema or films. To be sure—​and as the first two chapters develop in greater depth—​Derrida’s published and unpublished corpus, in addition to his par­ ticipation in films, contain noteworthy meditations on or about the medium that exist and converse with a host of his texts brushing up against cinema and its topoi, for instance, the visual arts, photography, television, and the teletechnological. Although these publications can be viewed to advance to­ ward or loom over cinema in a categorical manner, there is no denying that, for some, the subject irradiates as a sort of protracted blind spot or curious missing link within Derrida’s archive, acutely so if this determination relies on the “unambiguous” empirical t…

writing. By exhibiting the patterns of organizations, filaments of construction, micromovements, circuits of argumentation, which constitute the undercurrent of his writings from which, like the tips of icebergs, Derrida’s coinages of individual terms, positions, and determined arguments, including “deconstruction”, emerge to be thematized, Hobson succeeds in demonstrating the rigor of Derrida’s work, more precisely, the unheard kind of consistency that characterizes it. Above all, this superb study on the question of language in Derrida, and Derrida’s language, by emphasizing his writerly strategy of sketching links, reinforcing connections between words, themes, arguments, and providing for extensions into other texts, shows Derrida’s work to stage incalculable possibilities of connection from whence future commentaries are allowed to proceed.’ Rodolphe Gasché, Eugenio Donato Professor of Comparative Literature, State University of New York at Buffalo

to have this very speech not only collected but included under the sign of “the confused and terrible expression ‘the work of mourning.’” Indecent, and yet . . . while I might be tempted to reject the title of the American edition, citing as evidence Derrida’s seem- ing distaste for the expression, tempted to dismiss it as Brault’s and Naas’s and instead embrace the French title as the real thing, the real Derridian thing, more evocative, less crude, I think that would be missing the point of the very particular practice I am glimpsing here. A practice that is at once extremely sensitive to indecency but nonetheless does not attempt to remain decent and pure. While we might want to connect this to a general Derridian project of deconstructing purity, we see the ethical stakes of this, I think, most acutely in these texts written in response to the death of friends. Brault and Naas, the initiators of this collection, themselves

my first chapter and the ethics of indecency Derrida proffers in my second. If for Derrida the indecency was located in the memorial genre, in Sedgwick’s mourning essays what is indecent has more to do with the moment, with timing.2 Sedgwick’s memorial writ- ing, as we read it in Tendencies, is the site of an indecent, perverse, uncanny encounter with temporality. : : : : : : The opening to Tendencies is all about time. The foreword— entitled “T Times”—begins by discussing T- shirts seen at the 1992 gay pride parade in New York; surveying the T’s, Sedgwick concludes, “It was a Queer time.”3 Echoing this declaration, the

Facebook. We will ﬁnd hyperbolical rather than suggestive Derrida’s thesis that most of the elementary information processes in the living cell are also a type of writing ‘and one whose system is never closed’ (Kirby, 1997, p. 61), because it is actually now possible to write (manipulate) cellular DNA. The topic of the speciﬁcity of the symptom is always quite slippery. It is a fact that, although we know little about it, no other symptom lends itself as well as does the hypochondriac symptom to parodying and self-parodying the idea of the body as substance, constantly putting its inadequacy on show. The doctor who denies substance to the hypochondriac symptom is not yet putting himself in the different perspective of a crisis of the sense of belonging to a social order made ﬂesh, to actualization in a given context of Rede. He conﬁnes himself to rejecting the patient’s suggestion, but f…

Fish, Christopher Norris, William Ray . . . as the manuscript was going through its last revisions Suzanne Gearhart published a stunning piece in Diacritics and Henry Staten's important Wittgenstein and Derrida appeared while the manuscript was being edited. As will be readily apparent, this list represents no emergent school or position—but it does signal a renewed willing- ness to grapple with the novelty and difficulty of things and texts Derridean, a new willingness to receive or re-receive that work. The book has incurred considerable debts along its way and only the most pressing can be discharged here. The foremost is certainly to Francoise Meltzer at the University of Chicago. Ted Cohen and Paul Ricoeur of the Philosophy Department there also contributed greatly to the final shape of the manuscript. More diffuse debts are owed to Kenneth Northcott and Richard Strier.

Derrida proposes an extended analysis of these phenomena which, he insists, are multiple (he refers to them at one point as ‘resistances- misunderstandings’5), and all the more intractable in that they affect not only political, philosophical, literary opponents of Cixous’ work (notably in the form of what Derrida calls ‘the armed force of misogyny and phallogocentrism’6), but also, most insidiously, those on the ‘inside’. One can resist something even as one supports it, Derrida notes. In fact, Derrida diagnoses in his own reading relationship to Cixous a certain tireless resistance – dating back at least to the mid-1960s, when she gave him the manuscript of what would be her fi rst book of fi ction, published in 1967. This is certainly a signifi cant avowal for Derrida: one imagines he would make short work of most resistances. And he does not claim to have vanquished this r…

8 IntroductIon its most forceful potential in the thought of life as autoimmune, where the basic conditions of the living are thought in terms of processes of internal division and contamination as well as originary exposure to destruction, a feature of Derrida’s thinking that frequently gets lost in discussions of Der- ridean autoimmunity. Chapter 3 concludes by addressing a competing inter- pretation of Derrida and Freud with respect to these issues advanced by Martin Hägglund. My account shows that the exposure to radical destruction figured in Derrida’s activation of the death drive stems from a structure more primor- dial than simply an opening to the unpredictable future, as Hägglund con- ceptualizes it. With an explanation of how survival is to be understood firmly in place, chapter 4 undertakes a study of the ethical and political implications, the full scope of which ar…

defend this thesis from the angle opened by Habermas's and Derrida's sharply distinct readings of the Enlightenment. I also discuss the rela­ tionship between philosophy and history and identify different models of political commitment. This will enable the reader to place the inter­ ventions of Habermas and Derrida in a larger context. The dialogues not only express Habermas's and Derrida's unique styles of thinking but bring into play the very core of their philosophi­ cal theories. Each dialogue is accompanied by a critical essay in which my purpose is both to highlight the main arguments on terror and ter­ rorism that Habermas and Derrida advance on this occasion and to show how they fit in the larger context of their respective theoretical frameworks. This book is the first occasion in which Habermas and Derrida have agreed to appear side by side, responding to a similar sequence of questions in a parallel manner.

Derrida and Other Animals 16 – ­much shortened from the translation published in Critical Inquiry (almost fifty pages) in 2001­ – ­the extract is indeed the same length as David Wood’s commentary (‘Thinking with Cats’, 129–44). While it is typically the nature of collections to have to present shorter pieces, I mention the abridging here because of the tendency of some writers in this field to cite Derrida in passing without perhaps having experi- enced his thinking on the question as it unfolds over a particular time span of reading or writing. There is a tendency to aphoristic or even gnomic pronouncement in the name of Derrida­ – ­while a slower, more meandering path might lead in, and to, a slightly different sens, both as direction and feeling. In any case, since this essay has proved such an important text not only for what it says but on account of its reception, I shall briefly outline some of the points of engagement here as well as intermit-

set out in the writings of Walter Benjamin, and one to be developed in this introduction to account for the curious dissonance between the writings of Benjamin and the responses they evoke in Jacques Derrida's writings.1 The two antinomies discussed by Benjamin provide a frame for adducing the antinomy between Benjamin and Derrida, and for exploring the relation between Benjamin's writings and Kant's aesthetics. This third antinomy provides a preliminary orientation for those who are perhaps more familiar with Derrida's responses to Benjamin than with the writings of Benjamin himself. Benjamin's writings pose formidable difficulties in both reading and exposition and I shall briefly indicate what I take to be the major obstacles preventing an adequate response to them, making it tempting to accept Derrida's readings as expositions, which Derrida himself would never claim them to be.

able, the unanticipatable, the non-identifiable, in short, as that of which one does not yet have a memory” (18). It is easy to see in The Other Heading how much Derrida’s own recent work anticipates the question of narrative after deconstruction. In asking how the new Europe can be both part of a cultural tradition and “unanticipatable,” Derrida invokes the question suspended within the title of this book: how can narrative come out of and also break from deconstruction? The mechanism of this complex temporality is more explicit within another of Derrida’s recent books, Archive Fever (1995). Like The Other Heading, this book examines the relationship viii . Preface

He was involved in yet ambivalent about the forces mobilized in the French strikes of May 1968, but his philosophy was crucial to the intellectual upheavals that took place at that time. Derrida published three more books in 1972: La Dissémination (Dissemination), a collection of four long essays, from which our selection titled “Plato’s Pharmacy” is taken; Marges de la philosophie (Margins of Philosophy), another collection of essays; and Positions, the texts of three interviews (the first of many he granted over the years). These early books are touchstones for deconstruc- tive literary criticism; many others followed. In 1975 Derrida was invited to teach a few weeks a year at Yale University, where he was soon considered a me…

pleasure of intellectual work involves immense tensions within individu- als and requires a correspondingly thorough discharge of those tensions. I don’t need to tell you about the terrifically complex economies that this gives rise to in us as teachers and writers. We tend to suffer, and to cause suffering. Frantic change at the surface. Fewer and fewer nesting places for the dream bird. Still, here we are, devoting ourselves to the immense, the extraordinary pleasure of reading Derrida and Freud, thinkers of pleasure in its principled and unprincipled relation to other points of reference. For them both, a temporal factor, rhythm, is hugely important in the negotiation between quantities of tension and qualities of feeling. Rhythm can be there in the writing itself. Derrida speaks of rhythm in a very strange way: as ‘what suspends the course of the writing, the rhythm of th…

of urgency that assail us.” Derrida’s co-foundational role in the International Parliament of Writers (IPW) and his involvement in its “Cities of Asylum” network surely constitute one of the most sited and constructive moments of an admirable and ever-more legible engagement. * * * In May 1993, an assassin gunned down Algerian novelist Tahar Djaout in front of his home in a suburb of Algiers. Alarmed, Christian Salmon and others involved in the Strasbourg-based Carrefour des littératures européenes responded by issuing an appeal for a new structure to support writers threatened with violence or censorship.1 Approximately 300 international novelists, poets, journalists, and intellectuals signed on to the July 1993 appeal. Organizational discussions took place the following November, when writers gathered in Strasbourg for the annual meeting of the Carrefour, and the IPW was formally found…

LYOTARD: PHILOSOPHY, POLITICS, AND THE SUBLIME respect, and he, in turn, will speak today—“de coeur. ” My only regret is that Jacques Derrida has had so many adieux to give in recent years, and I am deeply affected by the call for him to give this one— in the name of Jean-Frangois Lyotard. Jean-Frangois Lyotard was a friend to so many of us here— those of us who knew him personally, those of us who knew him for his politics, those of us who knew him for his aesthetic theory, those of us who knew him for his philosophy, those of us who knew him for his writings on literature, art, and religion. And there is no doubt that we will continue to work with him, his splendid, perspicuous, brilliant, some- times enigmatic, often probing, but always sublime thought will be with us— as a friend and figure of IAPL, as a marker of what needs to be thought into the next cen- tury. I will miss t…

(As I note in Chapter 3, the number of publications devoted to the idea of ethics or politics in Derrida, to cite a prominent example, starts to spike immediately after 1987.) Just a year later, Gayatri Spivak—who had studied under Paul de Man at Cornell University and who had introduced Derrida’s thought to an American audience in her translation of and formidable commentary on Of Grammatology— publishes a seminal essay, “Can the Subaltern Speak” (1988),65 effectively inaugurating the “political turn” in Theory.66 With this essay, Spivak helps define a new field, “postcolonial studies,” thereby bringing Edward Said— retroactively considered the progenitor of thi…

These questions, I show, are opened anew by Derrida’s writings, which dis- place the traditional anthropo-philosophical conception of donation and, in so doing, lay the groundwork for a novel examination of the gift and poetry’s interrelation. What separates Derrida’s work on the gift is, first and foremost, his refusal to reduce it either to a simple object of representation or to a mere form of exchange. As he explores in Given Time, what the work of phenomenologists such as Heidegger and anthropologists such as Mauss alike reveals, is the funda- mental, structuring role that gifts play for the spacing of time, the thinging of the thing, and the becoming subject of the subject. ‘The gift gives, demands, and takes time. The thing gives, demands, or takes time,’ Derrida writes of Mauss’s account of gift-giving in the Essay on the Gift.12 By this he means that there is no pure, h…

Derrida and the Writing of the Body 28 we might best understand the mediation of Hegel by Bataille and its influence on Derrida’s work, by looking at Bruce Baugh’s seminal interpretation of the ‘French Hegel’ (Baugh 2005). However, in many respects, Derrida’s focus on Hegel serves to occlude other influences from Bataille’s work, such as his conception of embodiment and desire, and especially his conception of the relationship between prohibition and transgression. I will argue that these aspects of Bataille’s work have been a pivotal resource for Derrida’s own thinking of the relation between philosophy and what he calls ‘nonphilosophy’. A Genealogy of Dissidence As with Artaud, it can be difficult to categorise Bataille in relation to philosophical or cultural movements. One strand of thinking which they share relates to the surrealist movement. Artaud, for example, for a tim…

the late 19th and early 20th centuries, migrating by trains to the North in search of jobs, safety, and a less racist environment. Siting the blues within a Derridean framework can be a useful exer- cise in that it provides us with a specifically Afro-American translation of différance, but reading Derrida through the prism of American blues can also be instructive. Translation, after all, works both ways; "call and response" can always be reversed, with striking results. It is tempt- ing to think of Derrida as one of Baker's "freight-hopping hobos," and indeed The Post Card, with its recurrent train imagery, encourages us to do so. What happens if we relocate Derrida, sidetrack him if you will, from a Parisian metro car to a Southern railway boxcar, from the European Orient Express to an Afro-American soul train? One of the things which we learn is that Derrida is a master at …

has always been critical, even contemptuous, of Derrida, whose work she finds obscure, conceptually anarchic, ethically desiccated, and politically counterproductive. Reading Derrida, Nussbaum says, creates in her “a cer- tain hunger for blood” (Love’s Knowledge [LK] 171).10 Flouting Derridean doctrine, Nussbaum proclaims herself a firm believer in a determinate con- ception of the human good and the projects of moral and social reform that can follow from such a conception. Whereas, in the climate of Derrida, a
