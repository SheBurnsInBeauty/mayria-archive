      "text": "15 Benjamin and the Loss of Aura The B-effect (or at least, concepts contributing to the B-effect) may be traced to the very dawn of the postmodern era, in Walter Benjamin’s celebrated essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1936). Here, Benjamin misleadingly meditates upon the “decay” (225), the “shriveling” (233), and the “destruction” (240) of what he calls the “aura of art.” Proposing that this aura, or the sense of a work’s uniqueness, is “inseparable from its being imbedded in the fabric of tradition” (225), Benjamin suggests that “the technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition” so that “that which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art” (223). At best, Benjamin offers a half-truth. Considered from the perspective of such early advocates of the C- effect as the futurist artist Carlo Carrà, those experimenting with",

      "text": "Walter Benjamin (1892–1940) Walter Benjamin was closely associated with the Frankfurt School but he was very much a maverick thinker. His early writing was on Goethe and German Baroque drama. His best known essay is undoubtedly The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, in which he argued that modern means of reproducing works of art, especially photography and ﬁlm, have changed the special status of a work of art.This is also true, of course, of the reproduction of musical performances. Benjamin argues that works of art once used to have the quality of unique- ness which he calls their ‘aura’. Even in the case of litera- ture which, of course, had long been available in multiple copies, this aura had been maintained. Many kinds of modern works of art are actually designed with a view to reproducing them, as is the case with art prints, for example. In the case of the cinema …",

But the amazing growth of our tech- niques, the adaptability and precision they have attained, the ideas and habits they are creating, make it a certainty that profound changes are impending in the ancient craft of the Beautiful. In all the arts there is a physical component which can no longer be considered or treated as it used to be, which cannot remain unaﬀected by our modern knowledge and power. For the last twenty years neither matter nor space nor time has been what it was from time immemorial.

In his 1936 essay “the Work of art in the age of Its technological repro- ducibility” Walter Benjamin elaborates on the loss of what he terms the “aura” of a work of art once it becomes technologically reproducible. What is at stake in a technological reproduction, according to Benjamin, is the authen- ticity of the original which is no longer present in its imitation, as he states: “In even the most perfect reproduction, one thing is lacking: the here and now of the work of art—its unique existence in a particular place. It is this unique existence—and nothing else—that bears the mark of the history to which the work has been subject” (103). While the attendees of the “Super- natural” convention are not technological, identical reproductions of Sam and Dean, they do, in a similar manner as outlined with regard to the tech- nologically reproduced wor…",

The work, Benjamin argues, loses the “aura” of sacredness that originally lent itself to religious and exhibition functions, and it is increasingly drawn into a wide range of everyday, political, and social uses. Second, as the functions of these works change, bringing them into greater proximity with a wider range of social activities, so too the mode by which they are perceived and valued by the audience changes. Benjamin argues that rather than sacred awe or absorbed aesthetic contemplation, technically reproducible works – especially those, like film, for which the technology is an intrinsic part of the medium – are perceived in a “mode of distraction,” as backgrounds or elements of other collectively performed activities. Third, this transformation of the function of art into a collective practice of percep-",

According to Hansen, by the time of his highly influential 1936 essay called “The Work of Art in the Age of Its Mechanical Reproduction,” Benjamin had largely dropped the occult and demonic associations of the term and come to speak of it as irremediably in decay. Aura was not to be understood as an eternal value bearing the unchanging meaning of an object but rather as the manner in which it can mean something for a contemporary public, inseparable from the historically changing ways of its reception. 16.

He focused on the impact that this was having on shaping public opinion. The media was pushing the aes- thetics of Fascism and the propaganda of Communism.

They tell a story, for one thing, a story about the life and death of an architectural form, about the entrance of the artist into the marketplace and into the cycles of class warfare, about the technological and administrative transformation of the modern city, about the dream life of an epoch as manifest in its cultural products, most generally about the interpenetration of past and present in the field of the 'dialectical image'.

For plausible reasons, the Artwork essay has been understood-and has been used-as both condensation and emblem of what Benjamin's ad- mirers find most typical of his intellectual style: a familiarity with, and active interest in, the cultural phenomena of his own time; an awe- inspiring depth of historical knowledge; a fascination with \"facts\" in all of their factual bluntness; a passion for the joy of speculation re- mindful of the great protagonists of German Idealism; a commitment to political causes of the Left that does not narr…",

Photography ‘can bring out aspects of the original that are accessible only to the lens (which is adjustable and can easily change viewpoint) but not to the human eye’. Further, it can ‘use certain processes, such as enlargement or slow motion, to record images which escape natural optics altogether’.18 As such, Benjamin’s discussion of the decay of aura as a result of mechanical reproduction was not primarily a melancholic musing on decay and loss, but a hint at the aura’s possible manifestations in new media.

Here, something analogous must be done for the nineteenth century, but with greater distinct- ness” (Arcades, 459; n1a, 2). A greater distinctness is made apparent by the fragmentary state of this work. More than any of Benjamin’s other works, the Arcades Project poses the question of how to read Benjamin.

Walter Benjamin’s notion of “aura” represents the awe-inspiring singularity encountered traditional art. So is mechanical reproduction without singularity and therefore artless? This doesn’t appear to be true, considering the body of digitally derived works which are now internationally acclaimed as new media art. But digital technology does take mechanical reproduction to an effortless extreme, further hiding the singularity of art, despite the fact that this singularity is what delineates the individual human existence.

By iconoclastically altering a reproduction of the Mona Lisa and, to use another example, by exhibiting a mass-produced urinal as a fountain sculpture, Marcel Duchamp succeeded in destroying what Benjamin called the traditional art work’s aura, that aura of authenticity and uniqueness that constituted the work’s distance from life and that required contemplation and immersion on the part of the spectator. In another essay, Benjamin himself acknowledged that the intention to destroy this aura was already inherent in the artistic practices of Dada.13 The destructi…",

Indeed, it was the advent of modernization itself that brought about our sensitivity to the aura. Modern shock and fragmentation constituted the aura as a problem precisely through making us realize that it is what the present lacks. At the center of Benjamin’s readings of such key modernist authors as Baudelaire, Kafka, Proust, and Brecht (of whom he was a personal friend) is the notion of modern experience being conditioned by the decay of the aura. Authentic aura, represented by the masterpieces of the past constituting high culture, was threatened by modern techniques of mechanical reproduction, which could reproduce the art object in multiple copies, making it a commodity like any other in mass culture. But, Benjamin also reasoned, there might be revolutionary potential waiting to be unlocked in new forms of communica-",

What Benjamin leaves out of his argument is the possibility that a mechanically produced object such as a toy (a material corollary to a mechanically reproduced image), through the acquisition of “history” by handling (Tzara’s patina), might be reinvested with “aura” because the desire it awakens reactivates a ritualistic function.

Two essential insights come together here: first, that it is not in and of themselves that works of art have their effect but rather that this effect is decisively determined by the institution within which the works function; second, that modes of reception must be based in social history: the perception of aura, for example, in the bourgeois individual. (1984: 30-31) Bürger credits Benjamin with explaining how the relationship between art and audience develops over time, referring specifically to Benjamin’s conceptualization of the aura in “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1936) and “On Some Motifs in Baudelaire” (1939).

In a sense Benjamin is a mirror image of Ruskin. Against Ruskin’s attempts to save art for God Benjamin proclaims the end of the aura of the work of art, an end bound up with technical reproducibility. It is perhaps simply that Benjamin celebrates what Ruskin has intuited, that mechanical reproduction techniques have a close relationship with the Death of God, and the triumph of nihilism, not least because they engage with contingency and time (Ruskin, though some twenty-five years older than Nietzsche, died in the same year, 1900. Both also had succumbed to mental illness almost completely by 1889). At the same time Ruskin also perhaps intuited something else; that the Death",

In his 1936 essay, “The Artwork in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility,” Benjamin describes aura as an effect of the authority of singular works of bourgeois art. The translation, as it were, of the authority of older sacral art into the categories of bourgeois art (autonomy, organic wholeness, genius, originality, authenticity), aura produces the feeling of an “irreducible distance” between the spectator and the work.6 In reworking this metaphor in the 1939 “On Some Motifs in Baudelaire,” Benjamin significantly shifts the ground introduction / 5",

      "text": "BENJAMIN, WALTER contemplation of traditional works of art leads to one's absorption by the art work, the shock effect of cinema, grounded in the continual change of images, allows one to absorb the work, albeit in a state of distraction. As with architecture, the audience's response is at once tactile and absent-minded. Benjamin thus proposes the formation of a politically active and critical audience through the disruption and shock of a montage of cinematic images. The Arcades Project is Benjamin's impressionistic and fragmentary study of nineteenth-century Paris (Benjamin 1973a, 1999c). Benjamin is concerned with ephemeral nature of modernism, and particularly with the modern city. The Parisian arcades transform experience of space and social relationships. Again, while more accessible in its writ- ten style than the early study of baroque drama, it is perhaps again best …",

Just as Taut, in his anarcho-utopian treatise Die Auflösung der Städte (The Dissolution of the Cities) called for a resettlement of the earth on a new basis,14 so too Scheerbart, in his 1914 treatise Glass Architecture – which also featured in Benjamin’s exposé for the Arcades Project – had seen building in glass as the promised end of the industrial brick city as it had been constructed up to the present. Thus, in a section of Glass Architecture captioned “The transformation of the Earth’s surface,” Scheerbart struck a prophetic note: So many ideas constantly sound to us like a fairy-tale, when they are not really fantastic or utopian at all.

On the other hand, the time consciousness articulated in avant-garde art is not simply ahistorical; it is directed against what might be called a false normativity in history. The modem, avant-garde spirit has sought to use the past in a different way; it disposes those pasts which have been made available by the objectifying scholarship of historicism, but it opposes at the same time a neutralised history which is locked up in the museum of historicism. Drawing upon the spirit of Surrealism, Walter Benjamin constructs the relationship of modernity to history in what I would call a posthistoricist attitude. He reminds us of the self-understanding of the French Revolution: 'The Revolution cited ancient Rome, just as fashion cites an antiquated dress. Fashion has a scent for what is current, whenever this moves within the thicket of what was once.' This is Benjamin's concept",

These machines were able to be used for analytical purposes by slowing down the playback speed to reproduce for human ears sounds previously unable to be notated. The gramophone and phonograph, when used as a talking machine, were able to allow slow-motion studies of single sounds that were previously unavailable.

For him, the `instantaneous recording process' of the photograph sets it apart from the painting; the camera's `penetrative vision' (1987: 30) gives it access to the `basic reality' of the photographer's subjects, beyond that which the painter might capture. Interestingly, however, the photograph is also offered as a protection against this reality. Confirming McGrath's view of the fetishistic quality of his photographs, Weston adds that `the beholder may find the created image more real and comprehensible than the actual object' (Weston 2003: 107). The debate about photography's relationship with art characterised the beginnings of modernity. For Walter Benjamin, famously, the photograph's reproducibility meant the destruction of the `aura' of the work of art, so that photography represents `the first truly revolutionary means of reproduction' (1999: 218).

Between 1927 to 1933, Benjamin made more than eighty broadcasts over the new medium, working at stations in Berlin and Frankfurt. Some of these performances were given in the form of Ho¨rmodelle (listening models, or radio models); some were commissioned speciﬁcally for Berlin radio’s Jugendstunde or the Stunde der Jugend on Su¨dwestdeutschen Rund- funks in Frankfurt.4 In either instance, perhaps all the more so for the latter given the directed speciﬁcity of its target audience, the issue of programming—of culture as (pre)programmed—asserts some force and sway. In the extant manuscripts of his radio addresses, including those performed for children, Benjamin can hardly be said to presume a deﬁni- tion of his addressee (‘‘children’’) or …",

      "text": "84 Walter Benjamin on Radio the playful appropriation of technology in Grandville’s imagery represents the ‘‘enthronement of the commodity, with its glitter of distractions.’’ The transformation of the world, including its cosmological forms of appearance, into familiar scenes of such enthronement is, Benjamin argues, the secret theme of Grandville’s art. Whence the split between its utopian and cynical elements in his work. The subtle artiﬁces with which it repre- sents inanimate objects correspond to what Marx calls the ‘‘theological ni- ceties’’ of the commodity. The concrete expression of this is clearly found in the spe´cialite´—a category of goods which appears at this time in the luxu- ries industry. World exhibitions construct a universe of specialties.
