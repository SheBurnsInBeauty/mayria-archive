creatures.” In place of such figurations, “which abstract the human from the material realm and obscure differentials of responsibility and harm,” Alaimo proposes a model of “the Anthropocene subject as immersed and enmeshed in the world.” She deploys her own notion of “trans-­corporeality” as a way to make sense of a variety of different engagements with the geological, all of which “conceptualize humans as enmeshed with something as rigid as a rock.” Like Huffer, Alaimo finds shells and fossils to be powerful figures for an anthropocene femi- nism, although her archive is the ocean itself and the shell-­destroying acidification it has suffered under human intervention. Unlike the spec- tacular terrestrial impacts of climate change, for example, underwater biochemical changes can only be made legible by imaginative forms of scientific and aesthetic mediation, such as those inv…

in practice—how it manifests in the text’s formal characteristics and in its content. The text’s fragmentary form, its use of allusions, and the way it figures writing as a form of queer family-making help the text to achieve its communicative goals. Throughout the chapter, my most important interlocutors (other than Nelson) are writers and thinkers with whom Nelson herself engages in The Argonauts: Wittgenstein, Barthes, and Irigaray, as well as Judith Butler, Adam Phillips, Eve Sedgwick, and Donald Winnicott. This is a deliberate decision. It serves partly as a way of better understanding Nelson’s relationship with these thinkers but also stems from the desire to consider literature and theory (a categorical distinction that The Argonauts blurs) alongside each other, rather than one above the other. In their different modes, genres, and disciplinary

The Argonauts illustrates a redemptive hybridity via its auto-theoretical monologue on being Maggie Nelson; a woman, writer, academic, mother, and lover/partner in a relationship with her transgender partner Harry, while also being human; exemplifying desires and choices that are embodied by humans across spectrums. Nelson and her partner are the Argonauts re-defining love while being worked on by love’s past, present, and future-common attributes. But Nelson’s Argo is also in relation to the/her ‘self’, “…we develop, even in utero, in response to a flow of projections and reflections ricocheting off us. Eventually, we call that snowball a self (Argo)” (Nelson 2015b, p. 95). In an interview with Silverblatt, Nelson says that no existing name for her writing will do, hence she applies the most suitable term, ‘autotheory’. Hers is a hybrid approach to practice and semantics: one name needs changing while

environment, and to connect present-day occurrences with past events. These different uses come together in the episode in which Mimi, her eyes misting over with tears at the thought of the suffering that Aurélie and Philippa endured in the past, remembers that ‘It was a misty morning when Philippa had first come to the cove’ (p. 21). Mist is further associated with the visits that Aurélie pays to the menhirs and the visions they inspire in her. The impression that Légende gives of a continuum of woman-identified experience connecting two generations of women is accentuated by the spiralling structure of the narrative and by the strategies of repetition that Allard introduces. Key events, such as Philippa’s arrival on the Brittany coast, are recounted from more than one perspective, while the situation of Mimi, the representative of the present generation, frequently echoes tha…

husband’s behavior, learns of his sadness. Amadé, by the power of the red flower of Adesange, the islanders’ god of fire and life, revives the star- woman. After this, when her sadness coincides with a full moon, she goes to the seashore to be swallowed by Manjiku. Manjiku swallows her but casts her onto the seashore. His spell is broken and when Amadé opens her eyes, she sees a gentleman standing by her side. In “Serafine I” and “Serafine II,” we see that Serafine talks about her island and brings images of the island into her stories to Miranda and Xanthe. Talking about the island as a place where she was born, lived, and left her daughter behind to come with Anthony Everard and Kit to England acts as a life force for her. Moreover, it empowers her in the family. Serafine reminds us of Sycorax, with Korkmaz believing that Serafine’s voice is actually “the continuum of Sycror…

else; someone who feels a strong longing to have a child even in the face of anti- reproductive queer theories; a woman who has never been more pro-choice as when she was pregnant. That the words ‘radical’ and ‘comrade’ are not enough for Nelson is perhaps then no surprise. They are bound to dogma and the fantasy of a single attack, one in which the unity of the attackees is apparent both within and without. Her favouring of openness is in some ways an attempt to undo both the radical and the comrade. It is a position that will change, a slipperiness that cannot be pinned, and a series of possibilities that will not be aligned or ironed out by participation within a very specifically directed collective. This, importantly, has gone on to create a necessary solidarity with those who read The Argonauts. In an interview for The Fader, Nelson states: My experience with The Argonauts …

205 determined in accordance with a reader’s own enjoyment of the novel and, indeed, their existing knowledge of relevant topics that support the novel. Meanwhile, Maggie Nelson (2005)—despite her creative approach to retelling a narrative—is relatively explicit in her utilisation of research materials. Though they may be incorporated into the text in somewhat inventive or distinct ways, she still cites supporting books and newspaper articles, alongside which she includes details of her primary research prac­ tices, too—such as her interviews with Phil. In this area, then, Nelson (2005) demonstrates the ways in which practice-based creative research can still clarify, for a reader, the authenticity and accuracy of materials used, which is, I posit, a significant contribution to broader areas of cre­ ative writing study. Significantly, one might conclude here that somehow—either through traditional citations or through the quality of the (creative) writing—

built on non-biological kinship ties. Maggie is raised by a stepfather and then becomes the stepmother of Harry’s first son, and Harry is adopted and will become the non-biological parent of two children. In this way, The Argonauts tells a careful story about networks of queer and non-binary relationships in a North American political climate where the viability of such relationships is constantly called into question. The female body is capacious throughout The Argonauts. The vagina is capacious because it can accommodate the baby’s head (“it feels big but I feel big enough”) and because fisting leaves the author feeling “invincible and ample”.28 When the couple watch the queer art-porn film Community Action Centre, Harry is left perplexed with the absence of cock: “the cat- egory of women should be capacious enough to include it”.29 Perhaps most importantly, Nelson explores t…

produces a semblance of continuity, of having the same name, and of being composed in the same way, but only through a constant reorganisa- tion and replacement of parts. In The Argonauts, Nelson works through the tension between access to recognition and to rights—to participate in marriage, to access reproductive technologies, to make a family—and a more complex project of queer world-making. Certainly, Nelson re-­ inscribes aspects of homonormative family life.36 The couple make a living as an artist and a writer/academic, and they have access to medical services for transition and pregnancy, as well as a new baby that was “deeply, dog- gedly, wildly” wanted.37 However, The Argonauts also utilises love to cre- ate narrative possibilities for trans characters which represents a trans body as desirable and loveable, rather than as what Cael M. Keegan calls the “classical motif” …

exceeds the role allotted to her by scripture. She is the voice of com- mon sense and compassion, charting a middle way between, on the one hand, sceptics who denounce Jesus as a charlatan and, on the other, enthusiasts who worship him as the Messiah. As I noted above, much of the radical content of these novels was old news by the 1930s. Over half a century had passed since the publication in French of Renan’s Life of Jesus (1863) and the need to separate the historical Christ from the Christ of faith had been regularly asserted over the intervening period. Indeed when Lord Alfred Douglas tried to bring a prosecution against Moore for “blasphemous libel” in The Brook Kerith ( 1916 ), he received short shrift from a liberal-minded judge: “it had been held over and over again that to assert in a book that Christ was a man and not divine was not necessarily blasphemy” (“The Brook Kerith,” 1916). Borden was involved in a lawsuit of her own against the Catholic Herald

vive them. Worse still than an optimistic weathercaster would be a forecaster who actually believed their knowledge of meteorology meant they could control what happens. To pessimists, optimists have the illusion that they have mastery over their lives. We keep believing that we have the power to make our lives better, even in the face of all our failures to do so. No tech- nology, morality, or foresight protects us from death and change, and even the shiniest new toy will eventually rust (as Cohle’s name indicates). But the optimist can, in effect, multiply the damage we all will suffer by adding illusions on top of the situation. When these illusions are pierced, it adds the pain of disappointment to the more mundane pains that time inflicts by itself. So, to the pes- simist, optimism is not just blind but, to a point, dangerous. In True Detective, this optimism is embodied in Rust’s p…

This connection between romance and unthinking slavery later became a trope commonplace among radicals in the debate after the French Revolution, but for Richardson the influence of classical literature was equally questionable. Having mitigated the romance association with licentiousness, Richardson both utilized the form’s idealism and indicated its mimetic value. Like later commentators who found the rhetoric of romance a potential vehicle to describe oppression, Richardson used its motifs to depict social injury. Like Jane Austen in Northanger Abbey (1818), even while Richar…

It is some time since they have divided their own country into squares. That figure has lost the charms of its novelty. They want new lands for new trials. It is not only the geometricians of the republic that find him a good subject, the chemists have bespoken him after the geometricians have done with him. As the first set have an eye on his Grace's lands, the chemists are not less taken with his buildings.

cause she will put them to everyday use. Dee, by contrast, is not im­ mersed in tradition but views it from outside. She relates to her past through modish, secondhand ideas about blackness that she has picked up at college. She turns useful everyday things into works of art and objects of display, wrenching them out of their immediate, lived con­ text. To aestheticize something in this way, Walker's story seems to suggest, is to rob it of its soul. Readings of Walker's story have tended to support this view. Hous­ ton Baker and Charlotte Pierce-Baker, in particular, read Walker's story in starkly antithetical terms. "The stylish daughter's entire life has been one of 'framed' experience," they write; "she has always sought a fashionable 'aesthetic' distance from southern expediencies." They go on to dismiss Dee as a sellout and a fake, her phony Afrocentrism a cre­ ation of West…

The agency is her life and, as seen in her récit, we see that she takes her assignment seriously, even when it involves coming up with an exotic pseudonym to use among the other fan club members. She calls herself “Lotus pensif,” when the name “Coeur brisé” is already taken by another member (Enquêtes, 1: 979), but continues to introduce herself by her own name because she finds the pseudonym does not suit her. In the second chapter of her first récit, Hélène puts herself in danger by going to a “modeling agency” that recruits members of Gil Andréa’s fan club for its prostitution ring servicing Argentina. As it is a seedy establishment, she encounters two men in the hallway who make catcalls at her. She tells them that they could be more polite, remarking to the reader, “Ils ne me faisaient pas peur.

changing its name’”.25 Nelson connects the figure of the Argo to Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s use of the term “queer” which, she writes, designates “molten or shifting parts, a means of asserting while also giving the slip”.26 The shifting parts of the memoir include step-parenting, work arrange- ments, marriage, conception, and the birth and infancy of their child Iggy. Nelson also explores ideas about genderqueer family-making by way of A.L. Steiner’s photographic installation Puppies and Babies (2012), which assembles personal photos of pets, lovers, friends, and children, and explores modes of caretaking as something “detachable from—and attach- able to—any gender, any sentient being”.27 Furthermore, The Argonauts showcases a range of (apparently) heterosexual family structures that are built on non-biological kinship ties. Maggie is raised by a stepfather and then becomes the s…

In Nelson, Ada sports a metal ﬁnger crafted by clever George, exchanging the power of her muteness – the phallic femininity that belongs to the mythic, monumen- tal time that precedes and is outside of the social – for the minor dis- comfort of a missing digit, a physical reminder of the way in which that power has been literally as well as ﬁguratively checked by patriarchal imperatives. In losing her ﬁnger and her fetishised piano, and learning to speak, Ada becomes, in one sense, a woman like any other, a woman Retuning The Piano 139

As is apparent from the following de- scription of this fantastic creature, he is not a mechanical being but very much a living creature. A descendant of the brazen race that sprang from ash-trees, he survived the days of the demigods, and Zeus had given him to Europa to keep watch over Crete by running round the island on his bronze feet three t h e p ow e r o f t h e a u t o m at o n 15

space that would steep her in solitude and harass her with care.' Maggie later feels that the whole evening had hung together, 'as a thing appointed by some occult power that had dealt with her'. The occult power is really Maggie herself - she and her Prospero father Adam- who hums to himself as he casts his 'spell'. Maggie thinks that Amerigo might suddenly commit some mistake or some violence, to 'break the spell she had cast upon him and that the polished old ivory of her father's inattackable surface made so absolute'. And finally she has him held fixed in his place, like 'some statue of one of his forefathers'. But Amerigo is not Maggie's adversary so much as Charlotte, the rival for her father as well as her husband. In conversation with her father she sees how to settle the fate of Charlotte: 'It was a blur of light, in the midst of which she saw Charlotte like some …

its claims. Instead the manifesto and the poems explore community as a form of self-definition, turning sex into a lens for approaching creative production. Myles manages similar performances of self, with a speed of movement that is analogous to O’Hara’s. Their promotional video serves as a useful lens through which to understand this rapidity, as well as approach their posturing dykehood. Myles demonstrates an uncertainty of selfhood, all the while confidently occupying a prominent position within all of their work. Maggie Nelson, perhaps more theoretically reflective on her status as a queer writer, uses The Argonauts to discuss her relationship with language, recognizing its failure to express coherently and fully, as well as its failure to best represent the self. The queer lyric, therefore, is an important term for all four writers, even while they might deviate from the…

of the fact that the woman exists within a loveless domain, isolated and stag- nant, with no possibility of company. This goddess of spring appears out of place among the winter landscape and infertile pastures, which surround the cabin, appearing almost mocking, as it perhaps heightens the old woman’s feelings of sterility. The juxtaposition of fertility and sterility serves to illustrate the realms of being and non-being, refl ecting the woman’s state of existence. Her position of prolonged existence is not honourable, and she does not feel elevated at the prospect of continued isolation, as ‘Down on her knees especially she fi nds it hard not to remain so forever’ (ibid.). The spiritual attrition from which she suf- fers, manifests itself through her inability to coerce her physical being to move, as her mental fatigue is corresponding to her physical exhaustion. And so she r…

is to propose several things at once. It is first of all to substitute for the idea of the work of art as an organism (developing out of a past tradition, imbedded in the history of a given medium) the image of it as a structure. To illustrate this notion of structure, Roland Barthes liked to use the story of the Argonauts, ordered by the Gods to complete their long journey in one and the same ship ­ the Argo - against the certainty of the boat's gradual deterioration. Over the course of the voyage the Argonauts slowly replaced each piece of the ship, "so that they ended with an entirely new ship, without having to alter either its name or its form. This ship Argo is highly useful," Barthes continues. "It affords the allegory of an eminently structural object, created not by genius, inspira­ tion, determination, evolution, but by two modest actions (which cannot be caught up in any mystique of creation): subst£tut£on (one part replaces another,

intervenes, saying that they will no longer bother Phineus. It is Phineus who tells the Argonauts of the dangers of the Cyanean Rocks, or the Clashing Rocks. This account—of the immense cliffs that, at the Bosphorus, clash together, crushing any ships that dare attempt to make their way through them—has the flavour of a traveller’s tale, and is perhaps nothing more than a supernaturalisation of the narrowness of the strait at this juncture. The Argo manages to get through, albeit not without difficulty: “Once more the Rocks met face to face with a resounding crash, flinging a great cloud of spray into the air. The sea gave a terrific roar and the broad sky rang again. Caverns underneath the crags bellowed as the sea came surging in. A great wave broke against the cliffs and the white foam swept high above them. Argo was spun round as the flood reached her” (2.565–70). But the most intere…

of the public domain as is Keneally, and their fates are thoroughly intertwined. At the beginning of the novel, it is divulged that she has a preposterous, secret scheme, a desire to rise above her constricting social circumstances, “to rise somehow until she could see right down into the centre of things. Nothing less. But let the people who scoffed ﬁnd that out about her and there was no telling what they’d have to say about it” (13). Maggie’s ambition obviously parallels Keneally’s, and because of it she is, like Keneally, very much a central ﬁgure in the public imagination of the island. In establishing the Revelations Trailer Park – a kind of residual colony in which she strives to undo the damage caused by Keneally – Maggie denies her own needs and cultivates an atmosphere of dependency similar to that of Keneally’s reign. She gives refuge to those who have been psychically damaged by Keneally, particularly Madmother Thomas, and in a more positive and caring way presides

them, even if he is not thrilled about having to die. To be fair, he does admit, in talking about the inevitability of boredom specifically, that “None of us is immortal, so we can’t really know for sure,” but that does not keep him from a dogged attempt to demonstrate such inevitability (May 2009: 61). If there is any saving grace for the way these matters are treated on The Good Place, despite May’s involvement, it is the character Tahani. After completing her very long list of things to do in the afterlife, she declares that she is ready to walk through the doorway. However, during her farewell party, she has an epiphany about a rather difficult and compli- cated task no (former) human has ever taken on—she wants to become an afterlife architect. I suspect that, for Schur and the other principal decision- makers on the show, this is only postponing the inevitable, but because we never see the end of Tahani, it seems possible that she is the kind of person

115 Finding a Name for Possibility Maggie Nelson’s The Argonauts (2015b) combines the autobiographical with the theoretical, becoming ‘autotheory’, which she discusses with Michael Silverblatt (2015). Named after Barthes’s ship builders and heroic crew and in relation to Nelson’s appropriation of that analogy, The Argonauts is an authorial response to love’s incarnations and specific complexities. Nelson also invokes and interacts with various theoretical points of view throughout. ‘The Argonauts’ references the Greek myth which Roland Barthes discusses in his multi-media autobiography Roland Barthes ([1975] 1994). Barthes employs the anecdote of the ship, the Argo and its ‘Argonauts’ from the Greek myth of Jason and the Argonauts: a crew of heroes who sailed on the ship named Argo4 in pursuit of the ‘Golden Fleece’ (the taking of which would bring utmost authority and grandeur). Barthes uses the image as an illustration of the idea that

possibilities that are accessed through reader interaction with the text. This, she describes as “what if” unrealized possibilities. These possibilities, she notes, are stimulated not only by choice, but “also by the characters’ own speculations about what might happen in the future” (301). As evidence, Willem mentions a scene in the text where Fortuna is conversing with Mau- rica about escaping Juanito’s plan to seduce her, while Maurica describes her boredom and constant contact with her small circle of acquaintances that could lead Fortuna to “have an affair with the mayor, the doctor, the judge, or even the priest of the town” (302). Because “this portrayal in no way exhausts all the possibilities of small town life, the reader is left to imagine others, including ones that could yield positive results instead” (302). Unquestionably, the idea of sideshadowing allows for the expansion…

brother Tom. When she had floated down the stream with Stephen Guest (set off from the community by his name) her will was in abey- ance. At the end she is endowed with a kind of natural freedom. The chapter is entitled 'The Final Rescue' and the uneasiness which many readers feel with the conclusion is, I think, hinted at defensively in that address from author to reader: it is George Eliot who rescues Maggie from the grim, cramped future that the social detenninism of the plot has seemed to make inescapable. George Eliot chose always to imprison her most favoured women - Dinah, Maggie, Dorothea. She does not allow them to share her own extraordinary flight, her escape from St Oggs and from Middlemarch. She needs them to endure their own typicality. But at the end of The Mill her obduracy fails. She allows to Maggie the fulftlment of an infantile, passionate, incestuous recovery of love: 'In their death they were not divided.' The solution exceeds the book's terms because

that the breakdown of the family serves as a punishment for their desire for happiness. Despite David’s attempts to show Harriet that her thought processes are more at home in the 16th century witch trials than in 20th century suburbia, she is now at the mercy of the secondary curse, where the superego comprises entirely the persecutory phantasies of the primary curse. David notices that Har­ riet’s masochistic imagination is also redolent of the malevolent gods of the archaic unconscious, yet as he becomes increasingly desperate, he also begins to waiver and have similar persecutory thoughts that someone or something has it in for them. The couple fail to see that these same arcane and cruel gods are those trolls and goblins of deep time that they have located in Ben. Their continuing disowned ag­ gression and inability to mourn their ideal child leads to a persecutory guilt from which they cannot recover. Ben, as the ‘weird child’ par excellence, is fated to

age, rank, and marital status, who enter into a two day conversation with one another, first about who is more worthy and virtuous men or women, and second about various topics in what can only be described as natural history. While the work is couched as a debate about the relative merits of the sexes, the discussion ends up being rather lopsided, and threatens to degenerate into an harangue against men. It nevertheless does exhibit women’s capacity for argument: those charged to defend men present reasons in their defense, but these are rebutted by the women charged with defending women. Moreover, reading the work as simply polemical cannot explain the scientific enterprise of the second day. It seems rather that the rather frank and open discussion of the first day, in which the women validate their own worth, while denigrating the way men have represented the female sex, sets up, and…

He reminds his father that if Antigone dies, her death will be followed by another. Haimon believes Antigone’s action is honorable. Finally, Teiresias is a blind soothsayer. He foresees Creon’s mistake and advises him against it, warning the king about impending calamity. Creon rejects Teiresias’ advice to set Antigone free. Antigone and Creon are both stuck in their defective sight that stops them from seeing each other’s sense of justice. The righteousness that they each feel in relation to the burial entails blame for the other. They can see the strict logic of their own reasoning, but do not leave space for the full picture. They become tragic characters. The problem is crystallized in their dispute about Polynices’ burial: Creon believes himself to be pro…

Bergthaller proposes that Atwood questions the role “language, literature and, more generally, the human propensity for symbol-​ making can play in our attempts to deal with the ecological crisis” (729). By granting them writing or symbol-​making, Toby allows the Crakers the tools that will enable them to deal with their own ecological crisis as it arises, leav­ ing the reader to speculate on how they will do that, and whether they will follow in the footsteps of their creator or be able to forge a new way of living. Toby gives the Crakers more than writing. She gives them an “origin story,” almost in opposition to Haraway’s cyborg who “has no origin story in the West­ ern sense” (Reader 9). Haraway…

Lockwood describes her as a “canine mother” (6), “bitch” (6), “madam” (7), and “Juno,” the mother of the gods (10). Lockwood further stresses her maternity by observing she has just left “her nursery” and has “little ones” (6, 10). The dog is watchful over and combative toward Lockwood, having “guardianship over all [his] movements” and revealing “white teeth” under a “curled up” lip (6). Similarly, Cathy “stare[s]” at Lockwood: “She kept her eyes on me, in a cool, regardless manner” (10). She also “curled her lip” (30).

The ineffec- tiveness of the barring arder would be a laugh if it were not so tragic. As her outraged husband creates a ruckus outside the house, day and night, she juggles the desire not to upset the children any more with the shame of having to ask the neighbours to call the guards and with the dread of another beating if she lets him in. The amount of her supplementary welfare allowance is another sick joke - in no way does it allow her to cope on her own.

has been raised in some relatively wild and uncultivated place, per­ haps among American Indians (Bage's Herms prong) or in the W est Indies (Cumberland's Belcour), or nearer home, in Wales (God­ win's Fleetwood), or the Highlands of Scotland (Beattie's Edwin or Norval in Home's Douglas). In any case, he is always depicted as a being close to nature and to natural life, and this association has given him moral principles and love and natural generosity, and has developed his innately acute sensibilities. These natural sensibilities become more tender and sentimental as the century progresses, un­ til some Children of Nature (Godwin's Fleetwood, for instance) refuse to hunt or fish because they cannot stand to harm their animal friends. Their love of natural scenery runs usually to the sublime ­ nature in her wilder or more formidable aspects. In appearance the Child of Nature is handsome, of course, but with none of the effem­

 ■ Richard Kearney make of strangers that arrive out of the blue, walk in from the desert, and knock at our door in the middle of the night? And in this regard, carnal hermeneutics may be said to have two patron saints—the god Hermes and the dog Argos. For if Hermes, messenger of the gods, discloses hermetic cyphers from above, Argos brings animal savvy from below. Th e former, masked as a migrant, revealed himself to Baucis and Philomen as, arriving from nowhere, he “tasted” their gift of food. Th e latter, Argos, deployed canine ﬂ air in recognizing his master, Odysseus, when he returned to Ithaca disguised as a beggar. In both cases we witness fundamental forms of “tact” in the discerning of strangers; and ﬁ nd a reminder that we often need animal or divine messengers to get us back in touch with ourselves. What is true of Greek wisdom is equally true of biblical and other cul- tures. Th e inaugural act of Abrahamic discernment is, let us not forget, a

of the features of high monster culture, belonging in spirit with Dindymus, king of the cave dwelling Bragmanni, and sharing the remote or uncivilized habitat of many of the monsters in Western European narratives. Five of these chapters, those of Steel, Van Duzer, Strickland, Felton and Davies, bring the reader up to date on the Western European traditions of Plinean monstrous races of men originating in classical antiquity, as well as on the fortunes of the largely Roman tradition of monstrous individual births and their significance for the city or the nation. In the early modern period these monsters by birth had a new life in sectarian religious controversy. Felton, Steel and Davies’s chapters chart the development of monsters from the ancient Greeks through the age of the Desert Fathers and beyond into the Middle Ages and early modern period. It is primarily out of this tradition t…

suggesting otherwise, and reconsiders Helle’s tales of her mother (revealed to have come from a book of short stories) in light of Helle’s dichotomy between invention and discovery, female and male: “Looked at through this lens, wild Ida, perched on her hillock, could be seen as the inevitable result of a daughter’s need to invent a mother consistent with her vision of the truth” (38). Ida dies when Helle is still a child; Helle becomes an artist, a great composer, and, as discussed in the previous chapter, her art is thoroughly imbued with the influence and spirit of her mother—but which mother, the fictional, romanticized figure of the wild gypsy, or the real daughter of a respectable burgher? Here Davis suggests that as much as Ida has influenced Helle, Helle in turn has created Ida as the figure from which she needs to be descended. Further, Helle is convinced that she has…

Her construction of a messy, absent- minded, irresponsible identity allows her to bring home the ‘two tins of caviar and a box of fancy crackers and a half bottle of champagne’ instead of the items Arthur requested. Her lie about the sale echoes her other secret lin- guistic constructions – her Gothic novels – the income from which ironically paid for the champagne and caviar! Her ability to do ‘something complicated and dangerous without making a single mistake’ indicates that her inabilities were strategic rather than real. However, her repeated desire for ‘Arthur to know how clever I’d been’ indicates that at this stage in the novel she has not escaped from his control over her identity; nor has she started to question his value system.

fants, where they were miraculously (and improbably) saved by a goat and a sheep who nursed them, thus paving the way for their adoption into rustic herding families and subsequent romance. Like the costumed gods in Amphitryon, the protagonists embody the novel’s broader intersection of social ranks, which features slaves alongside their noble masters. The novel portrays the evolution of the protagonists’ relationship from initial attraction to marriage and consummation, with its depiction of two characters who feel the effects of love but must still learn its name recalling the linguistic ambi‑ guity of Cratylus and Amphitryon. Their romance is facilitated by the satyr Pan, whose prominence is appropriate to his status as ruler of the pastoral realm. The assistance he provides to the protagonists belies his violent behavior in the novels’ three inset aetiologies and his revised c…

children. Each area, a discrete and organic network of life, is the adversary of the other; each is jealous of its territory and dominion. For Douglas, each domain represents a different set of values, each with a powerful sanction allying him to its laws and conditions of existence. In town he participates in rites and ceremonies of the kind already discussed but which are ordained by adults. There he is a subject bound by the restraints of civilization, by an order he had nothing to do with creating. Bradbury makes us privy to his activities in the fellowship of parents and townspeople.

Mr. Skee’s Stetson had, as a matter of fact, no sign of plumage, and his bows were of a somewhat jerky order; but his gallantry was sweeping and impressive, none the less. If he remained too far away Mrs. St. Cloud would draw him to her circle, which consisted of all the other gentlemen. There were two exceptions. Mr. James Saunders had reached the stage where any woman besides Susie was but a skirted ghost, and Morton was by this time so deeply devoted to Vivian that he probably would not have wavered even if left alone. He was not wholly a free agent, however. Adela St. Cloud had reached an age when something must be done. Her mysterious absent husband had mysteriously and absently died, and still she never breathed a word against him. But the Bible Class in Bainville furnished no satisfactory material for fu…

I should slowly move that hotel, those hotels you wander through during the night like a lost stranger. I, who dream of mercurial ships on their way to some place, both loved and hated. Ships that glide among other ships, filled with passengers who do not know the way, who are unacquainted with their destiny. I have come to love those ships. Only because of their familiarity. Only because they appear in my dreams, still as stones, amid silver- gray seas. "Are they fleeing?" asks Aida. "No;' I answer. They are not ghost ships; rather, I think they are carrying ghostly passengers who have lost all sense of time and of space. As I have. Hypnotized by my contemplation of Aida, I am a man from nowhere, from no particular time at all, a man enclosed in a museum, gazing at the prints that other men, anxious to set

26 SHAKESPEARE AND PHILOSOPHY demonstrates immediately that he misunderstands love (or seeks Portia only as a prize or meal ticket). Headed for matrimonial Palookaville, Arragon spurns the gold casket because the desires of the masses are unworthy. If the multi- tudes desire something then Arragon is suspicious of the value of that some- thing. The masses are fools and he who follows their judgments is doomed to mediocrity. Arragon selects the silver casket because it distributes social goods on the basis of personal desert. Arragon is convinced that his merit glis- tens.

It is another mythological object, a cinematic object, producible only on film. As Aunt Patsy has provided the locale for their conclusion she will provide Lucy's costume for it, a silk nightgown that Lucy is shown to tuck and tie up somehow so that it fits her.

previously by someone of greater authority than Antigone. Like this essay, Antigone relies upon her authorities for her authority. She wants to do what she wants to do. (For here lies the “else” wherein lies her comedic register.) Like any lawyer, she wants precedent. Whereas Lacan posited Antigone as the one who never cedes her desire, it seems in Carson that desire is, in this sense, not for this or that, but for that. That being the something wanting, not for the something bigger, the Law beyond the law, as is usually suggested, but for something much smaller—the law beyond the Law beyond the law. The stupid and singular love that proves the loveliness of love itself. If we suspend our moral approbation of the contingent locus of Antigone’s desire (to bury her brother) and look at it with a full sense of its perversion (for Lacan, the pervert is the one who claims to know the b…

for the various kinds of social experience associated with them. In the passage above, for instance, Melville confl ates the two most common uses of “coun- try” by invoking nation-states (“in other countries” or “Europeans”) alongside rural domains (“the country [rather than the city] as their home”). By con- trasting the pastoral and the metropolitan in terms of where the wealthy or the “fi nest families” live and of what the poets and philosophers say, Melville also suggests a constellation of space, power (political and economic), and his- tory. Pierre’s Saddle Meadows affords an exemplary model of both the aristo- cratic European estate and the ideological Americanist mini-republic. For the Glendinning family seems emblematic of “Americanness.” Notwithstanding the rhetoric of revolutionary American nationalism, which tended to empha- size the forward-looking movement and general paucity of moldering old

topic, ‘left little trace of their own existence’ (a lot of examples are taken by necessity from funeral urns).16 Hence my focus on drama, which has survived more or less intact and where different versions of motherhood, for better or worse, could be tried out for size, admittedly written by men. My engagement with classical culture on the subject of mothers has left me alternately cheering and tearing my hair (although, as we will see, by the time I have finished the two responses start to coalesce). In Euripides’ The Suppliant Women, Aethra pleads with her son Theseus to be allowed to speak on behalf of the Argive mothers whose fallen sons lie unburied. The play can be read as a mother- centred version of the better-known Antigone, whose more famous heroine insists on her brother’s sacred right to due burial against unjust man-made law. In The Suppliant Women, Aethra makes her plea, n…

There are women in that factory who make twenty-five dozen earthenware pots every day. There are mothers in the Mile End Road who depend upon the farthings which those women earn. But there are employers in Surrey who are even now smoking rich cigars while the nightingale sings. Burning with indignation, stuVed with information, arraigning civilization, Mr Galsworthy would only see in Mrs Brown a pot broken on the wheel and thrown into the corner.

In contrast to the torches on MacPherson’s sarcophagus, which were directed towards the ground indicating memento mori, the Beckers stela depicts a torch which points upwards, and accented by the wavy pattern of the torch’s fire; this is accompanied by the inscription ‘VOORLICHTING’ (meaning information, education, or counseling in Dutch), thus underscor­ ing the interpretation of the torch, not as a Christian symbol, but as a symbol of Enlightenment and social activism. The headstone’s main inscription con­ nects this iconographic element to biographical information: Beckers was a civil servant concerned with the protection of workers’ rights. Under the main inscription we find the wreath, with another inscription revealing that the stela was erected by the deceased’s friends.

On the way, in one of the old coppiced woods through which the seeker-of-the-sublime must pass, it notices that the foliage is tainted, that some trees seem to be dying. The temperature is high for the time of year and, as it walks, its feet begin to swell and what were comfortable boots become uncomfortable. After a curtailed but nevertheless painful walk, it returns to its car, again frustrated. It cannot wait to put its feet up on the sofa. With luck it will catch the natural history programme on the wildlife of the Amazon rainforest. It doesn’t. This rather strained vignette marks a series of sub-relationalities. Certainly, MM can be common to the three co(a)gents. But the connections proceed not simply through MM. The initial worry of the couch potato and its transformation into a cason is partly prompted by sunshine. The sunshine entails a fragment of agency and identity from the seeker-of-the-sublime.

as her only chance for artistic freedom. And Terence Diggory analyzes the need for "slant" for camouflage, for protective costume—that distinguishes the powerful and theatrical poetry of Dickinson (and her contemporary heiresses, like Plath) from a male tradition of "nakedness" best exemplified by Whitman. The title of our third section, "The Silver Reticence," refers to the lin- guistic compression that Jeanne Kammer considers a crucial characteristic of modernist poetry by women. Discussing this device and the ellipses and "diaphors" associated with it, Kammer explores the absences and silences in the poetry of such important foremothers a^ Dickinson, H.D., and Marianne Moore. All of the other essays in this part of the book also deal in one way or another with female reticence as a subject or a strategy. Gloria T. Hull, for example, traces the complex poetic tradition of black women in America, examining in particular the comparatively little-known work that women

who has run away from the rest of her family and is on the road, driving west. Bennie is a hitchhiker who sings all the time: "Songs of true love, false love, redemption; songs of unreasonable joy.... Mavis sang along once in a while, but mostly she listened..." (34). The "gorgeous ache" is not what Ben- nie's voice possesses, or not necessarily. It is what Mavis hears in it, what Mavis misses when Bennie is gone. More precisely, it is what Mavis would call it if she had such words. It is a name for what she cannot name, the sound of an experience turning into a regret, an absence. Of course there may be an ache behind the ache in Bennie's voice, the force of Bennie's own real pain, but the adjective "gorgeous" pulls us emphatically away from that. The second woman is Sweetie, mother of four extremely sick children, who seem never to have had a moment's health. Her own mind is stretched

the most part, favorably portrayed, which signifies Maturin’s favoring of the epigenetic, the scientific. Like the Scottish male midwives and obstetri- cians of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Adonijah stands outside traditional English Protestant culture while simultaneously representing scientific progress and life. He lives in a room reminiscent of John Hunter’s museum and spends his days resurrecting dead identities through narra- tive. Victor Sage explains that the “link between the embedded narrative and frame tale is portrayed as a kind of resurrection” (Melmoth, 302, 636n8). Koelb argues that the Adonijah section of the novel is a powerful revivification through reading/writing that emphasizes the unnatural rela- tionship between life and death: “The manuscript’s physical character, its location, and the circumstances in which Alonzo reads it all contribute to an atmosphere of death so powerful that the narrative it contains cannot

handsome pension. Unsurprisingly, François chooses the latter option, but he is astounded to find that his colleagues who have agreed to stay on under the new terms (i.e., conversion) are paid a salary three times higher than the previous prevailing wage, are housed in elegant apartments on the Boule- vard Saint-Germain, and, most important, are promised wives from among their students. Like all of Houellebecq’s protagonists, François is a religious anemic. The idea that he might become a believer of any sort strikes him not so much as undesirable but as simply impossible. Not until the election of Ben Abbes does he give any serious consideration to religious matters: “For the first time in my life I had begun thinking about God, seriously envisioning the idea of a Creator of the Universe, who watched over each of my acts, and my first reaction was very definite: it was none …

way) his job. He then became intrigued by the mystery of Julie’s disappear- ance, fell in love with the idea of her, and eventually found the object of his quest. Once he is fired, his decision to follow the investigation is his own. After searching Julie’s apartment, he hangs up his hat—­a symbolic removal of the superficial Earth culture he emulates and a return to his authentic Belter self—­and he commits to his quest to find the real Julie. Before leav- ing, he brings Julie’s necklace as a token with him (like a good quest-­hero). Then, the show gives us the irony of a Belter who hates space buying a ticket for a voyage into the infinity outside. On the transport to Eros, Miller has a conversation with a Mormon missionary who has joined the 100-­year expedition on the ship that Fred Johnson is building for them (soon to be renamed the Behemoth). Miller asks him, “Nobody real…

that he can only marry a Catholic woman, because love is easier where there is community of ideas. Love and religion reinforce each other. Maud cannot even consider conversion, even if Jean-Louis suggests it; her family practiced irreligion as a religion, and even if she claims to be indifferent toward religion, she hates the hypocrisy connected with much of it, and which she believes she senses in Jean-Louis himself. A further reason for her antipathy is that her marriage broke apart, because both she and her husband had lovers, his being a young Catholic woman, whom she hated with all her heart, even if the sincerity of her love was undeniable. With unerring female instinct, she furthermore feels that Jean-Louis is in love with a woman who is Catholic herself.

proclaimed forcefully in the epic poem, Argonautica, written by Apollonius Rhodius in the third century BCE, which recounts the legend of the voyage of Jason and the Argonauts to retrieve the Golden Fleece from Colchis. The desperate and obsessive love of Medea for Jason is what transforms her physi- cally and emotionally, leading to ruin and tragedy11: Her heart fell from out her bosom, and a dark mist came over her eyes, and a hot blush covered her cheeks. And she had no strength to lift her knees back- wards or forwards, but her feet beneath were rooted to the ground; and mean- time all her handmaidens had drawn aside. So they two stood face to face without a word, without a sound, like oaks or lofty pines, which stand quietly side by side on the mountains when the wind is still; then again, when stirred by the breath of the wind, they murmur ceaselessly; so they two were destined to tell out all their tale, stirred by the breath of Love.

planned site of a new road from Jabiru through Kakadu National Park and Abo- riginal sacred land, Jug had responded that he was obliged to do this road build- ing because it was his livelihood, claiming his working-class status for argument. In that pre-epiphanic time his ethic extended no farther than his own family's survival; that is, until he found out just how large that family was. Maggie, the character whose point of view governs the story, begins to take the reader over the line between the dualistic European way of seeing nature versus alleged "civilization" and the Aborigine's holistic view of human beings' relation to nature and to each other. This transition passage explains "what was impossible about Melbourne She couldn't bear to expose her perfectly ordi- nary strangeness, her loony family's ordinary Darwin madness, to people who knew so very little" (397).

Mike was on a lot of the trips represented by photographs in this book. He liked early mornings in winter only, and I was just about the only other crazy guy that would get up on a winter morning and make photographs. We were a good match. Ted also merits special thanks: not only is he my brother-in-law but he introduced me to the road trip. We started our road trips together back in the 1980s. I credit Ted with getting me going in a serious way on my personal work. I want to thank others in the fields of fine art and photography who always encouraged me. The endeavor of fine art photography is in special need of encouragement, because truly many are called and few are chosen. Among the chosen are Cheryl Y…

New York to study poetry directly under Myles. This has ultimately resulted in a close friendship between the two poets, with Nelson serving as the executor of Myles’ literary estate. In a 2016 interview with The New York Times, Myles says, ‘I’ve known Maggie Nelson for 20 years. That’s totally what the poetry world is, is those kind of relationships’ (Correal 2016). This seems to suggest that the poetry world of Nelson and Myles is not that dissimilar to the groups of artists and writers with whom Stein and O’Hara interacted. As my previous paragraph demonstrates, Nelson has critical investments in the New York School that range beyond her creative practice. Investigating the poetics, style and postures of the New York School, Nelson traces influence as far back as Stein, before turning to O’Hara, ultimately considering Mayer, Notley and Myles. She tracks a lineage of ‘not ca…

insightful. Arbitrariness per se is not a problem – it is a challenge to narrate odd, thrown-together co(a)gents that do not follow the sorts of recipes that characterize the co(a)gents I have exploited here. The adventure is to see whether these thrown-together co(a)gents yield new, interesting, unexpected sub-relationalities and patterns that contribute to, and draw upon, other networks, bigger string figures, grander hybrids, and thus illuminate in useful ways the associations, contingencies and coincidences used in these latter assemblages. As we might expect, there is no guarantee that the yield of insight will match the effort of invention. My attempts at articulating a way of thinking about heterogeneity and distributedness, and my efforts to fashion some theoretical tools that might aid in this thinking, have been worked through a number of case studies. These case studies were, for good reasons (see Chapter 1), structured around personal
