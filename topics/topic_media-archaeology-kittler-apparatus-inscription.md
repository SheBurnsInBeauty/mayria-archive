from poetry to music and mathematics and from the arts to science and the senses. For Kittler, the Greek alphabet becomes an exemplary medium at the centre of a logic to which all technological innovation returns, including the universal code of digital computing. It is less a symbolic system preoccupied with meaning and more an indexical medium that, like phonography and photography, records forms. By relating writing to spoken language, and by situating the Greek alphabet at the origins of a history for the realistic, accurate reproduction of sound, Kittler turns it into a system whose signiﬁcance lies in its ability to transmit impressions from the outside world: not to construct reality or represent reality, but to present it, giving direct access to it. Verity Platt (Chapter 3: ‘The Seal of Polycrates: A Discourse on Dis- course Channel Conditions’) argues for the centrality in Greek culture of seals and the act of impressing, discussing numerous examples among

storage and knowledge. Not simply a cultural history of outmoded technology, this type of media archaeologist’s task is to explore the ways that technical components of media systems, through their varied history of developments, have built within them a number of implicit technical codes, protocols and ways of operating that are continually rehearsed and reﬁ ned in their contemporary use. In a sense, this is a task that involves excavating the fossils of media upon which the foundations of the contemporary have been laid. In trying to uncover these inbuilt technical codes, it is the processing of signal, as a function that, following Whitehead, is crystallized in the forms of media images, that, following Kittler, we need to direct our attention towards. But it also (to depart somewhat from Kittler’s unrelenting focus on electronics) involves a level of phenomenological analy…

centuries. In the former he makes the claim that ‘technologies like that of book printing and the institutions coupled to it, such as literature and the university, thus constituted a historically very powerful formation, which in the Europe of the age of Goethe became the condition of the possibility of literary criticism’ (369). In the latter he tells us that three technologies of inscription—the gramophone, film—and the typewrit- er, broke the monopoly of writing creating a new autonomous relation between the human and meaning as a machinic process, freeing infor- mation flow from the rigid grid of the symbolic and in so doing trans- ported Europe from a Romantic subjectivity into a modern idiom of alienation. In an arresting aphorism he notes ‘around 1880 poetry turned into literature’ (Kittler, 1999: 14). As with any such summary of a sweeping historicization I am un- able to do justice to Kittler’s archival account of this switch from

draw a coherent border between these two idioms that define so much of the history of the period that Kittler puts into analysis. In the section on the typewriter in the 1986 (1999) book, although the chapter on Nietzsche from Discourse Networks, for example, is very much a representation of similar material, Kittler proposes that the typewriter ‘inverts the material basis of literature’ (183) by nullifying handwriting and rearranging the gender relations of literature from a cadre of male poetic secretaries to a pool of female typists. As a prod- uct of war, the patent for the typewriter was lodged by Remington, an American arms manufacturer attempting to diversify its product range following the end of the Civil War. The typewriter, says Kittler, im- proved administrative efficiency and, along with celluloid and the phonograph cylinder, opened the new century onto an information age. Such a seductive narrative must necessarily operate on a certain level

way of working and representing thought and media itself. A gesture as bold as the ‘Envois’ will be required to find a suitable vehicle for this project. A suitable elegy for Kittler, one that was up to the task of thinking media after Kittler, might not require us to walk with his ghost in the early morning but to pick him up from the station in a fast car and to be the first to spill his secrets before we have reached our destina- tion. He has so much to tell us and we cannot help but pass it on, it will burn our hands and tongues otherwise. ON THE TYPEWRITER AND ITS RELATION TO LITERATURE Someone must have been spreading lies about K . . . for having saluted Kittler and recognized the importance of his thought not only for a rigorous reflection on media but for all that this means for the univer- sity and the disciplines of the humanities, I will now identify my wor- ries about his writing on writing.

network of roads. Kittler refers to the Roman Empire as the network of roads itself since it is imbricated in the culture, experience and practice of the power of the empire to the point of not being distinguishable – the network is a manifestation of the Empire itself, that is, the keystone of reading that historical moment. Kittler’s last effort is precisely to look at western history through a totalizing evolution of music and mathematics, using as a reference the conceptions of western sensibility – a monumental conception of the great systems of recording as the testimonies of western poetry and thought – starting with the Greek (Aphrodite und Eros), passing by the Roman Empire (Sexus und Virginitas), progressing toward medieval times with Minne, Liebe and Sex, and ending its tour in the present times, Turingzeit (Kittler, 2006, 2009). His latter works put in place a new set of concepts that promise a new understanding of culture

tions in Foucault’s book of the source of these discourses, of the channels or the receivers of discourse.”6 Kittler thus criticizes Foucault’s archaeologies of knowledge for failing to take into account how media technologies influence the formation of systems of knowledge.7 Instead of focusing exclusively on discourses, Kittler is more interested in their material substrates, which he famously describes as “inscription systems” (Aufschreibesysteme).8 As Well- bery explains, “these technologies are not mere instruments with which ‘man’ produces his meanings. . . . Rather, they set the framework within which some- thing like ‘meaning,’ indeed, something like ‘man,’ become possible at all.”9 Unlike Foucault, Kittler also focuses on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and he is particularly interested in the contemporary shift toward digital media. What is essentially new about…

of German media theory: “The focus on the materiality and technicality of meaning constitution prompted German media theorists to turn Foucault’s concept of the ‘historical a priori’ into a ‘technical a priori’ by referring the Foucauldian ‘archive’ to media technologies.”15 Kittler’s work thus repre- sented a challenge to the humanist tradition as well as the practice of herme- neutic analysis: “The insistence on these media reference systems, designed as an attack on the reason- or mind-based humanist reference systems, was guided by a deeply anti-humanist rejection of the tradition of the Enlighten- ment and the established discursive rules of hermeneutic interpretation.”16 However, Kittler’s focus on this technical a priori soon led to accusations that his own work was a symptom (if not the cause) of anti-humanist tendencies within the humanities. In one of the earliest artic…

xviii Foreword Ph.D. on museology in 1989. His work started to take a medial turn in the 1990s (largely due to the influence of Kittler’s work), as he began to develop his own Foucauldian reading of media archives, which culminated in such works as M.edium F.oucault (2000), Das Rumoren der Archive (Stirrings in the Archives, 2002), and Im Namen der Geschichte. Sammeln—Speichern— Er/zählen (In the Name of History: Collecting—Storing—Re/counting, 2003). In these books, Ernst extends Kittler’s focus on archival technologies by arguing that media are the true archivists of the past: “It is worth remember- ing that the archive as the condition for our knowledge of history becomes dependent on the media of its transmission.”33 However, his approach differs somewhat in its explicit critique of historiography. Like Kittler, for example, Ernst embraces Foucault’s model of epistemic rupt…

well with the luminiferous ether and the anima mundi, the subtle fluids and strange angels that intermingled with the departed souls of pho- nography and the trick shots of cinema. But for the most part, in Gramo- phone, Kittler displaces such business to premodernist media: The invention of the Morse alphabet in 1837 was promptly followed by the tap- ping specters of spiritistic seances sending their messages from the realm of the dead. Promptly as well, photographic plates—even and especially those taken with the camera shutter closed—furnished reproductions of ghosts or specters. (12) While the telegraph and daguerreotype remain outside Gramophone, Film, Typewriter's primary historical field, Kittler;s insistence on the material basis and thus empirical examinability of all media that medi- ate the cultural imaginary is a crucial theoretical move. Moreover, "The realm of the dead is a…

was brought into focus after Kittler. For Kittler, an archaeology of the present was not achievable through the, at the time, traditional Western focus on semiotics and the theory of signs. What was needed instead was a focus on all types of discourse as essentially networks of data processing, which would replace the emphasis on language with an emphasis on the material and the

zation. Both sorts of inscription—inscription on humans and tablets—were key parts of the scribal task. There is no separate word in Sumerian for “teacher.”3 In the case of Mesopotamia, we have an unusually rich variety of data on which to draw in researching this scribal matrix. First and foremost, tens of thousands of student exercises have been preserved, mostly from the Old Bab- ylonian period. These range from very rough, oblong copies of lexical lists and small literary excerpts to larger copies of parts or all of major Mesopotamian compositions.4 Their clay form allowed them to be preserved, even though many such tablets were discarded by their original users. From the same period we have various satirical educational dialogues, both disputes between plants or animals and recreations of school debates. Though the often satirical form of these compositions and their educational fun…

would be difficult for us to say, at first glance, what the figure of th~ content of the sememe "constitution" would be (for example, one can see that in the code studied by Hutt the content God is visualized by means of the figure of a triangle, before being transposed into gesture)- it nonetheless points to the existence of a certain stylistic distance between the content of a sign and its figure at the level of expression. This immanent stylistics appears to the naked eye when, abandoning accom- panying gestures, we begin to concentrate on artificial signs. Analyzing the for- mation of the "composite words" of an artificial code, Hutt cites the example of bee, the content of which is manifested by two figures of expression: the figure wing and the figure sweet. The first figure at the moment it takes on form passes from the content wing to the content that which flies, wherea…

the function is a dicey business at best. Considerations which are of aid in this task include the associational context in which the artefact is found at the site, analysis of use wear patterns on the artefact itself, and clues provided by the known functions of similar artefacts in contemporary cultures. It is, of course, understood that any of these sources of evidence may be misleading. The object may have been deposited in the association context by accident rather than because of some inherent connection with the other objects found there. Similarly, accidental abrasion or damage may be mistaken for use wear, or apparent correspondence with the function of current use objects may be merely apparent. But the recognition of the distinction between proper func- tion and system function adds a new and uncomfortable wrinkle to these difficulties. Clearly it is the proper function of unearthed artefacts which is the

The very material needed for such an image (iron) indicates that this image would be marked by firmness and durability. It also points to such an image’s incompatibility with the locus of the poem, Patmos, since the island was introduced as the “poorer house” (v. 62), thus lacking the “riches” required.62 Instead of such a rich remembrance of Christ, then, the closing lines of “Patmos” turn away from iron-clad images

In general, an inscription “gives voice” to the stone or the object it is written on or claims to be written on, by conveying a message and recording words. Since the beginning, the verse inscription as a concrete and visible form of communication has lived alongside its less pre- tentious, though more numerous, prose cousins: one of its peculiarities, which it surely shares with the prose inscriptions, is that of having been conceived as a written text, not as the transcription of a pre-existent oral message.2 Therefore, since the writing support on which the inscription is carved forms an indivisible whole with it, epigram is the closest ancient literary genre to the material object, and funerary and votive inscriptions in particular are inextricably tied to the material supports bearing them.3 In the sepulchral realm, an inscription “gives voice” to the tombstone or to the tom…

to professionals trained for this purpose or training themselves. If the Olympic lists available in the fourth century B.c. did really go back to the first quarter of the eighth, their source was oral transmission, not alphabetic notation. To presume that any kind of Greek literacy, however re- stricted, existed before the date of the first inscriptions is to rely on the assumption that the alphabet was applied to the surface of parchment, papyrus, or possibly wood and (if this assumption is used to explain early Greek chronology) that this usage occurred at least fifty years and probably longer before the letters were applied to hard physical objects. This, at first, may seem reasonable, given the possible loss due to perishabil- ity of the materials as against marble or fired clay. The literate context of our own culture again supplies an analogy which, though misleading, is powerful. …

assimilated, like the lever and the toothed gear, to a prilnary machine (in its canonical definition, "any instrument designed to transmit the action of a force onto a point that does not already lie in its direction, or to change the direction of this force" ).1 Hittite cuneiform writing had produced those novel cultural objects: tables, lists, inventories, dating systems, etc. The vocalic alphabet, transmitted from Syrio-Phoenician to the Greek city-state, made possible not only the first government of men by men (and not by the gods or their prophets) but also an amazing space for displays of learnedness, which extended the rights of citizenship to the arts of argument, to a critical relation to tradition, and to the subjec­ tion of rumors and myths to new norms of veracity.

ways—vivifying its sculpted legends along a projected emotional and phonological trajectory matched to a 360-degree inspection of the material object itself—amounts almost to turning the artifact in the poet’s own refashioning hand, all that euphony and metaphor at its fingertips. With Brument’s Vase, in contrast, enough guttural urs may turn into an urn through merely the least grunt of sub-verse intonation. The rhetorically shaped artifact and its rounded internal double in the Ode has become, two centuries later, simply (if astonishingly) the signal-generated receptor and its microfashioned receptacle. So that “please do not touch” has been outplayed by the automatically push­ button manifestation of a once hand-tooled craft. For whereas Keats could only call out to the permanence and visual authority of an antique art in the supposed half measure of “word pictures,” here, under the new digitized mediation of voice transcription, any museum goer, however

general scheme which he had formed in his brain’ (Doyle 2001, p. 617). Similarly, in the introduction to Palestinian Syriac Texts From Palimpsest Frag- ments in the Taylor-Schechter Collection (1900), Agnes Smith Lewis describes how the underscript of Fragments I and II of this collection might have remained undetected if it were not for the presence of a more skilled eye than her own: The underscript of these [Fragments I. and II.] was mistaken by me for a faint brown streak of dirt; and it was thus left to Dr Schechter, who knew the appearance of the Hebrew script in the fragments of his own collection, to recognize that this streak was really an ancient text. (p. ix) In both detective and palimpsest reading, once these clues have been detected, the reconstruction of the underlying text depends upon a certain amount of ‘conjecture’ or ‘invention’. This is evident in Holmes’ method of reasoning, which is not, as is commonly supposed, deductive.

preface xv the structure of textual inscription in general would infer and require a certain condition of the gift, ‘in the writing itself’: Let us first of all not forget something trivially and massively obvious. It constitutes the elemental medium for what one is given to think here, namely, that this text – apparently finite, this bit of corpus title ‘Counter- feit Money’ – is for us a given. It is there before us who read it and who therefore begin by receiving it. If it has the structure of a given, it is not only because we are first of all in a receptive position with regard to it but because it has been given to us. From the moment he published it and even if he had not published it, from the moment he wrote it and con- stituted it by dedicating it to his ‘dear friend’ . . . from the moment he let it constitute itself in a system of traces, he destined it, gave it, not …

The inscription may have been painted in alternating lines of red and black. If so, an ancient Greek reader will notice an economi- cal fact. The single verse contains two epitaphs. The red letters (tomb spinther set) make one sentence and the black letters (this upon spinther dead) make another. Now let us take the measure of letters a little deeper. Look at the syntax. On the epitaph the word SpŒinjhr is a noun in the nominative case that stands as subject of the sentence directly on top of SpŒinjhrÃ, a noun in the dative case that is indirect object of the sentence. Spinther’s action as agent of the verb ŠepŒejhke (“set”) is to confer a “tomb” (sœhma) upon his own dead self. The 25 Although the Palatine Anthology regards the poem as incomplete and leaves a space for a missing pentameter, Page believes it is an early single-hexameter epigram of the type illustrated by Friedl¨ander and …

genrée : les quelques archéolo- gues grecques en exercice au début du xxe siècle n’eurent jamais accès aux principaux sites de fouilles. Au contraire, on leur assigna l’entretien des artefacts fonctionnels, des tex- tiles, des costumes. Toutefois, même si l’on préféra la restau- ration des colonnes de marbre aux motifs ottomans de la vie quotidienne, ces pratiques moins visibles pourraient être à l’origine d’une nouvelle forme d’archéologie, édifiant ainsi une contre-interprétation du canon historiographique natio- naliste. Ce ilm – constituant lui-même une archive – nous pousse à voir le patrimoine (l’étymologie du terme étant déjà problématique) sous un jour nouveau – cultivant un regard fragmenté, elliptique, tourné vers l’image manquante CORRESPONDANCE.

techniques’ (p. 348). Scientists are using similarly advanced techniques at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore on the Archimedes Palimpsest. A new method of resurrection known as ‘multispectral imaging’ is being employed. Fascinatingly, its name carries the ghostly imagery that has surrounded palimpsests since the mid-nineteenth century into the language of contemporary palimpsest technologies. In this technique, images of the palimpsest in infrared, ordinary and ultraviolet light are taken with a scientiﬁc camera. The Archimedes ink and the prayer-book ink have their own spectral signatures and thus respond differently to different light wavelengths. Therefore, when the digital images are loaded onto a computer, software used to analyse satellite photographs of Earth can be programmed to recognize only the Archimedes signature, suppress the overlying script, and make the Archimedes text stand out. One cannot but wonder what De Quincey would have made of such twenty-ﬁrst-century

of black and white may be traced, he implies, to the chasms or the figures ‘so mysteriously written in their windings.’ But whether the inscriptions portend racial massacre or refer more broadly to the yearning for escape from the shadow of death (the arm of the human form is ‘outstretched toward the south,’ toward ‘brilliancy and whiteness’), this commentary on writing within the abyss - or writing as abyss - calls attention to engravings which bear witness to the dilemma of mortality. In some primal scene, perhaps coeval with the formation of the chasms themselves, an unknown writer conscious of the ephemerality of speech and his own perishability as a speaking subject carved upon the wall those ‘alphabetical characters’ by which he might continue to speak after is own decease. Whatever their topical content, the ancient inscriptions on Tsalal thus refer to the genesis of …

Kittler narrates the development of analog media as events leading to an as yet unreached digital climax. The speculative climax of his historical fabula appears at the beginning of his discourse, as an anticipation of an outcome in the making. The tale then reverts to its nineteenth-century preconditions and focuses on readings of the events that push this plot along. In his telling, there are constant shifts of topic, a kaleidoscopic round of detail framed by the gradual chronological progression of the histori…

manner of inscription, indeed productive of a sort of memorization freed from the supposedly immediate condi- tions of time and space. The question to follow here would be as follows: what is a body (body proper, social body) in tele-graphic culture? It calls up a spontaneous production of the past in habit, a tradition or transmission of ways of thinking, willing and feeling, a sort of breaching, then, which complicates, counters, neutralizes and extenuates earlier community breachings, and in any case translates them so as to move them on too, make them transmissible. If the earlier breachings remain there at all, resist a bit, they become subcultures. The question of a hegemonic teleculture on a world scale is already posed. LOGOS AND TECHNE, OR TELEGRAPHY (b) The breachings corresponding to this culture have still to a large extent to be carried out for most human beings. This is why this culture raises questions. Stiegler is right to

into a single book, Kitton’s project not only marks an early and prominent use of the term, but it also dramatises fantasies of recovery and completeness that are often active in the collection of Dickensiana more generally. The second object, a letter opener made from the paw of Dickens’s cat, offers an example of the special status that personal effects have for collectors of Dickensiana (as they do for all collectors of author memorabilia), since they serve as artefacts and evidence of his textual production as a lived process. The letter opener’s singularity and, more significantly, its use of taxidermy uncannily literalise the collector’s desire to establish a tangible

The issue of textual assembly and interpretation hinges on the analysis of a cryptic message that has sixty characters in it and which appears on a stone that ‘has a secret unspeak­ able name on it: Ixaxar’ (p. 58). Decoding the mystery will lead Gregg to the occulted Celtic figures who inhabit the area (again, in South Wales) where he lives. Gregg employs a local boy, Jervase Cradock, to help with menial tasks. Jervase is prone to fits in which he speaks ‘an infamous jar­ gon, with words, or what seemed words, that might have belonged to a tongue dead since untold ages’ (p. 64), which for Miss Lally ‘“is the very speech of hell”’ (p. 64), whereas for Gregg it is a language that ‘“belongs to … the fairies”’ (p. 66) that he is looking for. Landmarks also possess a symbolic import when Gregg notes of the designs on a bridge that ‘“I confess it …

90 Michel Serres and French Philosophy of Science as I will argue, what initially looks like a paradox or a weakness – namely that it is unclear whether Latour speaks about things or about words – is in fact a strength of this alternative perspective, as developed by Dagognet and Serres. François Dagognet and inscriptions In the early work of Latour the concepts of ‘inscription’ and ‘inscription device’ play a central role. The idea of an inscription device is introduced in Laboratory Life (1979) and refers to the apparatuses that ‘transform pieces of matter into written documents. More exactly, an inscription device is any item of apparatus or particular configuration of such items which can transform a material substance into a figure or diagram which is directly usable by one of the members of the office space’ (Latour and Woolgar 1979, 51). They derive this term from the con…

Papyrus documents, whose material base is vegetal, com­ pensate for this by making possible the sharpened reed stylus, thereby favoring simplified and minimal systems of symbols and characters, notably non-capitalization. Without our rehearsing the transitions from stone to clay to papyrus to parchment to paper to screen, each reader can imagine for himself how a Latin maxim carved on the stone monument in a public place for collective read­ ing in Rome will not call forth the same interpretation as the identical sentence in the course of a letter of Cicero's.

The first portion is missing and there are lots of gaps, hence there have been a number of different interpretation and translations. Here I follow the translation adopted by Miriam Lichtheim, and present quotations taken from her panoramic study of ancient Egyptian literature.48 The man explains that he is tired of living. His reputation has been trashed: Lo, my name reeks – more than carrion smell on summer days of burning sky. Lo, my name reeks – more than a catch of fish on fishing days of burning sky. Lo, my name reeks, more than that of a wife about whom lies are told to the husband. His belongingness is severely thwarted. He is all alone, deserted by past friends in an evil, uncaring world: To whom shall I speak today? Brothers are mean. The friends of today do not love. To whom shall I speak today? I am burdened with grief

previous archaeological texts have been effective in some way, to a greater or lesser degree, and have shaped the assemblage within which this synthesis must operate. The question is what effect they have had, how secure is the resulting region of the assemblage, and what happens if we untie the supporting connec- tions and take some of the strands elsewhere? Part of that process remains the consideration of whether new concepts articulate well with what remains of the entanglement as we remove some elements—but these new concepts should not reify ‘social entities’ like alternative models of social organization. We cannot simply ‘return to things’ without exploring the history of the things as they are now in their fullest sense, having been successively translated through various interactions and differing media. Thus I will critically examine the translations to Chalcolithic and Early …

complexity of information. 2. Languages and genres Innis examines a second level in the patterning of media in the languages, scripts, and genres of content. For example, he observed that hieroglyphics carved into stone monuments and pyramids of Old Kingdom Egypt tended to be square, upright, decorative, and pictographic. This style emerged partly from working with chisel and stone, but was also connected with the reli- gious and political environment in which this medium was being used, the third level of Innis’s analysis. The rigid styles and the use of durable media were closely associated with a centralised society that venerated religious authority in which knowledge was monopolised (Innis, 1972b). After 2000BC, hieroglyphics came to be written by brush onto papyrus

with ‘perhaps semi-barbaric people’.

The licence to journey, unearth and preserve is backed, both literally and metaphorically, by political power: For the stones are made to speak by those with the power to do so; that is, those who can erect temples, mausoleums, and triumphal arches, and those who can recover and reconstruct them. In the nineteenth century at least, only empires excavated empires.

A cairn is a “sepulchral monument over the grave of some person of distinction” (O.E.D 315). The journal lies beside a “breviary,” but there is “no trace of the catechism or Knight’s Mod- ern Seamanship,” leading Manfred Katz (previously in charge of the alligator operation) to conclude that “‘maybe they are studying the best way to leave a sinking ship’” (125)—an image with connects Father Fairing’s endeavor to the aquatic necrotype of descent, and burial at sea.

not tried to impose a consistent definition of idolatry on our contributors. In this introduction, however, we focus on the idol as a material thing and on the concerns that surround human interaction with it.14 The grammar of the idol that we propose, therefore, proceeds as follows. Using primarily the mīs pî ritual and related Mesopotamian practices, we will consider the following five determinants of the idol: the question of making, the concept of likeness, the representational or presentational status of objects, understandings of human power, and the immanent or transcendent character of the divine. Today, we know the Mesopotamian mīs pî or “mouth-washing” ritual from a series of cuneiform tablets dating to the first millennium b.c.e., though the ceremony itself probably first appeared in older epochs. The most extensive manuscripts come from Nineveh and Babylon. These texts allow for a recon-

there prior to the social inscription. In this model, cultural and social norms are viewed as “written on the body”; the body is seen as inscribed, engraved, marked. Elizabeth Grosz uses the example of tattooing and scarification to discuss how in- scription operates. Butler likens inscription to writing and uses the metaphor of “the body as the blank page.” While Foucault’s model of cultural inscription can account for such cases of physical inscription, it also refers to the physical and so- cial conditions that affect the body, such as environment, climate, diet, regimes. Foucault’s main discussion of the inscription model is in “Nietzsche, Genealogy, History,” although his most extended discussions of the body can be found in his genealogical works, The History of Sexuality Volume One and Discipline and Punish, Foucault and the Body 105

back the recorded sounds. Kittler similarly points to the analytical function of the phonograph and gramophone, which retrieve the original function of Scott’s invention, where he argues that the analysis of speech – an analysis of the material rather than the symbolic – that was afforded by the invention of recorded voice machines was instrumental to the vast changes to discourse seen around the end of the nineteenth century. These machines were able to be used for analytical purposes by slowing down the playback speed to reproduce for human ears sounds previously unable to be notated. The gramophone and phonograph, when used as a talking machine, were able to allow slow-motion studies of single sounds that were previously unavailable. This made the devices ideal in laboratories for measuring hearing. In schools, these devices were instrumental in allowing the analysis of ‘th…

within which such vessels moved. This context, with its charts and tables, its instruments and its trained navigators may be seen as an important part of the Portuguese imperial network. I suggest that the Portuguese navigational innovation depended upon three parallel but interrelated techniques: one, after Foucault (1979), for the creation of docile bodies (here navigators); a second, after recent work by Latour (1985), for the creation of powerful yet passive and transportable documents (here astronomical tables); and a third for the generation of docile devices (for instance astrolabes). If the West achieved hegemony then, so runs the argument, this may be explained by referring to revolutions in these three related methods for creating loyal, mobile, yet otherwise passive agents. The last essay in the monograph is by Bruno Latour who is also concerned with methods for …

147 This short text has delighted, confused, and provoked scholars since its discovery in the Eastern Arabah archaeological digs, near the ancient city of Petra, in 1844. The dispute continues regarding precisely how to categorize such a work: an irony not lost on those representing all sides of the argument, given that the text itself is explicitly dedicated to the act of categorization. The original Latin script dates from the seventh century ad, was inscribed on the finest vellum (suggesting official patronage), remarkably well preserved in a garnet-encrusted bronze cylinder, seemingly designed for just this purpose. Liberal use of terms and phrases in Arabic suggest the work was written—probably collectively—between neo-Aristotelian theologians and Persians of the cosmopolitan Sufi persuasion. (Such collaborations were reasonably common, up until the Crusades.) Certain i…

The accumulation of data on these pages calls for an examination of symmetrical patterns: the larynxes parallel one another even though they are different sizes, and the information at the bot- tom (the Kodak brand and the number of each picture) is also set up as a mirror. We cannot easily make sense of the facing page. On page 255, the red traces that appear vertically on the right-hand side of the page remind us of blood, but could also be waves of frequency. In addition, the circles on which are printed RNA Pol II, TAFs, etc. look like medical pills or drawings of cells in a science book.

Il est devenu membre de l’agence Magnum en 1994. Les systèmes de pouvoir et leur impact visuel sur la société constituent son thème de prédilection. Il a consacré des séries au colonialisme, au communisme ou à la religion. Mario Heller. Aujourd’hui installé à Berlin, ce jeune pâtissier suisse a décidé d’embrasser la pho- tographie en 2015. En marge de son travail de rédacteur photo au sein de journaux successifs, il ne cesse d’arpenter le monde. De ces pérégrinations hors des sentiers battus au Kazakhstan, Tadjiki- stan, en Arctique ou en Californie, il a ramené des reportages racontant aussi bien les lieux que les personnes, dont plusieurs ont été couronnés de prix.

audiophilic detour. Widely associated with his writings on photography, Benjamin is less well known for his contributions to the early history of radio. Between 1927 to 1933, Benjamin made more than eighty broadcasts over the new medium, working at stations in Berlin and Frankfurt. Some of these performances were given in the form of Ho¨rmodelle (listening models, or radio models); some were commissioned speciﬁcally for Berlin radio’s Jugendstunde or the Stunde der Jugend on Su¨dwestdeutschen Rund- funks in Frankfurt.4 In either instance, perhaps all the more so for the latter given the directed speciﬁcity of its target audience, the issue of programming—of culture as (pre)programmed—asserts some force and sway. In the extant manuscripts of his radio addresses, including those performed for children, Benjamin can hardly be said to presume a deﬁni- tion of his addressee (‘‘children’’) or …

graphic elements. In contrast to the torches on MacPherson’s sarcophagus, which were directed towards the ground indicating memento mori, the Beckers stela depicts a torch which points upwards, and accented by the wavy pattern of the torch’s fire; this is accompanied by the inscription ‘VOORLICHTING’ (meaning information, education, or counseling in Dutch), thus underscor­ ing the interpretation of the torch, not as a Christian symbol, but as a symbol of Enlightenment and social activism. The headstone’s main inscription con­ nects this iconographic element to biographical information: Beckers was a civil servant concerned with the protection of workers’ rights. Under the main inscription we find the wreath, with another inscription revealing that the stela was erected by the deceased’s friends. The latter is a regular ­feature of the socialist graves in Tongerseweg Cemetery, in…

CHAPTER ONE AFTER THE MEDIA: THE TEXTILITY OF CULTURAL TECHNIQUES BERNHARD SIEGERT 1. Media After Kittler Since Friedrich Kittler left this world in October 2011, numerous conferences and obituaries have been dedicated to the discussion of his legacy. The question of the past and the future of the so-called media is in this context of particular interest – especially with regard to the discipline of media studies, which is still developing, or already vanishing again. After Kittler, the meaning of media history as well as the necessity of media theory is on trial. The double meaning of after (in the Latin sense of either secundum or post) provides a useful framework for this revision. On the one hand, the question is what role after Kittler (in the sense of secundum or according to Kittler) media history and theory played in the humanities. Historical media studies, which emerged in the eighties of the
