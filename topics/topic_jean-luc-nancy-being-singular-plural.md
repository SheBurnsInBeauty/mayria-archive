tion by (psychoanalytic) discourse (see James 2006: 58-62). Nancy's philosophical arguments relating to this bodily and ungrounded site of exteriority, excess or exposure open the way for all his later formulations around questions of community, embodiment, shared existence and his ontology of the singular plural (discussed in chapter 2 ).

“The singular plural/singular is the law and the problem of ‘art’, as it is of ‘sense’ or of the sense of the senses, of the sensed sense of the sensuous difference.”23 23 Pl3. 24 As described in Jeff Hawkins, On Intelligence (New York: Times Books, 2004). 25 Jean-Luc Nancy, The Muses (Stanford: Stanford University Press. 1996), p36. As Nancy explains, no single art can entirely epitomise art in general, just as no single sense defines the paradigm of sensing. This can be reduced to a simple derivation from mathematics, which Nancy also shows. In set theory a single member does not make a set - there must always be more than one member to create ■.ice set. This tension between the example and the general group it’s supposed to exemplify is a crucial element of the notion of identity we will be discussing in a later chapter. It’s also a core part of recent neurological theory24, where it is now believed that the inputs from the various senses are homogenised

occur especially in private writings (2 per cent of all the instances of the third-person singular in the HC; Kytö 1993: 118). See example (6). (6) My humble service to ye Lady Thanet and my Lady Cicelea. Yr sister disir ye same to you and to the La Cicelea. (HC, Elizabeth Hatton, 1666: 50) These occasional omissions of the third-person singular present-tense sufﬁx fall in with a more general tendency towards levelling person and number marking in English verb morphology. Here the singular follows the model set by the plural. The southern plural sufﬁx -(e)th had largely been lost by the beginning of the Early Modern period, as had the plural -(e)s in the North and -(e)n in the Midlands, which both used to vary with zero depending on the construction type. In the General dialect, zero plurals predominate in the present tense in the sixteenth century, although occasional plural marking sti…

BEING-WITH AFTER 1989: STOLEN COMMUNITIES JEAN-LUC NANCY:3 Peut-etre n'y a-t-il pas vraiment une opposition entre «traditionnel» et «non-traditionnel» : la tradition c'est aussi celle de l'echange, du frottement des cervelles, des esprits, des langages. Il s'agit moins de par­ ler du «dialogue» dans sa figure heuristique et dialectique que plus simplement, plus humblement, des contacts, frot­ tements, petits et grands chocs dans le magma desquels tou­ jours «âa pense» : non des sujets pensent, mais l'epoque, le monde pensent . . .

The second relates to the specific image of thought that emerges from his practice of philosophy at the limit. Both these points will be explored at greater length in chapter 2 under the rubric of Nancy’s naturalism and the alignment of his discourse with scientific thought and knowledge. However, first it needs to be noted that Nancy’s experience of thought, insofar as it is one in which freedom, existence, and thought itself are inti- mately bound together, gives rise to an affirmation of an existence not simply as both singular and plural but also, in this singular plurality, as necessarily relational. Insofar as freed existence surges as existence each time singularly in the absence of any ground or foundation, it does so only in…

as it presupposes that ‘feminism’ when used in the singular is untroubled by differ- ence. As editors, we have used the term feminism in the singular, while paying attention to those differences that cannot simply be reduced to differences between feminists. We are also quite resistant to the assumption that to add an s to a term, particularly one which is so difficult to pin down (and yet so powerful in its effects), is necessarily to make a substantive commitment to analyse differences. Adding the s whenever one uses the term ‘feminism’ can easily become a rather tired and liberal gesture, which declares plurality at the level of naming, but which does not then argue the case for differences that cannot be reconciled into this pluralism. 2 See the journal differences (1997), 9: 3. 3 The conference was ‘Transformations: Thinking Through Feminism’, held at the Institute for Women’s Studies, Lancaster University, UK, 17–19 July 1997. 4

interface, one which can only exist in relation to, and not prior to, any possi- ble meeting. The originary fractured overlap of so-called subjects—ﬂagged by Heidegger’s concept of Mitsein (with-being) and developed by Jean-Luc Nancy in his discussion of ‘‘being singular plural’’ (that is, being simultane- ously both singular and plural)—subverts the common mode of egocentric, atomistic thinking on the matter of social relations. As Paul Morris puts it: Beginning from the assumption of the existence and reality of the individual, who then, and only then, forges links between herself and other separate and discrete individuals, it becomes all but impossible to conceive of any sort of com- munity at all. One plus one plus one plus one plus one just never seem to add up to more than a number! This separating out of individuals . . . does not let us put Humpty Dumpty together again. (1996, 226) In other words, we have yet to respond adequately to the wealth of writings

plied nothing. In the continued expansion of its internal and external plurality, each is its Not and cannot but show itself, and withdraw, in this Not-­Being. Each points into its withdrawal; each speaks its falling ­silent. Therefore, the sovereignty of each and thus the sovereignty of Being-­with can occur only as extension, and therefore this occurrence can never be concentrated in a single fixed point at one with itself.

A BSENC E : P O U R JEAN-LUC NANCY presence emerge. La relation entre les deux apporte une ex­ tension de la memoire de !'absence et le raccourcissement de la memoire dans la presence. Peut-etre que c'est ici que la musique presente l'ecart entre l'ecrit et la performance du tel OU tel donne a chaque instant, de !'improvise. Dans !'improvisation, il se passe justement c;a, la memoire nous rappelle l'avenir et nous faire quitter le passe par la presence de l' absence. Concernant la visite a Jean-Luc Nancy a Strasbourg, je suis alle comme accompagnant et pas comme membre du groupe de recherche. Il etait important OU plutot correct de me tenir a distance des discussions academiques qui, certes, m'ont apporte beaucoup de joie. La memoire semblait tout le temps comme le centre de tout ce que j'ai entendu. Il s'agissait autant de la memoire de l'avenir comme de la memoire du passe. J'erais done a la fois absent et present.

acher, therefore, is also already rewriting this relation, and he would go further by responding to Nancy’s “Being-­with” with an Aristotelian “Be- ing-so,” where the “so” gestures ­toward “an always indeterminate other” that is beyond name, concept, and definition, ­going beyond as well the universal and the par­tic­u­lar. But to come back to the thought of Nancy among the phi­los­o­phers, Hamacher’s essay fittingly attests to the “commu- nality” of phi­los­o­phers Nancy’s thinking of “being singular plural” follows ­after and influences: Heraclitus, Plato, Aristotle, Hegel, Nietz­sche, Hei- degger, Benjamin, Bataille, Blanchot, Agamben . . .

In the matter of number, I can say that the decorative quality of a passage is not enhanced only by words which are singular in form, but which on close examination are found to have a plural meaning, as in Straightway a countless host ranged along the beaches send out a cry, 'Tunny!' 1 But it is more noteworthy that at times the use of the plural in place of the singular has a more resounding effect, and impresses us by the very idea of multitude implied in the plural number. This is exemplified by Sophocles in some lines spoken by Oedipus: O marriages, marriages, it is you that begot me and gave me birth, and then brought to light again the same seed, and showed fathers, brothers, and sons as being all kindred blood, and brides, wives, and mother…

Lacan claims that “in any relation of man with a woman […] it is from the per- spective of the One-missing that she must be taken up” (SXX, 129; emphasis added). As Fink observes, the French expression l’Une en moins can be rendered as both “the One-missing” and “the One-less.” I would specify only that the capital “One” stresses the absence of the feminine universal, while the lower-case “one” seems more appro- priate when focusing on woman’s singularity. In the latter case, “the one- less ” better emphasizes the counting of the “one-by-one” than “the one- missing .” These two dimensions (that of “the One-missing” and that of “the one-less”) are, however, entwined, and cannot be conceived correctly in isolation. 120 .

That ‘‘my God’’ performs a triple naming of addresser, addressee, and relation of address indicates that it names supplementarily, according to the singularity of this relational event of calling. These supplementary names position themselves next to what Nancy calls ‘‘the de´faut of a sin- gular name,’’ which he suggests applies to all singular or proper names. A 60 Cryptic Crossing

and ‘one another’. The rule of grammar that governs such construc- tions is that the pronouns must have an antecedent in the plural. The problem is to ﬁnd the antecedent. In typical cases, it is present in the same clause as the reciprocal pronoun, preferentially in the position of subject, as in: (5) The men recognized each other. But there are complications, as the antecedent is not always in the same clause, and we must account for the fact that (6) and (7) are grammatical, but (8) and (9) are not (I am using Chomsky’s examples): (6) The candidates wanted each other to win.

I have used Whitehead’s original technical terminology wher- ever possible: ‘togetherness’ for être-ensemble, ‘environment’ for milieu, ‘route’ for trajectoire, ‘causal efficacy’, when appropriate, for causalité efficiente; ‘presentational immediacy’ for présenta- tion immédiate, ‘the many’, when appropriate, for diversité or pluralité, ‘nexūs’ as the plural of ‘nexus’. Any failures to com- municate the intended meaning of the original French are my own responsibility.

“ iterability” I revisit later in this introduction) and more recent theo- rists such as Derek Attridge, Timothy Clark, and Samuel Weber.5 I owe a debt to all of these theorists, but I also aim to provide an ac- count of the subject that is crucially new. For Derrida, what is most singular—unique and irreducible—is what is paradoxically iterable and repeatable. For Deleuze, what is most singular is “opposed to the ordinary.” Singularity is an infl ection point and zone of potenti- ality, one that is constitutively multiple rather than single.6 We fi nd a similar refusal of the “single” in singular in Nancy’s well-known phrase, “being singular plural.” “Being singular plural” articulates the constitutive plurality of being and the strangeness and beside- ness that marks living in a world stripped of essentialized origins. The question of community for Nancy is not about the grouping of “identities” around particular kinds of sameness but around the

That brings me to a play on words, this time a true one: like stripping away one [comme un ôté].7 Community: that would be as if the “one” found itself taken away [enlevé], suppressed; as if the “two” or the “plural” substitutes for it (and not the great “One” of an All of superior magnitude, since we would then return to the beginning). The “one” is always stripped away, subtracted from the “more than one” [plus d’un]. But it is precisely then that it is, or that it makes, “one.” irving: So, I also hear “being singular plural” in your articulations of the “more than one” and the “one” that is “in itself plural, divided, and composed.” But I imagine that all this is possible only, again, through sex. Which is to say that one such community where the “one” is stripped away seems always to be in the shadow of every so­ ciety, often prohibited from coming to presence in the socia…

the fact of "inoperative community" presents itself in a specifie non-chronological present (which we have also shown to be at stake in Nancy's conceptualization of tinle). Lalllbert refers to Bataille to articulate this present. FoIlowing Bataille, he argues that this present is "a time that is founded on nothing other than its own present, which is to say, a present without before or after, without order, which causes us to become dizzy and disoriented, ecstatic in our horizons, beside ourselves in the very present." For hinl, it is this present, this "dizziness, vertigo, dis orientation [that] also defInes our passion before every other singular being with WhOlTI we share the present in the fornl of an essential absence of relation." The question then is how writing can inscribe that present and/ or that absence of relation. According to Larnbert, this is where Nancy's conceptualization of writing, with its double-

tical entities. The value of a French plural does not coincide with that of a Sanskrit plural even though their signification is usually identical; Sanskrit has three num- bers instead of two (my eyes, my ears, my arms, my Ieos, etc. are dual); 1 it would be wrong to attribute the same value to the plural in Sanskrit and in French; its value clearly depends on what is outside and around it. If words stood for pre-existing concepts, they would all have exact equivalents in meaning from one language to the next; but this is not true. French uses louer (une maison) 'let (a house)' indifferently to mean both "pay for" and "receive payment for," whereas German uses two words, mieten and vermieten; there is obviously no exact correspondence of values. The German verbs schi:itzen and urteilen share a number of significations, but that correspondence does not hold at several points. I…

poet, essayist, economist, philosopher, [or] mystic?” – Bataille is typi- cally left out of “the literary manuals” of work-centered critics (157). Barthes asserts, further, that the text is “plural. Which is not simply to say that it has several meanings, but that it accomplishes the very plural of meaning: an irreducible (and not merely an acceptable) plu- ral” (159). This plurality always involves an interaction of reader with author and of texts with other texts, a condition of “intertextuality” whose dynamics also challenge assumptions about what is intrinsic or extrinsic to the literary “object,” and which Kristeva first adumbrated in a 1966 presentation on the Russian theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, while she was a student in Barthes’s seminar.24 Barthes’s emphasis on the text’s “plurality” follows from the crucial proposal, also central to Kristeva’s approach to language and meaning, th…

the linguistic phenomenon must have substance. Note The use of the comparative form for two and the superlative for more than two in English (e.g. may the better boxer win: the best boxer in the worlJ) is probably a remnant of the old distinction between the dual and the plural number. [Tr.)

moreover, the second person singular was chosen in the imperative, for the intended close rapport with the reader referred to above (the option of the plural is equally valid but establishes a distance). Similar decisions were taken in other cases, such as the poems "The Blue Ghazals" and "Pierrot Le Fou" from The Will to Change (1973) in which the speaker is a woman and the addressee an undefined 'you' (tu). Essentially, in the first books (Rich 1951,1955,1963), the addressee is mostly unspecified. In her textual strategies, Rich prefers a sort of imperson­ ality and detachment between the 'we' and the 'you'. This non-specificity and its function cannot be taken for granted; whenever the impersonal unknown, or generic addressee apears, the Spanish equivalent consistently selected is the masculine plural, as in "The Diamond Cutters" and "Ghost of a Chance". Both poems assert their context with the generic form (e.g. "you intelligence/

4. The Text is plural. Which is not simply to say that it has several mean- ings, but that it accomplishes the very plural of meaning: an irreducible (and not merely an acceptable) plural. The Text is not a co-­existence of meanings but a passage, an overcrossing; thus it answers not to an interpretation, even a liberal one, but to an explosion, a dissemination. The plural of the Text depends, that is, not on the ambiguity of its contents but on what might be called the stereographic plurality of its weave of signifiers (etymologically, the text is a tissue, a woven fabric). The reader of the Text may be compared to someone at a loose end (someone slackened off from any imaginary); this passably empty subject strolls—­it is what happened to the author of these lines, then it was that he had a vivid idea of the Text—­on the side of a valley, a oued2 flowing down below (oued is …

Here we have in either case but one person, first Oedipus, then Jocasta; but the expansion of number into the plural gives an impression of multiplied calamity. So in the following plurals— “There came forth Hectors, and there came Sarpedons.” And in those words of Plato’s (which we have already adduced elsewhere), referring to the Athenians: “We have no Pelopses or Cadmuses or Aegyptuses or Danauses, or any others out of all the mob of Hellenised barbarians, dwelling among us; no, this is the land of pure Greeks, with no mixture of foreign elements,”60 etc. Such an accumulation of words in the plural number necessarily gives greater pomp and sound to a subject. But we must only have recourse to this device when the nature of our theme makes it allowable to amplify, to multiply, or to speak in the tones of exaggeration or passion. To overlay every sentence with ornament61 is very pedantic. XXIV

ensures that the relation of subjectum to predicate is applied across the bOard, with no space left for indeterminacy, it is the conclusion that emerges as irrefutable in Descartes. The singular at one point, at this point, has be- come necessary in reconstructing the whole, and lays down the general grounds whereby the universal may be re-affirmed within a system of doubt methodically applied to every object. But the singular, it must be admitted, is of a particular kind here: it is the thinking substance that, moreover, turns back upon itself and fastens up the circle of (its) subjectivity. Once the primary identification has been achieved,-at least within the argument developed here-the possibility arises not only that the (Both the epigraph and the title of this essay are taken from the Fifth Discourse of Descartes's scientific treatise on refraction and telescopes, La Dio…

history, transcending and outliving its individual members. On the other hand it also means those individual members themselves, a col lection of ordinary, ever-changing people with their separate lives, interests and views. The English lan- guage matches this ambiguity with grammatical uncertainty. In English, most collective nouns can take either a. singular or a plural verb: 'the team has won the trophy' or 'the team have lost the match'.

concerned. In translating French material on a wolf (il) in the singu- lar or a lamb (il) in the singular­ – ­English has to decide whether the creature is an ‘it’ or a ‘person’­ – ­and if a person then which gender. In the plural (ils in French for any group which contains at least one creature or object gendered masculine) both people of either sex and objects are all conveyed by ‘they’, but wherever the singular indi- vidual is concerned English must convey a decision. French is carried along by grammar without such choices regarding personhood and sex having to be made until a particular animal is evoked whose sex needs to be highlighted. When Derrida or Hélène Cixous talk about the female cats they share their homes with, the personal pronouns oscillate between il referring to the cat (le chat) and elle referring to the female cat or pussy (la chatte)­ – ­while the translator will prob- ably render both il and elle by ‘she’.

SECOND DAY - AT NANCY'S H O M E to the question of being-without and entre-etre? I invented a dialogue for myself between you and Beckett, and especially with a short text written in French by Beckett with the title «Sans» 52• He translated this text into English himself, and called it «Lessness». Cioran discussed with him how the En­ glish title was so much better than the French one. The text is composed of 120 sentences, and the 61st and 62nd are a kind of reflexive mirror, a kind of polyphony, in which he aimed to sound as if six voices were sounding at the same time, to show the small displacements of this <putting-together>, to show this putting together in a paratactical, not a syntactical way, and so, in this sense, without ground. He wrote there: Ruines vrai refuge enfin vers lequel d'aussi loin par tant de faux. Lointains sans fin terre ciel confondus pas un bruit rien qui bouge.

especially when they use the pronoun “I”; they deny, they don’t know, they did nothing, they saw nothing. But as soon as Hatzfeld passes from the informal, singular “tu” form to the plural “you” (“vous”) form, the replies became more precise: “We advanced, we hit, we cut” (ibid., p. 155).

allowed a few comments on the formal aspects of the incident. Reference was made to "the Eislers", who were alleged to be doing, or not doing, something or other. In my opinion, the Lukacses ought to refrain from using such plurals when in fact there is only one Eisler among our musicians. The millions of white, yellow and black workers who have inherited the songs Eisler wrote for the masses will undoubtedly share my opinion here. But in addition there are all sorts of experts on music who think highly of Eisler's works, in which, so they tell me, he magnificently builds on and extends the cultural heritage of German music, and they would be very confused if the German emigres should seek to outdo the seven cities of Greece, who quarrelled about which of them had produced a single Homer, by allowing themselves to start boasting that they had seven Eislers.' When the essay was revised for republication in book-form (Aufbau, Berlin 1948) Lukacs rewrote the sentence

‘method’ even – has been to coin new heterogeneous nouns to see what alternative relations, connections, might be revealed, to embark upon the development of uncommon verbs and prepositions. Consequently, I have reiﬁed strange nouns in order to ‘ﬂuidify’ relations and prepositions. It would seem, then, that reiﬁcation does have its uses (see below). But, at the same time, we must be careful that such reiﬁcation has not produced stories that are too neat, too secure, too ‘impositional’, that, in sum, end up occluding the ﬂuidity of co(a)gents (cf. Law, 1994, 1999) that is supposed to be revealed. Of course, this sensitivity to the interwovenness of reiﬁcation and ﬂuidity echoes others’ work, most notably the partial distinctions drawn between root and rhizome, and territorialization and deterritorialization by Deleuze and Guattari (1983, 1988; see also Latour, 1999b; Lee and Brown, 1994; Wise, 1997).

or to speak in the tones of exaggeration or passion. To overlay every sentence with ornament61 is very pedantic. XXIV On the other hand, the contraction of plurals into singulars sometimes creates an appearance of great dignity; as in that phrase of Demosthenes: “Thereupon all Peloponnesus was divided.”62 There is another in Herodotus: “When Phrynichus brought a drama on the stage entitled The Taking of Miletus, the whole theatre fell a weeping”—instead of “all the spectators.” This knitting together of a number of scattered particulars into one whole gives them an aspect of corporate life. And the beauty of both uses lies, I think, in their betokening emotion, by giving a sudden change of complexion to the circumstances,—whether a word which is strictly singular is

stances, between nostalgia for closure and the experience of its dissolution. He suggests that Bonnefoy’s use of the coupe articulates this tension (Jean-Luc Nancy, ‘Nécessité du sens’, in Yves Bonnefoy. Poésie, peinture, musique, ed. Michèle Finck (Strasbourg: Presses Universitaires de Strasbourg, 1995), pp. 49–50). 34 We see the same kind of static approach in Nancy’s essay on Deguy’s poetry and the dis- tinction that he makes between ‘precision’ and ‘exactitude’. Nancy suggests that precision seeks to approach the thing in question and believes it can accede to its presence. He then observes that ‘l’exactitude est l’exigence – c’est son etymon – l’exigence “exagie”, accomplie, à terme, sans reste: la stricte observance de la chose, de sa présence, sans le moindre écart. La chose n’est pas approchée, ni rapprochée: elle reste à son ailleurs, au lointain de son être’ (Jean-Luc N…

Derrida tells his audience that there are three heterogeneous parts to this term. The first is that in French the plural is heard in the singular noun which expresses neither all animals except man in one, nor man plus animals in one, thus there is a multiplicity of limits and heterogeneous structures. Confusing all non-human living beings in one common and general category ‘the animal’ is a crime, ‘a crime of the first order against the animals, against animals’ (The Animal That Therefore I Am, 48) (‘un premier crime contre les animaux, contre des animaux’ (L’Animal que donc je suis, 73)).

the order of discourse is constructed by means of the logic of the One/the Same, the act of replacing this order of the one by the two of sexual difference necessitates the re-imagination of all the figures of philosophical discourse. Or as Luce Irigaray's describes it: Replacing the one by the two in sexual difference thus constitutes a decisive philosophical and political gesture, one which gives up a singular or plural being (l'être un ou pluriel) in order to become a dual being (l'être deux). This is the necessary foundation for a new ontology, a new ethics, and a new politics, in which the other is recognized as other and not as the same: bigger or smaller than I, or at best my equal.2 2 Irigaray, L (1995), 'The Question of the Other', in: Lynne Huffer (ed), Another Look, Another Woman.

In the expression “constitutional-pluralistic,” the hyphen enabled each of these two notions to reverberate conditionally on the other, so that—as in another political-constitutional hy¬ phenated concept, the “king-in-parliament”—once associated in a new logical structure they could not be separated again; and only when united did they form a new, integrated, and integral, concept. For what the hyphen shows is that whereas all socie¬ ties are pluralistic regardless of their political regimes, there are some in which the economic, social, and political pluralism of the society is guaranteed by the constitution; and, vice-versa, the continuous functioning of the pluralistic society will see to it that the constitution will be observed.

Because the letter itself stages this dis- placement of the ﬁrst-person ‘‘we’’ in which it is written, the further shift to the ﬁrst-person singular in what’s often thought of as the beginning of ALP’s ‘‘monologue’’/‘‘epilogue’’ (‘‘Soft morning, city!

There are no universal linguistic structures in the brain of the speaking subject; rather, every era has its specific needs, creates its own ideals, and imposes them as such. Some are more his- torically durable than others: sexual ideals are a good example here. These ideals have gradually imposed their norms on our language. Hence, in French: 1.

but on each occasion it is the law within the law, and on each occasion outside the law within the law. That's it, that so very singular thing that is called the laws of hospitality. Strange plural, plural grammar of two plurals that are diferent at the same time. One of these two plurals says the laws of hospitality, condi­ tional laws, etc. The other plural says the antinomic addition, the one that adds conditional laws to the unique and singular and absolutely only great Law of hospitality, to the law of hospitality, to the categori­ cal imperative of hospitality. In this second case, the plural is made up of One + a multiplicity, whereas in the first case, it was only multiplicity, distribution, differentiation. In one case, you have One + n; in the other, n + n + n, etc. (Let us note parenthetically that as a quasi-synonym for "unconditional," the Kant­ ian expression of "categorical imperative" is not un­ problematic; we will keep it with some reservations, 81

prefix is often ignored. The translators of Being Singular Plural choose a whole range of words that evade the importance of this prefix (for example: ‘appearance’100 in lieu of ‘sur-gissement’101). It is perhaps here that we must return to Malabou’s work. What does Malabou say about this tension? Could it be the tension that sustains plasticity/voir venir? Is Nancy’s emphasis on the prefix sur- in survenue, surprise the same as Malabou’s surprise? The rapprochement between the two thinkers is too complex to be undertaken here. What can be said – extremely briefly – is perhaps this: as noted in the previous chapter in relation to Malabou’s work on Hegel, the word ‘surprise’ signifies something that seizes or holds excessively (as Malabou notes, it is ‘un excès de prise’102). Malabou therefore already emphasizes the tension that characterizes the crucial role of surprise in relation to bo…

None of this is necessarily confusing, but readers do need to be attentive-especially given that the word "being" is also the translation of etant, although in this case I have consistently used the plural "be­ ings" wherever possible (and Badiou does usually employ the plural etants rather than the singular l'etant), whereas in all instances where it was necessary to respect the singular form, I have used an indefinite article or a particularizing adjective ("a being," or "a singular being") to avoid any confusion. That said, there is one occur­ rence in the text where the expression "a being" translates un etre and not un etant, but the context (Badiou speaks in this instance of "a being of the simulacrum" [po 36]) should prevent any misunderstanding. Finally, considerations of consistency in

and the clarity of things” [EI: 122/86—87]. The sense of difficulty in Her- aclitus’s language, which Blanchot seems to adopt, comes from this under- standing that words, no less than things themselves, have their own complexity, for at one moment “it is the thing that represents the movement towards dispersion, and the name that says unity, and at another, “it is the name that pluralises the one thing, and language, far from gathering, dis- perses” [EI: 128/90]. His writing “is thus written in proximity to surround- ing things, coming to terms with them [sexpliquant avec elles] ina movement that goes from them to words, then from words to them, according to a new relation of contrariety that we are powerless to master once and for all, but that makes us hear—concretely—this mysterious relation existing between writing and the /ogos” [EI: 125/88]. The play of light and dark in Blanchot’s language is nothing less than its negotiation of the relation

translations-across languages, across geography, across time-making impossible the work's singularity. If "the plurality of languages," according to Johnson, makes "the 'one' impossible," this practice of insubordinating translation can welcome that plurality, give it its due. I am completely persuaded by Mather Tangues as to how "the plurality of languag- es" makes "the 'one' impossible." I have more trouble, however, as 1 suggested earlier, with the move from "the plurality of languages" to "the plurality of sexes." One sign of the difficulty of that analogy (or maybe its excessive ease) is the sentence from the last paragraph of the first chapter that immediately follows the one I began this paper with. After Johnson says, "the plurality of languages and the plurality of sexes are alike in that they both make the 'one' impossible," she then says: "Two and two thousand are Je…

“authors themselves,” not only from capitalized to lower- case, but from singular to plural. The passage is in fact all one sentence, and in the course of this sentence (a very long sentence, to be sure) we move from the Author that we are beyond to authors that are beyond us, as if the sentence itself enacts the turn in Barthes’s re- lation to the author. And as we reach this new relation to authors (lowercase, plural), Barthes names two examples: Proust and Jean Genet. While “The Author” belongs to the past (“decrepit,” vétuste, timeworn), the “authors”—despite being historical figures— belong to the future. Past and future here are not literary but critical. “The Author” belongs to the old criticism; the “authors” are models for the criticism of the future. The task envisioned for future critics has “already been” achieved by these authors; it has already been “recounted,” i.e., narrated; the model for criti-

Plurals Page 39 of 42 (34) Higginbotham (1998, 2000) appears to invoke such considerations when he says that there seems to be nothing predicational about the plural demonstrative when the speaker waves his hand at some boys, saying ‘They built a boat yesterday’. Even if the speaker thinks ‘They—the only things in that corner of the room that could have built a boat—built a boat yesterday’, he cannot be taken to have intended to communicate this thought or to be disappointed if the hearer understands instead ‘They—the only things that this schmuck could be referring to without telling me what he is referring to—built a boat yesterday’. Verbs too are acquired demonstratively, without intervention from anything ‘predicational’, as when a clarinet sounds in demonstration of a nonce verb to chalumeau or John Cleese displays the meaning of to Silly‐Walk relying on the learner's exquisite but …

into many languages and has even more translators. By the last count, her books exist in at least nine languages in addition to French: English, Spanish, German, Italian, Dutch, Japanese, Portuguese, Dutch, and Turkish. While Malabou may no longer need English translation, her translators, for their part, must work as a team to keep up with this prolific author. In English, I am just one of the six translators of her books, along with Lisabeth During, Steven Miller, Sebastian Rand, Peter Skafish, and David Wills. This veritable Malabou translation industry invites reflection on how her work in English participates in a well-established tradition, namely, the manufacture of French thought for and/or by Anglo-American academia. In the light of a significant French cultural policy that both promotes and funds translations, and the long-standing relationship between American scholarship and French thought, this history is one of the reasons to
