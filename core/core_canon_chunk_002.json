      "text": "sontag, suffering, and the work of writing 81 form.24 From the vantage point of the early twenty-first century, Sontag now believes that our collective failure to comprehend the suffering of war is due to several factors: the scale of suffering that photographs now enable us to see; the skepticism in which we are inculcated; and the passivity that images of suffering and skepticism together promote. As an essayist, she builds here on what she learned from writing realist, historical novels, which required that she focus on the particular. She places blame for failures of understanding on how photography functions in specific situations, not on the medium itself. Images of suffering, she says, “cannot be more than an invitation to pay attention, to reflect, to learn, to examine the rationalizations for mass suffering offered by established powers” (117). Certainly, one inspira…",

Here the postmodernism of Judith Butler, the posthuman- ism of Katherine Hayles, and the companionism of Donna Haraway represent possible pathways to the posthuman future—pathways that both follow a logic of descent into the complexities of contem- porary history and yet draw into presence a posthuman future still in the process of revealing itself. Always an uneasy convergence of opposing tendencies—received material histories of the body deeply marked by questions of class, race, and gender versus a future of increasingly virtualized body experiences—the posthuman future",

Psychoanalysis itself and desire: pages of analysis beckon on this topic, insofar as Derrida’s writings are concerned. To limit ourselves to just one example: in Archive Fever, psychoanalysis emerges as a thinking of the archive which struggles to detach itself securely from the desired object of its thought – which is to say, the object of its desire. (Psychoanalysis, then, is irreducibly both archivo-analysis and archive fever.) In one respect, psychoanalysis’s desires cannot be read outside of the psychoanalytic interpretation of desire – although equally, the always supplementary force of desire means that the analysis of psychoanalytic desire cannot remain confined within the framework of a neat parallel between pyschoanalysis’s desires, on the one hand, and the psycho-",

For plausible reasons, the Artwork essay has been understood-and has been used-as both condensation and emblem of what Benjamin's ad- mirers find most typical of his intellectual style: a familiarity with, and active interest in, the cultural phenomena of his own time; an awe- inspiring depth of historical knowledge; a fascination with \"facts\" in all of their factual bluntness; a passion for the joy of speculation re- mindful of the great protagonists of German Idealism; a commitment to political causes of the Left that does not narr…",

Performativity: feminist queer theorist Judith Butler utilises performativity to theorise the ‘doing of gender’ as a way to understand subjectivity. In her book Gender Trouble (1990) Butler argues that ‘gender is not a noun, neither is it a set of free-ﬂoating attributes . . . gender is performa- tivity produced and compelled by the regulatory practices of gender coherence. Gender is always doing . . . ’ Further- more, gender identity is the expression of performing gen- der and nothing more than this (25).

According to Mulvey, in classic narrative cinema, the viewer occupies a masculine position; he is aligned with the agency and desire of the onscreen male hero. The position of femininity, on the other hand, is a matter of embodiment rather than subjectivity: the woman on screen connotes what Mulvey terms ‘to-be-looked-at-ness’.19 This theoretical model, designed to describe mainstream narrative cinema has obvious resonances with some of the anti-porn feminist accounts discussed at th…",

By way of contrast, Merleau-Ponty turns the contents of consciousness outwards, into a consciousness of one’s body that is experienced as a postural schema or the perception of a bodily orientation in relationship to the world. Similarly, the perception of others and the sharing of perceptual experience is possible, not because the bodies of others are recognisable as projections of one’s own body, but because they have a perceivable comportment and intentionality as relationships that are translatable between bodies.

Psychology is time and again attacked for its objectify- ing qualities, and much the same is alleged of the self-objectifying ego’s captivation in images. Psychology itself is thus likened to the ego, viewed, indeed, as itself as egoic. We may take this argument further by consider- ing the elementary features of Lacan’s mirror-stage. The mirror stage involves the imaginary dynamics of the subject looking at, and as intrigued by, an image that they subsequently come to take on as themselves (as the basis of their ideal-ego).

I want to suggest here, cautiously, and tentatively, that an ethics of responding to pain involves being open to being affected by that which one cannot know or feel. Such an ethics is, in this sense, bound up with the sociality or the ‘contingent attach- ment’ of pain itself. Much of the thinking on pain, however, contrasts the ungraspability of the other’s pain with the graspability of my own pain. Elaine Scarry makes this contrast in her analysis of pain and torture (1985: 4). Certainly, there is something ungraspable about the other’s pain, and this is not just because I do not feel it. But my pain, even when I feel it, is not",

More to the point, the breakup of women as a coherent group is attributable to feminism itself: feminism is a political movement that has striven to unite women in a struggle for freedom largely by refut- ing the naturalized femininity on which the illusion of a given, common identity of women is based. Rather than willfully destroy the category of women, then, thinkers like Butler, Mouffe, and Scott tried to clarify—in deeply critical and non-nostalgic terms—the political consequences of its historical loss for the future of feminism. Trying to understand the pathos of the category of women debates, I began to think it might be symptomatic of the epistemological framework",

On the ontological level, what is demonic about this project is its uncanny coupling of absolutely incommensurable elements: the negative and the positive, the transcendent and the immanent, scarcity and plenitude, etc. On the ontic level, the demonic nature of the modern state is owing to the conﬂuence of the murderous power of the sovereign’s sword and the productive, vitalist power of biopolitics.

Here, the desire for mastery is nothing but the disguised articulation of another desire—the desire occasioned by the impossible object. The desire for mastery is itself never primary but always the displace- ment of another desire. If we think of desire in terms of mastery, we submit ourselves to the subject’s own self-deception. In Lacan’s conception of desire, the gaze is not the vehicle through which the subject masters the object but a point in the Other that resists the mastery of vision. It is a blank spot in the subject’s look, a blank spot that threatens the subject’s sense of mastery in looking because the subject cannot see it directly or successfully integrate it into the rest of its visual field. This is because…",

As I hope to show here, it is the combination of these aspira- tions and their location in a free market of sexual encounters which creates new forms of emotional domination of women by men.

For the movement-image, going back into the past is a way of fixing what happened in the past, of being certain about it, and thus of making clear connections between the past and the present. For the time-image, by contrast, one goes back into the past, but one is uncertain what one will find there, and the past will prove to be changeable and—perhaps even more provocatively—open to invention.

The game consists of combinations of the symbols contained within programmes. The player, the human user, the photographer, the television owner, the cinema goer, becomes a functionary within this system. He tries to learn the apparatus’ rules and eventually learns to think through them.

It indicates the point of absence that arouses our desire because we associate it with a lost enjoyment that we are incapable of finding present anywhere in the world. No empirical object provides this enjoyment, but the objet a suggests its possibility to us. The objet a takes on different forms.

There are excellent reasons for this refusal of the woman to look, not the least of which is that she is often asked to bear witness to her own powerlessness in the face of rape, mutilation and murder. Another excellent reason for the refusal to look is the fact that women are given so little to identify with on the screen. Laura Mulvey’s extremely inﬂuential article on visual pleasure in narrative cinema has best deﬁned this problem in terms of a dominant male look at the woman that leaves no place for the woman’s own pleasure in seeing: she exists only to be looked at.1 Like the female spectator, the female protagonist often fails to look, to return the gaze of",

That dread then is an important obstacle to be confronted when attempting to think how best to negotiate the challenges of the Anthropocene. Whereas Thacker is concerned with how horror lets us address limitations on human thought—it is about the “paradoxical thought of the unthinkable” (9)—my argument is that the Gothic genre lets us contem- plate a world in which the human holds no privileged place.

This base of eroticism for Bataille and others who followed in his think- ing issued forth from a clear and distinct consciousness. In this work, I attempt to reconceive the erotic, its imaginative manifestations and an aesthetic which is ultimately brought about through desire’s disruption.

One of this book’s central claims is that the present is perceived, first, affectively: the present is what makes itself present to us before it becomes anything else, such as an orchestrated collective event or an epoch on which we can look back. (Chapter 2, “Intuitionists,” describes this way of thinking about “the affective present” in Marxist critical theory.) If the present is not at first an object but a mediated affect, it is also a thing that is sensed and under constant revision, a temporal genre whose conventions emerge from the personal and public filtering of the situations and events that are happening in an extended now whose very parameters (when did “the present” begin?) are also always there for debate.3 Disc…",

As the art historian John Berger had recently and succinctly pointed out 'men act and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at' (Berger 1972, p. 47). Mulvey's essay marked a huge conceptual leap in film theory: a jump from the ungendered and for- malistic analyses of semiotics to the understanding that film viewing always involves gendered identities. Hugely influential as it was, critics, nevertheless did attack the essay's apparent ahistorical, totalising construction and, as a result, Mulvey went on substantially to revise her assessment in later work (Cowie",

The girl bypasses the gender binary. She highlights, if not creates, the asymmetric position of the female in relation to the male. This is why the girl is a great point of departure when issues surrounding gender have to get revised, analyzed, fought, or undone. In this respect, I follow Luce Irigaray’s argument that the “woman” must be considered through the “modalities” of mother and daughter, and I agree as well that a strong emphasis must be placed on the intergenerational factor as a logical pre- requisite that works like a bond or (affective) link.

These confusions become particularly acute for the late eighteenth century, in which the pleasurable perception of others' pain was colliding with the distressing perception of one's own odious pain. The dualism that Scarry suggests exists in pain can be read as part of a Romantic dualism of self-perception, one that depends upon nociception at the same time that it tries to eradicate it.

Acoustic imagination knows no boundaries: you can hear a wall or a room; you can create spaces that do not exist; sound signals a breakdown, a welcomed posthuman turn away from language. Finally, sound’s relationship to computational art and cul- ture is far from new. However, the proliferation of digital media has played a critical role in further developing alternative ideas of the relationship between sound, body, space, and machine. The Rhythmic Event explores this sonic dimension and the dynamic engagement that it affords with the speculative and potential aspects of the event. A central question for the book is whether recent new media art experiments—particularly what falls under the broader sonic realm—can suggest alternative modes of perception, temporality,…",

Butler is interested in expanding the domains of legibility for those who violate the norms of gender and sexuality, and doing so without appeal to a shared sense of identity. That expansion cannot be achieved by simply enumerating a list of gender configurations that might supplement male and female, since such a list would quickly become proscriptive or positivist. Butler wants to secure gender as an open site of as yet unarticulated possibility in order to resist the kind of foundationalism or ontological thralldom that would restrict the realm of the possible to its normative iterations.

And, in some cases, as Byatt does in Possession, they acknowledge the dangers of eros, in the classical sense. Before I outline the major theses in regard to the use of creative eros, I consider the ways in which Byatt’s Possession withholds explicit sexual scenes, a strategy that the other works in this study generally employ.

For Grosz, all bodies are virtualities of this dynamism; they are images in process, lines of flight to the future. This dynamism, which Cheah has referred to as the subindividual, finite forces of mattering, is for Grosz the de- siring of postpersonal thought. Her work on bodies turns into the thought of bodies as desiring production, bodies as machinic assem- blages, bodies as the movement of forces. For example, her treatment of architecture suggests a shift from the structural to the mobile, to the speed of flows of singularities into and through bodies, where desire is the movement.

The image seems to be better than us and is external to ourselves, so this identiﬁcation is problematic in itself. This process is the Mirror Phase and it allows us to enter into the realm of the Imaginary – with the emphasis being on the idea of the image. This Mirror Phase can act as a metaphor for what we do in the cinema – and this idea was developed by Christian Metz.We sit in the dark, quietly (Metz clearly doesn’t go to your average multiplex), and don’t move, whilst watching an image of a person who is much bigger, stronger, more intelligent, braver and more",

Bataille insists that the economic problem needs to be conceived as an existential one. Such an attempt would leave behind the “classical economy” that concentrates on the pursuit of surplus to be invested in growth, thereby missing the general existential problem: that the essence of the biomass is such that it “must constantly destroy (consume) a surplus of energy” (Bataille 1991a, 182). Here I think that Bataille responds to existentialism by raising the question of the economy of existence. The existence of a human being cannot be explained only by the restricted econo- my of the world—by concentrating solely on the way the individual is situat- ed in facticity as a member of a class, race, and sex. We must also take into account the subject’s rootedness in the general economy of life.",

The theory of the male gaze became the framework for a feminist critique of representation, both in art and criticism of the 1980s.

Butler’s performatives The latest moment of this little history of the performative is the emergence of a ‘performative theory of gender and sexuality’ in feminist theory and in gay and lesbian studies. The key ﬁgure here is the American philosopher Judith Butler, whose books Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (1990), Bodies that Matter (1993), and Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Speech Act (1997), have had great inﬂuence in the ﬁeld of literary and cultural studies, particularly in feminist theory, and in the emerging ﬁeld of gay and lesbian studies.

At least in part, this was determined by Derrida’s own relationship with Lacan’s texts, and the peculiar dif- ferences between this relationship and those which Derrida maintains with others of his contemporaries. It is noticeable that there is a certain haste and at the same time an incompleteness about Derrida’s relations with Lacan. It is as if he engaged with this contemporary earlier than anyone else and persistently throughout his œuvre, but without ever getting to grips with his work. This haste and this lack do not charac- terise his relations with others, such as Habermas and Nancy, which came much later, and others that often occurred only posthumously.

A key for understanding is given too late. There are continuous slippages. It is either as if Kafka could not tolerate such cruelty or as if he told himself the story.

These books offered a remarkable account of cinema history and theory, all informed not only by Deleuze’s many years of writing philosophy but also by his love of cinema. He offered conceptions of cinema that were original and provocative, and which went against the grain of the cinema scholarship of the period. We might first of all ask, what does Deleuze mean by the movement-image and the time-image? These formulations were daring. They challenged the reigning film theory orthodoxies of the 1970s and 1980s.

Through a painstaking analy- sis of the speciﬁc damage that torture does to human bodies and psy- ches as well as the power dynamic that necessarily develops between the torturer and the person being tortured, Scarry delivers a searing indictment of the tremendous damage torture does to human struc- tures of culture and community as well as to individuals. She argues that because pain happens so profoundly within a single body, it is never communicable from the person suffering it to other people, and that profound pain actually destroys language because it is so heavily em- bodied that it breaks the conscious ability to articulate anything beyond unintelligible sounds. As such, she argues that the very invisibility of pain allows us largely to divorce ourselves from res…",

For Freud satisfaction comes with a reduction in the levels of tension. Our desires are manifestations of libidinal or destructive drives of which our particular goals are merely instances. Alternatively these drives get sublimated into objects, which strike us as attractive in themselves, yet turn out to be a replaying of the Oedipal drama. For Lacan satisfaction, although unachievable, is a state of fullness or plenitude. Our desiring activities originate in the sense of lack which the absence of such plenitude evokes. Within a model which sees the aim of desire as satisfaction, and also sees satisfaction as a state of plenitude which generates no further demands, it is clear why, to maintain subjectivity, our objects of demand must be permanently mismatched with what would provide such satisfaction.",

According to James Hatley, for Lévinas, the face manifests itself through its ‘nudity’ (that is, its vulnerability to violence). Hatley explains that ‘nudity’ for Lévinas means [a] non-form, abandon of self, ageing, dying . . . poverty, skin with wrinkles.

What is quite fascinating about this shift in the direction of sexual difference by Irigaray is that it is approved, even condoned, as essentialist, by her erstwhile defender against this charge, Rosi Braidotti. Earlier in this chapter, I discussed how Braidotti, together with Grosz, supported Irigaray’s use of the motif of ‘two lips’ not as essentialist but as a deconstructive device. In this context, however, the ground has shifted, and Braidotti now supports use of the word ‘essentialism’, as it is linked with sexual difference. This is a remarkable change, and in need of a detailed assessment, for I believe that it can provide insights into both the mixed reception of Irigaray and a discrepancy at the heart of her enterprise. Braidotti will now claim that the postulate of sexual difference is a crucial and",

While this is the case especially for the later poststructuralist theories of sexuality, perhaps largely due to their relative disconnection from concrete practices, the legacy of Simone de Beauvoir’s essay on love in her famous The second sex (1949/1989) did reverberate in some of the second wave feminist thinking, notably in radical feminist work. When Beauvoir’s existentialist take on love under patri- archy was that women’s love of men constituted an instance of mauvais fois , locking women in immanence, the recurrent theme of second wave discourses on heterosexual love was that it was a kind of delusion or false consciousness, ensuring that women keep submitting themselves to their masters (see Douglas, 1990 , for an overview).

With her “two lips” conceit, Irigaray deftly alters this psychoan- alytic tale, beginning with the assumption, attributed to the little girl, that there is only one sex organ.

Arguing that in the discourses of modernity, corporeality has been, in Elizabeth Grosz's phrase, `coded feminine', so that `[p]atriarchal oppression . . . justifies itself, at least in part, by connecting women much more closely than men to the body and, through this identification, restricting women's social and economic roles' (Grosz 1994: 14), feminists have analysed the ways in which cultural structures have functioned both to confine women to their objectified and passive bodies and to estrange them from their bodies. In later studies, the work of Michel Foucault has been used to argue that women's bodies are subject to very specific disciplinary controls through",

The fact that Deleuze, like Foucault, hardly engages with women’s liberation prompts Braidotti to ask whether “Deleuze becomes normative by omission.” “When this ‘becoming woman’ is disembodied to the extent that it bears no connection to the struggles, the experience, the discursivity of real-life women, what good is it for feminist practice?” (Braidotti 1991i, pp. 120–1; cf. Grosz 1993, p. 179). With the benefit of hindsight, the question is, of course, whether this early negative critique was potentially a little premature on the part of feminists, who, in throwing the baby away with the bathwater, lost the opportunity to develop a Deleuzean feminism. However, early on, and elsewhere in Patterns of Dissonance itself, Braidotti actually engages the Deleuzean feminist project and claims that Deleuze’s philosophy of becoming shifts the Hegelianism deemed responsible …",

Campion’s reluctance to claim the term “feminist filmmaker” stems in part from the prescriptive nature of feminism and feminist film theory in the 1970s and 1980s. This prescriptive dimension of feminist film theory manifested itself most conspicuously in the work surrounding Laura Mulvey, with its insistence on combating patriarchal narrative and filmic conventions with new feminist alternatives. In “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,” Mulvey explains the process of viewer identification, in which the viewer identifies with the male hero because the camera identifies with the male hero. The camera focuses on what the male hero is looking at and to this extent also follows the active male hero through the filmic text. This camera/male hero alignment forces the woman into the position of the object of the male gaze. Mulvey’s…",

The concept of signifiance moved beyond the Text (in any sense of a material trace) to a methodological field where language is a structuring force, in an attempt to offer an account of the relationship between the subject and the text. Kristeva postulated the idea of the ‘subject in process’ where: signifiance is an alternative signifying process that is the result of the heterogenous workings of language which articulates both symbolic and semiotic dispositions.

Such a position, which is critical of scientific assumptions and methods from a perspective within the sciences, is well represented in this volume by Lesley Rogers who challenges a number of inferences pervasive to sociobiological, genetic and physiological research regarding sexual differences. She is concerned with the ways in which scientific research accords with stereotypical social representations of the two sexes rather than, as is commonly pre- sumed, social images finding their ‘truth’ in independently estab- lished scientific statements. She argues that although we are cate-",

As Avital Ronell (2011) puts it, ‘Kittler commands a huge area that connects so much thought from the eighteenth century to the twenty-first century—and we can’t avoid his work’. Though perhaps Kittler himself would reject any suggestion that there is ‘media after Kittler’, that is to say any media after (digital) media, this is an attempt to develop an understanding of concrete media systems, practices and techniques and of the abstract zones of media- tion that affect us and are affected by us in nonconscious ways. Ulti- mately, the value of passing through Kittler in order to do so lies in his ability to identify the complete absence of a media ontology in Western thought. The present volume engages with this effort to bring forth what is largely overlooked and left behind in mainstream approaches to media theory and, paraphrasing Spinoza, to ponder over the idea that we do not know what media can do.

Humans, while distinct from animals, rocks, tumbleweeds, and bath robes, are not more ontologi­ cally significant. All objects are always-already entangled with their sur­ rounding objects, creating phenomena rather than individuals. The second clue, built on quantum physics, is that entangled objects (including humans), take part in the ongoing performance of the world as a continual articulation of difference. For Barad, this articulation of the world “is not a human-dependent characteristic but a feature of the world in its differ­ ential becoming. The world articulates itself differently” (Barad 2007,",

Recognizing that the mother tongue has become a powerful and problematic metaphor for feminists does not necessarily entail that we shun it altogether. It comes as no surprise to me that many feminist critics have turned to the figures of mother and mother tongues to elaborate a different kind and quality of writing. Nor is it surprising that feminist discourse itself has relied on the grand metaphors of father and mother to articulate the workings of systems of oppression. The striving for a different language, for alternative modes of writing, may work through the maternal metaphor because this striving is for a more fully embodied language, and the mother's body provides rich resources for such an undertaking.

In Chapter 5 I highlight the prob- lems of the ‘strategic essentialism’ used by Butler and others as a way of retaining universalizing categories for political purposes while rejecting their ontological basis.

She argues that there are two forms of looking involved in the specta- tor’s relationship with the screen. One is active scopophilia, which uses another person as an erotic object and in which the subject’s identity is different from and distanced from the object on the screen. The other arises from narcissism and the formation of the ego, where the spectator identifies with their on-screen likeness (Mulvey 1989c: 18).

Once again Kristeva employs her double strategy for bringing the body back into the structure of language. She argues both that the logic of language is already operating within this semiotic disposition and that the semiotic disposition makes its way into language.

Representations of death in art are so pleasing, it seems, because they occur in a realm clearly delineated as not life, or not real, even as they refer to the basic fact of life we know but choose not to acknowledge too overtly.

While Malabou is interested in how these bodies necessarily reinvent the categories of psychoanalysis, for us they also point to the limits of Hayles’s distinction between cognizers and noncognizers, and how—while Hayles subverts the typical privileging of human over nonhuman agency—new lines can be drawn that mark some lives as of greater significance than others when we turn to the brain. One of Malabou’s major concerns is how to theorize the brain and thought in a way that does not simply reproduce models that parallel neoliberal capitalism (2008). Neoliberalism is often characterized by networks that maintain flexibility in their relations, in which temporary projects are the norm (see Harvey 1990). Malabou notes that common ways of describing the brain seem to follow these same terms. The links between neurons are “flexible,” th…",

Bartky examines the twin perils of, on the one hand, a condescending ‘sympathy’ from on high that reduces the one who suffers to a passive object and, on the other, an ‘empathy’ in which over-identification with the sufferer dissolves the empathizer’s own subjective boundaries and obliterates respect for differ- ences. Drawing on the less-known phenom- enology of Max Scheler (1874–1928), and using the example of her own reading of Nawal El Sadawi’s account of her violent subjection to clitoridectomy as a young child (El Sadawi, 1980), Bartky elucidates a third mode of experiencing the suffering of others that (with Scheler) she calls ‘feeling- with’. Here neither objectification nor over- identification takes place.

Bergson thus presents us with two fundamentally different media for organizing the multiple nature of the given: a discrete multiplicity is defined by juxtaposition and space; a continuous multiplicity is defined by interpenetration and time. The first produces homogeneous quan- tities, the second heterogeneous qualities. One gives us a mechanical aggregate of separate events, the other a dynamic, organic whole.

Empiricism construes the body as having a causal role in perception in so far as the body is regarded as an object from which responses are elicited. In consciousness-based formulations perception is reducible to the action of a thinking mind which exists as an external spectator capable of synthesis and reflection. Taking issue with the ideal viewpoint of a mind full of concepts, judgements and relations, Merleau-Ponty regards the specular as an essentially incarnate reality, bound to and produced within a corporeal and social context (1968: 235).

In political work, this position is particularly clearly illustrated by the ‘enchanted’ or ‘vital’ materialism of Bennett (2010) who argues that inorganic matter, such as litter (trash) or an electricity grid, all exhibit force and vitality rendering them active, productive and self-creating. Bennett argues for a vital materialism in order to recognise the role of apparently inanimate matter affecting and configuring situations and events. The vitality",

How is this possible while retaining her insignifi- cance? Rather than resolving this paradox, Lispector uses it to push the limits of the web of aesthetically mediated relationships surrounding Macabéa— relationships that are organized with the help of the concept of beauty. In challenging such aesthetic relationships, Lispector rewrites the connections of the beautiful and the ugly with the feminine, the body, the postcolonial, and race, and directs us toward an alternative economy of beauty. The force of Lispector’s cultural critique stands out when considered in light of the relational frames in which philosophers historically have cast the beautiful.

There is, first, a mimetic violence: the representation of dominating or aggressive interactions between men and women, often set in the family or placed within larger systems of social and even racial oppression. In her refusal to see women simply as innocent victims, Lispector runs counter to a major ten- dency in feminist thought that Jessica Benjamin also opposes: the construction of ‘‘the problem of domination as a drama of female vulnerability victimized by male aggression” (Benjamin 1988, 9).

Irigaray herself has spoken at times as if life in general, even the elements themselves, were sexuate: “No world is produced or reproduced without sexed difference. Plants, animals, gods, the elements of the universe, all are sexed.”18 Yet, given Irigaray’s later characterization of even plant life as neu- ter or nonsexuate,19 and the persistent concern in her philosophical corpus to examine the sexuate specificities of the body, it seems implausible to read such conceptual abstractness into her account of sexual difference. For Iri- garay, a rethinking of sexual difference may require a rethinking of space and time, the elements, and life itself against phallocentric accounts; the horizons of experience and the imaginaries by which we conceive being may be sexually differentiated. We do not therefore imply that sexual difference is being as such.",

People who fail to ‘do’ gender correctly, she argues, are punished by cultures and laws which have a vested interest in maintaining a stable distinction between masculine and feminine; a vested interest in positioning idealised constructions of woman and man as natural and uncontestable.

Although much has been written about Clarice Lispector, her work remains, in an overall sense, largely an enigma to us. This is so, I believe, because of the elusive and ambiguous nature of her escritura, the great bulk of which struggles, directly and indirectly, with the twin problems of meaning and communication in human existence. Given the com- plexity of these issues, Inspector's reader is forced to confront her nar- ratives from a number of interrelated critical and philosophical perspec- tives, among which the issue of language, in its peculiar relationship to both knowing (epistemology) and being (ontology), emerges as the de- cisive factor.

As in the case of Badiou, it is Meillassoux’s insistence on tethering the value of humanity to its capacity for thought that lies at the root of many of the problems of his anthropology, and it is in an attempt to move beyond this host capacity approach that I consider, in Chapter 3, the thought of Catherine Malabou. The transition from Badiou and Meillassoux to Malabou leads us away from a host capacity and to a host substance, namely the human brain. Chapter 3 argues that Malabou manages to avoid a host capacity account of the human by laying out, in her reading of Hegel, a notion of plastic- ity not as a uniquely human trait but as the possible transformation of all traits. This position harbours an irreducible ambiguity, however, between an escape from the host capacities approach and its hyperbolisation, and",

In these analyses, Agamben undermines a reading of Aristotle that attempts to prioritise one term of the opposition, focusing on the mechanism that divides the two terms from one another.

In his analysis of politics in Homo Sacer and “The Work of Man”, Agamben argues that the originary moment of politics is not zoe¯ as a pre-political natural life, but, rather, the conceptual caesurae through which Aristotle divides the continuum of life, separating out zoe¯, as the most general mode in which life appears, as a ground for other, more speciﬁ c forms of life.

The conditions of the possibility of the inclusive exclusion of the bare life of human beings are the same as those that allow for the presupposition of pure being in metaphys­ ics. Cancelling these metaphysical conditions, then, will require a politicised rethinking of the ontological category of pure being, and a properly thinking politics.

As I showed in the previous paragraph, Luce Irigaray holds the opinion that the love between beloved lovers of the same sex will not produce this extase instante, this communion in pleasure which she calls 'a child prior to any child'. Although Luce Irigaray does not offer any arguments for this opinion, it can be traced to her view that 'woman becomes she who can unite within her the maternal-feminine and the filial.'

Here I examine these debates to pose another way of approaching posthuman representations of the biotechnological future, drawing on the works of the Australian visual artist Patricia Piccinini to develop my argument. In concluding this chapter and this book, I return to the question of tech- nology and representation to highlight the parallels and differences between the approaches of feminist thinker Donna Haraway and Jean Baudrillard. Through this book, I hope to open up further dialogue between feminist thought and the writings of Baudrillard to better understand the role played by posthuman representations in our perceptions of technology, selfhood and the real. What ensues is a theory of the posthuman that is an amalgam of feminist theory and postmodern image culture. In claiming that posthuman forms like Marilyn Manson and Barbie en- able new form…",

First comes this intense set of statements: There are several consequences to taking seriously the imagery of cyborgs as other than our enemies.

This is another vital strand to her work, but I cannot give it full treatment here, because it takes us too far from the cyborg – though, as I hope to suggest, there’s something ‘cybor- gian’ imprinted in her thinking here, too. The first key concept in this aspect of Haraway’s work is ‘situated knowledges’, which she has worked through in relation to feminist science studies and in relation to teaching women’s studies (Haraway 1992, 1997). It represents her attempt to bridge an impasse in feminist thought between so-called standpoint theory and postmodern or difference feminism, and it centres on the problematic notion of ‘women’s experience’ as an analytical location.

And since time- the disjointure between past and future-is a condition even for the slightest moment, Derrida argues that spectrality is at work in everything that happens.

Barthes’s appropriation of semiotics was concerned with what he called “myth,” or a naturalized form of rhetorical discourse, linking language to ideology. Myth involves a particular use of language in order to establish and con- struct speech (parole), the goal of which is the encoding of a particular kind of meaning.

Rather than become mired in what is seen as the gross giveness of physicality in the feminine - especially with respect to pregnancy and childbirth - it seemed more liberating to claim that women too could transcend their bodies. Even Simone de Beauvoir who took women's bodies seriously enough to devote a major work, The Second Sex, to them was unable or unwilling to reconsider the value split between transcendence and corporeality.

The use of “gender” as a deliberate replacement for sex has a political and historical importance that becomes erased if gender is understood merely as a stand-in for sex. In figuring gender as a form of address, Butler is making gender do something specific that sex had not. The feminist distinction between the two made a point similar to Beauvoir’s by insisting that women are such by virtue of social processes and cultural norms rather than a natural unfolding of a biological process that determines sex.

This is the theory of the perfor- mativity of power, which is par excellence an ontological account of the constitution of bodies. This theory of performativity is conjoined with an account of bodies’ assumption and performance of gender norms. In this view, the body is conceived as capable of acquiring habits through the per- formance of gender norms that are socially, culturally, and historically pro- duced.

OPENINGS Since Malabou’s work has from the start traveled in and through different languages, the volume will open with a contribution by Carolyn Shread, who responds from the position of the translator to the question of philosophy’s negotiation, through attachments and detachments, from its disciplinary others. Shread does so by reflecting on the task of the translator in relation to Malabou’s thought. She brings attention to the peculiarly reflexive task of translating a thinker of plasticity, metamorphosis, and transformation, drawing out some ways that Malabou’s thought can help reconceptualize translation and translation studies. Shread’s piece helpfully moves through various key motifs of Malabou’s thought, situating and introducing Malabou to unfamiliar readers. DETACHING FROM DERRIDA?",

The plasticity then “signifies the disruption and deflagration of presence, the ‘explosive side of subjectivity,’” while functioning as “a structure of transformation and destruction of presence and the present” (2010: 9). In light of this dynamic, Malabou introduces—thus implicitly joining Thom’s view on the non-static perturbative forms— the “metabolic power” of plasticity, that is “its capacity to order transformation” (2010: 21). Questioning her own assertions about plasticity from her earlier work The Future of Hegel (2005), where the word oscillates between two extreme manifestations of form, one crystallizing into a formal whole while the other referring to the power of annihilation and explosion of form, Malabou overcomes such a duality by proposing plasticity as “a wider hermeneutic",

For instance, in Discipline and Punish Foucault focuses on the changes in the way that criminals are punished; he traces the shift from execution to incar- ceration.The genealogical method raises questions about how current practices, in- stitutions, and categories came to be the way they are. It is primarily in his genealogical work that Foucault develops his conception of power.

In what is still the most comprehensive assessment of Agamben’s work to date, Leland de la Durantaye has charted the progression of Agamben’s poetics as it merges with his general comments on the destruction of ex- perience in the modern era (and the accompanying de- subjectifi cation of the subject) and as it is for Agamben an attempt to isolate the “Idea of Lan- guage.”68 What Durantaye refrains from overtly pronouncing, however, is",

Butler sees the body as a schema of sedimented habits, always capable of rematerialization at the face of the law of gender. The psychic is only a second-order expression of the mechanisms of gendering. The law of its materialization is not given to the body from within its psychic interiority; it is received from the cultural world and gives rise to lived experiences of an interiority. Hence, the natural forces, whether they are physical or psychical, do not contribute anything to the body’s becoming. They are simply irrele- vant.

But this path requires an experience reduced precisely to that which, re- garding a thing or a state of aff airs, can satisfy certainty (see below, § 26). Indeed, in its spontaneous course, experience imposes an uncontrolled manifold of intuitions, which never stop developing and varying, so that the contingency of the thing or the state of aff airs aff ects the knowledge, which itself becomes variable, changing, and thus uncertain.

This ‘frenzy of the visible’, to borrow Williams’s term, spatially reconfigures the classic positioning of female body as a passive receptacle – a modern day, capitalist version of Freud’s ‘anatomy is destiny’ – as the face rather than the ovum becomes the repository of sexual expenditure. With the focus on a particular sexual economy invested in capital- ist, Oedipal and gendered flows, that is, on sexual pleasure as caught up ‘in a bound state on the body of capital’ (Deleuze and Guattari",

As Niblett explains, the transition from one phase of accumulation to the next ‘destroys the pre-existing social [and ecological] unities that might have provided the unified referent required by “realist” representation’ (2012, 21). As the lineaments of a familiar reality become destabilised in this way, irrealist representations appear with particular force, captur- ing the ensuing sense of disorientation in figures drawn from folklore, the occult or urban legend. There is clear resonance between this argument and Botting and Edwards’s thesis examined above, in which the authors position globalgothic as a misinterpretation of the local effects of ‘world change’ (2013, 14).

When it returns, it threatens the subject with dissolution, blurring the boundaries which are conventionally and often ritualistically drawn between human and inhuman, clean and defiled. The result may provoke disgust, as well as fascination. Kristeva had turned mostly to Biblical texts and modern literature, Louis-Ferdinand Céline especially, for themes of abjection. But Creed turns to the contemporary popular horror film, which – think of The Exorcist (1973), for example – routinely stages this return as a spectacular event, often literally dissolving the subject’s identity in the process through mutilation, pollution, possession, body-melt, and so on.

It is when pain can be objectified and external- ised through Horror that the damaged body is turned into an available expe- rience to be felt alongside fictional characters.

Some privileged the ethical over the poetical (Levinas, Girard, Kierkegaard); some sought a dialogue between the two (Ricoeur, Patocka); another gave primacy to poetics over ethics (Heidegger). It would appear, at first blush, that Derrida belongs to the third category, developing Heidegger's Destruktion into a thoroughgoing poetics of deconstruction. But appearances are deceptive and I will argue that Derrida's work does manifest concern with ethical issues, particularly in his later writings.

In order to establish this new science of the sign, Kristeva draws heavily on Hegel, Marx and Freud. Linguistic practice, as she sees it, is at once system and transgression (negativity), a product of both the 'drive-governed basis of sound production' and the social space in which the enunciation takes place. Insisting as it does on the heterogeneity of language, semiotics is caught in a paradox: being itself a metalanguage (language which speaks about language) it cannot but homogenize its object in its own discourse. In this sense, then, semiotics is structurally unable to practise what it preaches. For Kristeva, however, the paradoxical nature of the semiotic enterprise does not lead to paralysis but to renewed creativity, since the semiotician caught in this paradox is forced always to analyse her own discursive position, and thus to renew her",

The abject, Kristeva explains, corresponds to the first efforts of the future subject to separate itself from the pre-Oedipal mother. Nausea, distaste and horror are the signs of a radical revulsion, which serves to create a fragile sense of “I” where before there was nothing. Predating repression, which supposes the existence of a constituted subject, there are moves to separate from the mother as matter and materiality. A body must separate from another body in order to be a “proper” self, “one’s own, a…",

In exposing what photography fails to do, Sontag suggests what she would like her writing to accomplish. Sontag clearly wants her writing to give access to what is real, transmit knowledge, and create the conditions for compassionate understanding and ethical action. Indeed, the project of many of Sontag’s best known, early essays is to protect reality from the distorting influence of repre- sentation. She wants her ideas to affect and change minds and culture. So at the end of On Photography, she announces, “If there can be a better way for the real world to include the one of images, it will require an ecology not only of real things but of images as well” (180).

This tension arises first in the field of science and technology studies, signalling that the social constructivist, oppositional approach does not always help to deal with the challenges of a post-anthropocentric or geo-centred shift. In 1985 Donna Haraway, the most prominent contemporary post- anthropocentric thinker, published her path-breaking ‘Manifesto for Cyborgs’, the first posthuman social-theory text of that generation. It guides us into the high-technology world of informatics and telecommu- nications and a post-anthropocentric universe marked by what Haraway (2003) would later define as non-human companion species. Haraway (2006) shows that contemporary technologies are enacting a qualitative shift in our understanding of how the human is constituted in its interaction with non-human others, which requires new politics, ethics and creative new cosmologies.…",

For this book divides psychoanalysis and art into the theoretical and prac- tical components, respectively, of her analysis of the social and symbolic inflexibility of the modern bourgeois world, which is the political problem she addresses there. The division inherits the classical Marxist arrangement of theory (psychoanalysis), the problem (the bourgeois world), and work (artistic practice). The consequence is that her theory of the transformation of meaning and the subject in signs (“revolution in poetic language”) must posit the histori- cal impact of this transformation—social change—but must also leave that his- torical impact in endless abeyance. This is important because the continuities and discontinuities in her thought in the 1970s and the 1980s can be specified in a way that is missing from the literature on her: as a genuine transition resting",

Indeed, as he in some regards replaces it with an emphasis on language, he might appear to be the other half of a psychoanalytic pair, with the desire between body and lan- guage demanding a synthesis of the two. But in fact neither sorts matters out quite so neatly. For Lacan as for Freud, desire arises in an originary experience that is at once lack and separation, absence and the seed of identity.

From the perspective of this inaugural moment of Malabou’s thinking, it should be clear that her later engagements with neuroscience and epigenetics are not and cannot be judged simply to be some variant on the philosophy of biology. Rather, what is at stake is the question of the transformability of and transition between different regimes of form, and with this also a fundamental reworking of the status of philosophical conceptuality as such, and of its rela- tion to the discourse of science in general and of biology in particular. To this extent, her work can also be placed in the context of a long-standing trajectory within the French philosophical tradition, where engagements with biology are central to the fundamental ontological and epistemological commitments of philosophy itself.

When film theorist Laura Mulvey introduced her theory of the male gaze in the 1970s, she emphasized the passivity of the female sitter who is positioned for the scopophilic gaze of the male viewer.23 When bell hooks suggested an oppositional gaze, she called attention to the predominance of images of white women looked at by the viewer of color.24 Yet many aesthetes continue to promote the same gaze that objectifies, sexualizes, and stultifies the female on view.25 Alternative modes of reading have been suggested by feminist theorists over the years that reveal multiple meanings below the sur- face—what philosopher Carolyn Korsmeyer so aptly calls “deep gender.”26 How might we probe for deep gender, and how might we cast the difference between the approaches in perception and interpretation of artworks such as MwangiHutter’s and Manet’s?",

Out of this semiotic (and in continuous relationship with it) arises the symbolic and thus the subject in language. Reference to the semiotic serves multiple purposes for Kristeva. On the one hand it allows her to reﬂect on the question of creativity in language – an issue that we have already encountered in Cavell’s reﬂections on the question of how we can ‘go on’ in language. More importantly, the semiotic sets the stage for a discussion of the bodily nature of language and the gendered nature of subject formation and language acquisition.

In the last two volumes of his History of Sexuality he elaborates an ethical approach that differs radically from most predominant ethical frameworks (Foucault [1984] 1990a, [1984] 1990b). For Foucault, ethics is not primarily about which imperatives we need to follow and how we need to act, but about how human beings constitute themselves as “subjects” of a moral code. And rather than aiming to develop a new code himself, Foucault investigates what these codes “do” to people and how humans “subject” themselves to them. Foucault argues that any moral system or approach consists of three ele- ments: morality encompass not only a moral code people have to comply with",

Indeed, fury is one of the primary modes of antifeminist expression, despite its frequent claim to have moved beyond politics. Attempting to answer that question of motivation—in the stories I tell as well as those I analyze, and the relationship between these—has lead me to integrate questions of affect as central both to how narratives of progress, loss, and return function and as key to effective intervention at the level of a transformative political grammar.∞Ω Affects of despair and hope, resentment and passion form the very currency of Western feminist narratives of progress, loss, and return.

Porn archives, ostensibly authorizing the legitimacy of the study of pornography, may simultaneously undermine the authority of the archive. The contributors to this volume negotiate that tension in differing ways, as have many archi- vists and pornographers before them. In Archive Fever, Derrida pursues a related tension that seems to inhere in the archive. By describing archivization in terms of Freud’s concept of the death drive, Derrida shows how archival power consists in the capacity to de- stroy as well as to preserve. It is not merely that institutions such as libraries are often compelled to deaccess or destroy some of their holdings in order to make room for new ones but, more fundamentally, that the urge to archive necessitates destruction. This argument is especially pertinent to the place of pornography in the archive because porn is routinely deemed more worthy",

By confusing the categories of nature, culture, organism and machine, Haraway challenges the myth of original unity and its intimate associations with the natural. The cyborg ﬁguration thus serves as a subversive and empowering strategy with which to reconsider women’s relationships to each other, technology and notions of the human subject.

The isolation of the sphere of pure Being, which constitutes the fundamental activity of Western metaphysics, is not without analogies with the isolation of bare life in the realm of Western politics. What constitutes man as a thinking animal has its exact counterpart in what constitutes him as a political animal.

You may know without me telling you that ‘‘the past’’ most often refers to the 1970s, that reference to identity and differ- ence denotes the 1980s, and that the 1990s stands as the decade of dif- ference proper, as that which must be returned from in the noughts. The stories part 1 of the book is concerned with tracing are thus ‘‘common sto- ries.’’≥ Implicitly or explicitly too, each decade is understood to house par- ticular schools of thought and particular theorists, irrespective of whether or not their work spans much longer periods. Thus Marxist or radical approaches give way to identity politics, which give way to deconstruc- tivist critiques, which are replaced in turn by (new) materialism. And no doubt we have not seen the last shift. Whether positively or negatively inﬂected, the chronology remains the same, the decades overburdened yet",

And Cixous clearly identifies such similarity in, for instance, Lispector’s passion for questioning. In the following passage, she summarizes her concerns in a study of Lispector’s writing: How do we behave with the other in the major experiences of life-experiences of separation, experiences, in love, of possession and dispossession, of incorporation and non incorporation; experiences of mourning by allusion, of real mourning, all the experiences governed by economies, variable structures?

The work, Benjamin argues, loses the “aura” of sacredness that originally lent itself to religious and exhibition functions, and it is increasingly drawn into a wide range of everyday, political, and social uses. Second, as the functions of these works change, bringing them into greater proximity with a wider range of social activities, so too the mode by which they are perceived and valued by the audience changes. Benjamin argues that rather than sacred awe or absorbed aesthetic contemplation, technically reproducible works – especially those, like film, for which the technology is an intrinsic part of the medium – are perceived in a “mode of distraction,” as backgrounds or elements of other collectively performed activities.

For Levinas, the other has a claim. Although he does not name ethical literary criticism in his theory, the other can possibly be interpreted as the reader or the writer of the text. Amiel-Houser and Mendelson-Maoz’s evaluation of ethical criticism in the twenty- first century refers to Levinas’s criticism of Western philosophy’s “imperialistic proj- ect” (205), characterized by a ferocious search for something that can be identified with the self. Accordingly, empathetic reading is not ideal for ethical criticism. It is a risk to indulge oneself in such a reading for substituting one’s feelings and thoughts for those in a literary text. In that search, one might ignore the differences between oneself and the other and therefore might not fully understand the plight of the other that does not correspond to his own.",

The Party of Pain includes those recovering from surgery or healing from spinal paralysis, for whom pain indicates a restoration of responsiveness; athletes and ascetics who operate on the no-pain, no-gain principle; those eager to prove, test, or martyr themselves; those for whom the material world and the pain experienced in it are mere illusions; and those for whom pain is erotically exciting.

Significantly, the spectre is not straightforwardly an emissary of the past, but also potentially a spirit of the ‘future-to-come’ (19). Thus disordering progressive temporal structures by obscuring the chronology of the past, present and future, the spectre simultaneously disrupts the moment in which it appears, revealing the ‘non-contemporaneity of present time with itself’ (29). In anachronism, the past is revisited upon us: what we thought to be gone returns, confirming its ability to influence the present. At this level, anachronism replicates the ‘de-synchroniz[ing]’ (Derrida 6) manoeuvres of the Freudian uncanny…",

Whereas contemporary readers frequently regard politics as simply an exercise of power over others, the political desire in these black female texts is the acquisition of authority for the self both in the home and in the world. By categorizing these texts as \"female\" I am not referring to the female identity of the author, narrator, or principal character of the work, though female figures predomi- nate in the female text.

These theories reject the separation of desire from pleasure, reinstating the erotic, covetous gaze into the core of beauty. The imaginative viewing position prescribed by the spectator of a painting like Gérôme’s is arguably both masculine and heterosexual.

Second, Agamben’s critical relation to aesthetics is tied directly to his broader investigation into the (today) seemingly self-evident notion of man as an animal whose politics can be managed by considering his material life. Man is, for Agamben, not simply an actual being whose life can be investigated and then charted in order to make correct political decisions (regarding, say, the health of populations). On the contrary, it is through an ongoing production of himself as a speaking, expressing, poetic and creative being that man distinguishes himself from mere life.",

Yet the narratives of the `woman's film', self-consciously addressed as they are to a female audience, must at least claim to place female subjectivity, desire and agency at their centre. The result of this contradiction, which is both internal to the structures of cinema and a function of wider cultural constructions of masculinity and femininity, is an instability and incoherence in the structures of both narrative and looking in the `woman's film'. `Ways of looking', argues Doane, are linked not only to what Laura Mulvey calls `sexual objectification' (Mulvey",

However, throughout the process the arbitrariness of the camera’s unrelated movements continually works to frustrate the viewer’s attempts at constructing (or synthesising from this diversity of ‘views’) a narrative, or a coherent viewpoint or satisfying conceptual overview, or a sense of uniﬁed space (or even a phantasmatic space), by dividing all the possibilities of the visual ﬁeld into a heterogeneous multiplicity",

In any case, it is within the field of phenomenology, in France particularly, that this notion attained the status of a major philosophical concept. In Husserl, Leib refers to the living and sensible body, the body I inhabit, in contrast to the body as a fragment of matter; in short, Leib refers to one’s own body (le corps propre).

To develop this tactile method for reading photography, Barthes relies on the concept of punctum. The punctum is the detail or portion of a photograph that “rises from the scene, shoots out of it like an arrow, and pierces” the viewer (26). The punctum catches the viewer’s attention by accident and “pricks” and “bruises” him or her (43). Barthes’s use of metaphors reveals that the punctum is tactile and induces movement.

When the I awakes in the moment in time it comes to presence through a primordial functioning that fulfills an immediate goal (2008, 61). There is a reflexive presence in the longit- udinal intention through which I come to existence; this presence expli- cates itself through the validation of my voluntary action (2008, 66). In this now I extend myself toward immediate contents that are going to fulfill the horizon of the now (2008, 63) that I retained as what was prompted to me through action—what Husserl called retention.

Unity and wholeness are thus misconceptions of the cogito for Lacan. They are based on a false pretense, since the mirror stage, a stage wherein the perceiving subject misrecognizes himself, is the foundational experience of human consciousness. For Lacan, the cogito is not unified, hence his reworking of Descartes’s “I think therefore I am,” replacing it with: “I am thinking where I am not, therefore I am where I am not thinking” (Lacan 2002: 157).

Scarry argues that one’s own physical pain and the physical pain of others are two wholly distinct orders of events, that our own pain is so unnegotiably present that it may be the primary model of what it means “to have certainty,” while the pain of others is so remote and intangible that it may be the primary model of what it means “to have doubt” (4). While we feel our own pain, we can only hear about the pain of others. Scarry proposes that pain is elusive for nonsufferers because it is actually difficult to represent in lan- guage: “[P]hysical pain—unlike any other state of consciousness—has no ref- erential content. It is not of or for anything. It is precisely because it takes no object that it, more than any other phenomenon, resists objectification in lan- guage” (5).

Here feminist theory finally becomes a mode of being in and for itself, emerging directly from the “situated knowledge” of the hybrid bodies so characteristic of cybernetic societies while, at the same moment, rethinking those hybrids of cyborgs, women, animals, and plants under the sign of social justice. That Haraway actually envisions a radically different way of being scientific–technical, an alternative approach to nature seeking to recapture unrealized, perhaps lost, connections, may be due to the fact that she herself is always already hybrid—part feminist, part cyborg, part compan- ion species. Indeed, there is in all of Haraway’s work a subtle but powerful sign of a nomadic thinker whose intellectual migration",

All three kinds of gaze are predominantly masculine, or associated with the male, something which did not seem to be problematic to Mulvey in 1975. Since then, she has written an afterword which notes this gendering of cinema, but in my opinion she doesn’t get much beyond the idea of a male gaze. A female gaze should, of course, be possible, but it is best to postpone discussion of this to the next chapter. 79 FILM STUDIES",

We might add that in a historical sense every player's actions are a reply to every other player'S actions, insofar as they are aware of them, such that each individual action can only be understood within the context of the unfolding of the game. Having said this, contrary to those structuralists who sought to dissolve the agent within structures, and more in line with Durkheim (1915), who viewed the relation of agent to structure as circular, Merleau-Ponty argues that this structure finds its centre in the human agent. What he means by this is that the structure only exists insofar as agents competently enact it and, indeed, insofar as its principles, the skills its requires and the basic disposition towards enacting it are transmitted across generations.

A general reflection on informatic noise prepares for a substan- tial reading of some seminal work of Michel Serres at the four-way inter- section named in his famous paper with the English title, \"The Origin of Language: Biology, Information Theory, and Thermodynamics.\" Serres puts the concept of noise to work with his signature informatic reading of dialogue, and also with an adaptation of information theory to bio- logical systems theory. I argue that, despite the popularity his approach has enjoyed, it does not actually work with regard to biological systems— which are, in the autopoietic conception, cognitive systems. It is instead, in Serrean parlance, a kind of parasiting of biology by physics, in which a discourse of energy feeds on a discourse of life, instead of the other way around, which would be more ecologically proper.

Roughly, there are two groups of strategies proffered. First, a number of the contributions chart the sometimes destructive effects of the recent theological contamination of philosophy. The task here is simply that of finding a way to perform a philosophical operation upon theological material, while retaining something properly philosophical. Here philosophy turns outwards, both as a critical operation on theology and as a liberation of aspects of religion from their own theological contamination. Second, some of the contributions experiment in the possibility of an aggressive alternative: a complementary philosophical contamination of theology. Experimentation here risks a disintegration of",

But this leaves the subject still in the cycle of appropriating objects to the demand; it leaves him in the chains of metonymy of desire. Instead, Lacan prescribes ‘the freedom to avow one’s desire’, and it is ‘what the subject tolerates least easily’. In refusing to satisfy in the register of demand, the analyst follows through a technique from elsewhere: interpreting resistance, rather than allowing it to perform its reality-giving function. ‘Since no obstacle is put in the way of the subject’s avowal of his desire, it is towards this avowal that he is directed, even shepherded.’ …",

Each chapter oﬀers a theoretical introduction to aspects of Deleuze’s work relevant to horror. Speciﬁc theories do not overlay case studies like mechanistic templates, but seek to bring out a fuller sense of the ﬁlm as an aﬀective aesthetic experience. A multi-layered discussion of the ﬁlmic event is my intention, rather than a ﬂattened, over-schematic and abstract grid. I aim to convey a sense of my own visceral enjoyment of the movies as well as theorising them. Themes are manifest through style, and I will be detailing mise-en-scène and cinematography in each chapter. My analysis will also draw on non-ﬁlm-speciﬁc ideas from elsewhere in Deleuze’s work.

As such, Barad holds that objects do not bring inherent boundaries to their encounters with other objects. Rather, boundaries are produced within the “differential becoming” of intra-acting. On her account, “mat­ ter is produced and productive, generated and generative” (Barad 2007, 137). There is a kind of agency attributed to matter because the constitu­ tion of phenomena that mark the boundaries present in any given context do not rely solely on human agency. Matter itself, as generative, motivates the emergence of properties and boundaries in phenomena, independent of human involvement. Most important here is the idea that “‘things’ do not have determinate boundaries, properties, or meanings apart from their mutual intra-actions” (Barad 2007, 147).",

This is even more clear when Irigaray, in a paradoxical way, refers to women’s divine other as ‘their Other without capital letters’ (Irigaray 1993b: 115). This evocation of a ‘feminine’ divine will thus introduce, instead of the permeable ‘two lips’, more explicit designations of qualities appropriate for women. By way of introducing a ‘feminine’ divine other, Irigaray makes some deliberate definitional moves. She will clarify her use of the terms ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ and their relation to her use of the imagination. The French words le sexe and le genre are extremely problematic to translate. Le sexe has a specific reference not just to biological sexuality but to the male and female sexual organs. Le genre refers to the human race as well as to grammatical gender. Irigaray has thus far",

And his discovery of the objet a as the nodal point of his theory of desire in 1962 leads him to emphasize that this object is precisely what eludes the mirror image.22 The problem with the idea of the mirror stage is that it leads to an emphasis on the imaginary at the expense of the real, which is why Screen theory’s focus on this essay leads to a dead end. But even within the confines of the mirror stage essay itself, Screen theory performs a butchered operation on Lacan’s concept. According to Lacan, the infant between the ages of six and eighteen months has a fragmented experience of its body and has yet to develop an ego. At some point during this period, however, the infant looks in a mirror and sees a whole being instead of a fragmentary one. This deceptio…",

Varadharajan can only dispute the ethereality that ensues from the metropolitan feminist’s avoidance of a political encounter with the feminine Ethnic Other by an overt politicization of subaltern sub- jectivity. The feminine Ethnic Other’s doubtlessly transparent and readily accessible political interests counteract the metropolitan feminist’s disavowal of culpability when the latter reduces subalternity to a theoretical problem par excellence. To resuscitate this abstract subaltern via an infusion of determinate politics, therefore, she cannot grant any substantive basis to Spivak’s concept",

Moving across the work of Malabou, Deleuze, and Spinoza, and concretizing her reflections through an examination of Lars von Trier, Mcnutt explores the interplay of neuroplasticity and affect, chaos, immanence, and composition, exploring how this particular constellation of thought offers new possibilities in the arrangement of self that arises in the convergence of plasticity, affect, and brain as a junction of planes.",

If feminism, as an ensemble of contesting ways of knowing and polit- ical practices, is to continue to develop, it must be self-critical. It needs to understand that a materialist critique of its own historical situation and limits is vital to its ongoing struggle against patriarchy—especially at a time when patriarchy is intensifying both its appropriation of feminism and its backlash against it. The appropriation and backlash are signs that patriarchy is in crisis. It is being divided by its own difference: by the conflict between emergent forms of patriarchy and more traditional modes. In the spaces of these social fissures, contemporary feminism has built the site in which to articu- late social change.

We see the face of a loved one, or a sprig of basil in the market, and we recognize them as such by their color, size, shape, arrangement of features, and so on. Our perceptual system interacts with our memory and other cognitive systems so that we can readily name and understand our per- cepts as being about things in the world. So too with pain, or so we normally think. We feel a twinge in our left shoulder, and we interpret it as indicating damage to our tissues where the pain is felt. In both cases, we perceive sensible qualities that, in collaboration with our cognitive systems, tell us about the state of the world. Our assertion that we see basil there on the display table depends upon our perceiving it as such. But what about the case of pain?",

For over twenty years since its publication, it would appear to have acquired the distinction of having become the most cited work in the history of Film Studies, but to have also had its uses in impassioned debate well beyond Film or Media Studies. The intellectual basis for most feminist antipornography argument, for example, seems to be in Mulvey's article, whether or not its theses were conceived with that application in mind.

While other feminists are concerned that in Foucault and poststructuralism “deconstruction” of identity formations undermines political justification, Butler aims to salvage the possibility of political goals and aims in the context of Foucauldian objects and flows of power. Gender mirrors sex, according to the sex/gender distinction: there is a biological body and the social conditioning of it follows its biological contour. If, for fear of essentialism, gender is theorized using this implicit distinction but proposing gender as radically independent of sex—as in much empiricist-feminism, when one demotes the impor- tance of the biological and promotes constructivism as the whole ac- count—then gender becomes a “free-floating artifice” in which a male body might just as well be described as feminine.",

Against these manifest appearances, I will argue for an understanding of Derrida’s work which connects it powerfully to the very themes which many commentators wish to deny to it, precisely such themes as embodiment, existence, desire, politics or sexuality. As always with Derrida, the consideration of these themes is nuanced and patient in his work, but close reading of his texts demonstrates the significance of this trajectory from his early work onwards. Here, my guiding notion will be a Derridean ‘writing of the body’ (‘l’écriture du corps’, Derrida 1967h: 287) as an exploratory theme for looking at deconstruction. I will trace this conception of a ‘writing of the body’ successively through Derrida’s readings of the work of the avant-garde,…",

As Chapter 2 will demonstrate, Barthes employs intertextual theory to challenge long-held assumptions concerning the role of the author in the production of meaning and the very nature of literary meaning itself. For Barthes, literary meaning can never be fully stabilized by the reader, since the literary work’s intertextual nature always leads readers on to new textual relations. Authors, therefore, cannot be held responsible for the multiple meanings readers can discover within literary texts. Barthes views such a 3 INTRODUCTION",

Popular culture, con­ versely, was rejected as unworthy of analysis because the stories told by advertising, cinema and the then emerging form of television were thought to be constructed with so little precision, and their effects so simple, that any academic attention was undeserving.

Luce Irigaray (1932–) Luce Irigaray is especially critical of Freud’s view of women.In Spéculum de l’autre femme (1974) she argues that Freud’s ‘penis envy’ envisages women as not really existing at all independently but only as negative mirror images of men. Male perception is clearly associated with sight (observation, analysis, aesthetics etc), but women gain pleasure from physical contact.The eroticism of women is fundamentally different to that of men.For Irigaray,all this implies that women should celebrate their completely different nature to men, their otherness. Only in this way can they overcome the traditional male-dominated perception of women. VII.

It also speaks to the harsh reality that a “scream queen” often func- tions as an erotic object to be looked at, not only by the external audience but also by the characters within the film’s narrative (Metz 1975). Due to the voyeuristic pleasure of the cinematic apparatus itself, then, and the duplication of this gaze in the horror film, women watching horror often find themselves bearing witness to their own frailty and inadequacy in the face of sexual assault, suffering, and murder (Williams 1984).

Content, and not meaning, is the equivalent of expression, therefore artists have the right to profess their nihilism in this respect. However, interpretation resists such reductions because it has the means to analyze any given content or lack of it. Sontag reproaches interpretation for not being art, for reducing the work to the content. She implies that when content predominates it is more likely that a uniform view of art will take hold. There is some value in her approach, considering that style is more elusive than content, because content is easier to objectify in formulas. Content can",

For Agamben, creative criticism, combining poetic and philosophical approaches into one discourse, would be the most authentic experience of language.

To summarise: on the account of intentional agency under considera- tion such agency is seen as marked by the availability of reason-giving explanations. To act for a reason, then, is to act to fulfil previously given goals, via a calculus of means and ends. This account sees the rationality of a system as its conformity to objectively specifiable norms of reasoning. The account runs into problems, however, in trying to specify these norms objectively. Any such specification remains indeter- minate until anchored in specific practices, within a context. Moreover any specification implicitly rests on a background of assumptions and know-how which can never be made fully explicit.

In order to conceptualize an alternative to this trap, McGowan—like Žižek, Badiou, and Lee Edelman— privileges the disruptive potential of the death drive (which does not care about objects) over the complacent ways in which desire fixates on and fetishizes objects. Essentially, McGowan suggests that if we could stop desiring objects, we would have no need for capitalism.

If its goal is satisfaction, it can attain satisfaction even from failing to attain this goal. Why is this so? Because, as Lacan suggests, the aim involves not only the attainment of a speciﬁc object, but a particular mode of attainment, an itinerary the drive must undertake in order to access its object or to gain satisfaction from some other object in its place.

While the mirror is no original, the mind is active in its own interpretations, bringing them to pass. The figure makes it paradoxically hard to value the diversity the theory allows, since there is a ‘true’ and a ‘real’ shadowing the scene, albeit negatively. In effect, the mirror is judgemental, as is the rhetoric of the fictional, the imaginary, méconnaissance and trompe l’oeil, competing with a view of the subject which promotes the idiosyncratic scene of identity. The asymptotic metaphor has a similar limit, since it is fated to fall short of a ‘true’, a straight line, a perfection. These metaphors lead into the ‘ontology of lack’ perceived in Lacan and generally criticised.9 Yet, Lacan also conceives of the subject through the metaphor of the sign, in such a w…",

Mulvey’s thesis identiﬁes, as Maggie Humm outlines, the ‘masculinist structures of looking’ (1997: 14) that structure cinema. This thesis suggests a binarist, essentialising (for all genders) approach to image analysis. Mulvey’s theory is now historical however; she offered a productive (in Beller’s sense of spectatorial work), and robust critique to the gender neutral apparatus theories of the previous decade, where ‘the spectator’ ‘can do no other than identify with the camera’ (Metz 1982: 49).

My reading of this letter has involved reading claims to pain as well as sadness and suffering. But what does it mean to be in pain or indeed to have it? It is difﬁcult to talk about the experience of pain. As Elaine Scarry suggests in her powerful book, The Body in Pain, pain is not only a bodily trauma, it also resists or even ‘shatters’ language and communication (Scarry 1985: 5). So that which seems most self-evident – most there, throbbing in its thereness – also slips away, refuses to be simply present in speech, or forms of testimonial address. And yet, as we have seen, ‘claims’ to pain and suf- fering on behalf of myself or others are repeated in forms of speech and writing.

He refers to them as speaking beings with feminine or masculine attributes that are brought forth by language. The symbolic fails to articulate a woman, for she lacks the signifi er there, and is related to the signifi er of the Other’s desire only on the condition that she is castrated in relation to masculine desire. The lack of her own signifi er leaves her outside the symbolic. Since, as Lacan’s diagram of sexu- ation illustrates, she is located on the side of the Other, she appears as an object a, the goddess who is an adjunct to man’s desire.

This is the strain to be elaborated in the novels, as is its antithesis: a set of transcendental possibilities that incorporate entropy into a larger. life-affirming scheme. But already, at the point we have reached in the early stories, the central dichotomy of Pynchon's ethic is emerging: the opposition between those who serve entropy and those who oppose it. As definitive as this distinction would seem to be, it nonetheless blurs in Pynchon's early gnostic matrix, which-as we have seen-tends to sub- vert differentiation. Those who accelerate the drain of energy and those who attempt to stem it both place themselves in opposition to natural process and in alliance with decadent artifice. The perversity of the en- veloping system is such that the means taken to combat negating forces become part of the negative polarity. What we see here is gnostic slippage",

Hence, de Lauretis signals the need for films to represent lesbianism in ways that alter these standard frameworks and recreate the conventions of seeing: Simply casting two women in a standard pornographic scenario or in the stan- dard frame of romance, and repackaging them as a commodity purportedly produced for lesbians, does not seem to me sufficient to disrupt, subvert, or resist the straight representational and social norms by which ‘homosexuality is nothing but heterosexuality’ — nor a fortiori sufficient to shed light on the specific difference that constitutes a lesbian subjectivity.

In describing the action of metaphor, that which like bittersweet itself, brings “two heterogeneous things close to reveal their closeness,”13 Carson enumerates the effects as “triangulates, haunts, splits, wrenches and delights.” Notice two making three. So let us look at the metaphors Carson uses to illuminate the instant of the erotic split. Sweetbitter eros is what hits the raw film of the lover’s mind.

Her recent work, I will argue, departs signiﬁcantly from some of the most important commitments of her early work, and in a direction that disrupts the very experience of the sublime that the early work implicitly celebrated and produced.

Notwithstanding postcolonial feminist disapproval of Spivak’s putative silencing of the subaltern, the essay’s money line (if you will) is the acknowledgment that the “subaltern subject is irretrievably heterogeneous” (284).12 To refute the normalization of silence, Spivak’s titular question lends the lie to any proxy (Vertreten) or portrait (Darstellen) that undertakes verisimilitude. At that time in the Euro-US academy, the aggregate ontol- ogy of the colonized female body stood in stark contrast to the condition of philosophy that proffered an unknowable subject. Against this desire for authenticity, Spivak interjects her notorious lament that “the subaltern cannot speak” (308).13 It may be worthwhile to briefly reread how she got to this statement, especially since “Can the Subaltern Speak?” entered its thirtieth year of publication in 2018.14",

Then you have it and then you don't\" (Cixous 1990, 105). If not seizing, for Cixous, is a crucial requisite for understanding, not giving and not having are equally requisites for loving. \"I accompany the egg to another text, 'Felicidade Clandestina' (Secret Happiness), which I did not want to intro- duce right away. If I do not give it right away, it is out of love. Not to give some- thing right away is perhaps one of the definitions of love\" (Cixous 1990, 11…",

Thus, although feminists object to the way in which women are represen- ted in capitalist society, they nevertheless support it by ratifying one set of representations at the same time as they are trying to dismantle another. Given, therefore, the difficulties of constructing an image of women outside the available discourses, together with feminism's rejection of the way women are represented in those discourses, women must be postulated as an absence - an idea developed by Luce Irigaray, who argues that, because Western discourse has excluded woman, she exists only in terms of an essence which has not yet been recognised. This essence, she continues, is centred on woman's body, which Irigaray discusses as a multiplicity of desires. But this approach, in att…",

This oppression leads to what she calls ‘sex class’. Thus, instead of pointing to the social construction of the family, Firestone points to the bio- logical construction of the family. She says ‘the natural reproductive difference between the sexes led directly to the ﬁrst division of labour at the origins of class, as well as furnishing the paradigm for caste (discrimination based on biological characteristics)’ (9). Sex class set up the con- ditions for all types of oppression. To end their subordination women must seize the means of reproduction.

The aim will eventually become to extract a criterion for aesthetics that can serve as an ethics, based on Bataille’s many fascinating oeuvres as both a creative artist and a rigor- ous scholar. But what again may be particularly novel to the reader is how fruitfully Bataille’s later genealogy of Eroticism of 1957 can frame such of his earlier interventions into aesthetics, across his previous three decades of work – and how Freudo-Nietzsche-Lacanian notions can shine much light on this in a way that even enables Bataille’s own distinct findings to …",

Could we not still at least entertain the possibility that male and female experience in fantasy, for example, might not be so cut and dried in demarcation from each other? The apparent corollary of this—that there is an admixture of qualities deemed masculine within femininity—has already been suggested.

Haraway’s essay argues that the ﬁgure of the cyborg is not a ﬁgure of horror, but a ﬁgure of empowerment. While noting that the means of production of technology is rarely beneﬁcial for women, ultimately she suggests we should celebrate the cyborg because it signiﬁes the breaking down or subversion of dichotomies associ- ated with domination and inequity.30",

The norm serves the role of a biopolitical mask for the conflation of biological life and political life, a mask which conceals the disciplining work of macro-power apparatuses.

      "text": "2 Walter Benjamin and An Working from Benjamin's essay, it can be argued that changes in produc- tion have two results that need to be noted. The first is explicit. The history of technical development provides the framework within which contempo- rary production within the visual arts is to be understood. The second is implicit. Accepting these shifts does not mean abandoning the art of the past. Indeed the contrary is the case; the art of the past is given an after-life by the occasion of its 'now' possible reinterpretation in terms of the changes on a conceptual level demanded by developments on the technical. Art lives on through its reworking. Technical development - as opposed to mere speculative invention - sets the measure. The project of this collection of essays is to use Benjamin's text as a way of opening up questions within the practice of art. The term 'practice of art' is…",

Cinema here corresponds to Krämer’s cartography as a medium ‘test case’ (Krämer 2015: 187–209). His analysis of film (a medium) results in the claim that consciousness is cinematographic. Moreover: cinema is the realization of Husserl’s temporal object that incorporates the tri-partite structure of retention (past), attention (present) and protention (future) in the flux of time (cf. Husserl’s analysis of melody). For Stiegler, Husserl’s temporal object is deemed to show how consciousness works. This is to be evaluated.",

This is no ‘flat ontology’, but rather embedded and embodied material perspectivism at work in addressing real- life issues.

Approaching Abjection In Powers of Horror, Kristeva draws on anthropology and psychoanaly- sis to examine the role of abjection in subject-formation and subjectivity. Abjection, for Kristeva, describes the process by which an infant is able to forge provisional, transitory boundaries between itself and the fig- ure of the Mother. Once these fragile, tentative boundaries are in place, the infant can progress to the mirror-stage of psychic development. Kristeva (1982, p. 13) notes: ‘Even before being like, “I” am not but do",

The small child’s ﬁrst sense of being whole is identiﬁed with the mother counterpart who, as a seemingly whole body, becomes the paradigm for an imaginary unity, applicable to boys and girls alike.25 At the point where Lacan seeks to explain why Freud might have imagined a voracious phallic mother, he encounters Freud’s own inability to see the mother as lacking anything.

But the main point that I wish to make here is the enduring relevance of Mulvey’s paradigms, which now shed light on the sexual objectification of the male body in film.35 The kinds of voyeuristic and fetishistic looking that Mulvey describes in terms of female bodies proves to be newly relevant to both the representation of male bodies in twenty-first-century cinema and the ongoing representation of female bodies.

Much attention has focused on distinguishing between emotion and affect. As Gorton (2007: 334) shows: “some argue that emotion refers to a sociological expression of feelings whereas affect is much more firmly rooted in biology and in our physical response to feelings; others attempt to differentiate on the basis that emotion requires a subject while affect does not.” However, not all feminist theorists see the need for a distinction as Probyn (2005: 11) indicates: “A basic distinc- tion is that emotion refers to cultural and social expression, whereas affects are of a biological and physiologica…",

In the first case, because sound is ‘omni-directional’. There is no ‘point’ of audition in the sense that we speak of a point of view. We find ourselves already immersed in a sonorous field. And for that very reason, sound is passively received, so the border between hearer and the heard, the active and the passive, is fluid and membranous. Audile sensations, finally, offer themselves to us in organizational structures that result from the mixing together and layering of disparate sounds.

The commodity, the reproduc- tion, and the work of art now have a tangled engenrement, which was recognized as least as long ago as Walter Benjamin’s essay ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.’ Benjamin asks whether the aura of the original can be saved from the ubiquitous reproduction of the printing press and the camera. How much more will this be said of the era of the digital reproduc- tion, in which the copy now reproduces itself and spreads as a “virus.” But the ubiquity of digital reproduction not only fails to affirm the aura of the unique existent or art work; it undermines the status of the origi- nal and its claim to the aura of origin, even as it repeats it.

This allows for a residual type of Kantianism to emerge on Foucault’s back, to so speak. It is therefore urgent to assess the state of the theoretical debates on biopower after Foucault, especially in terms of its legal, political, and ethical implications.

To these two terms for life, Agamben adds a third: “bare life”. Agamben adapts this term from Walter Benjamin’s essay, “Critique of Violence”, in which it ﬁ gures as “the bearer of the link between violence and law” (HS, 65). In Agamben’s analysis, bare life forms a couple with sovereignty, whose “fundamental activity” is “the production of bare life” (HS, 181). For Agamben, bare life is “the originary political element” (HS, 90) (see politics). Bare life – “nuda vita”, also translated as “naked life” and “mere life” (ME, 143 n1) – is neither zoe¯ nor bios. Rather, it is life that is produced whenever zoe¯ is separated from bios, and bios (ethical (see ethics) and",

Clay, for example, is plastic because it can receive the form that a sculptor gives to it; the human body is plastic because it can receive the form given to it by a plastic surgeon. Plasticity also names the activity of this sculptor or surgeon, in other words: the giving of the form that the clay or the human body receives. Third, plasticity refers to an explosive substance that evokes the annihilation of all form, something that Malabou has pursued in her works Ontology of the Accident and The New Wounded in which she has discussed personality-destroying neural disorders.41 Now, I would like to suggest that these three dimensions of",

Scarry makes four basic claims about the nature of pain. First, she asserts that it is defined by certitude for the one in pain and by doubt for the one who is not: “For the person whose pain it is, it is ‘effortlessly’ grasped (that is, even with the most heroic effort it cannot not be grasped); while for the perso…",

Overview Throughout this book, I will signal moments when noise contradicts the lit- any Sterne identifies, becoming associated with distance, exteriority, exteriors or surfaces. In the subsequent chapters I show how noise allows us to think the interplay between the senses across new borders, disrupting stable identi- ties and bringing new bodies into relation. This will involve consideration of the issues raised by noise as it operates across the borders of inside and out- side, troubling for example the identity of pleasure and violence. These issues also have a particular valence for thinking national and geographic identities and, as studied here, will be explored with relation to the displacement of logics of filiation through noise and, further beyond this, the relational logic of the nonhuman.

Kristeva’s theorizations of femininity emerge from established philosophical and psychoanalytic figurations of ‘woman’, which portray her as the ‘other’ of masculine subjectivity and the object of its desire. Following Freudian and Lacanian theories of language and the unconscious, Kristeva associates this feminine alterity with a force of potential disruption to symbolic and subjective unity. She posits the “semiotic” as a simultaneous and counter-dependent movement to the symbolic order of language and Law, which plays an equal role in the production of the “subject-in-process” (1984a 25, 40-41). Kristeva defines it as a movement, rhythm or “excess” of the producing system – present in language, and in particular in “poetic” language – which preve…",

Because the abject is “opposed to the I ” it is perceived as a threat that must be “radically excluded” (1–2).

But this influence has been curiously mediated. Until just a few years ago, very little of Derrida's work was available in translation. American philosophers have, with few exceptions, taken little or no interest in Derrida's work, and the whole business of reception, translation, and commentary has been left to the literary critical community. The Yale literary critic Paul de Man has played an essential role in this recep- tion. His seminal 1971 book, Blindness and Insight: Essays in the Rhetoric of Contemporary Criticism, provided one of the first and still most lucid accounts of Derrida's project and, in effect, established the foundations of the enterprise of deconstructive criticism in terms of which Derrida's work continues very",

Go ahead, try to talk about mastery and possession to something that can master and possess us without even attaching any importance to our survival. Now there’s a real “phony war.” What we are fearful of hearing is, as Sloterdijk says, the announce- ment—a terrifying one for those who have always lived under the tension of transcendence—of this “monogeism”: there is no God, there is only one Earth.

In any age, erotic art will be found beneath forms devoted to “higher” kinds of love but above those denounced as crudely “low” and pornographic. Within works devoted to romantic love, artists shun even oblique references to carnal desires so as not to compromise the high style and elevated subject matter. In works considered erotic, on the other hand, artists cultivate a more “middling” style that alludes to sexual objects and desires but stops short of arousing the spectator’s or reader’s sexual feelings. Below this erotic threshold are works whose lurid designs and graphic methods of depiction target both explicit sexual arousal and its gratifi cation.

It is hard not to sense that the ostentatious display in Fatal Attraction of a hysterical career woman and the audience delight in her murder reflects an ineffable feeling of a more deep-rooted hatred. The goal of feminist aesthetics is to appropriate the power, if not the privilege, of such dominant images. Yet feminist film theory, although a sophisticated body of work, often places mainstream cinema in a space of pure difference. Over the past two decades, since Laura Mulvey's germinal vision of Douglas Sirk's films, theorists drawing on psychoanalysis argue that main- stream cinema encourages an inevitably voyeuristic male gaze and 3",

In The Monstrous-Feminine, Creed examines the corpse as abject abomination as it features in films such as The Evil Dead (Dir. Sam Raimi, USA, 1981) and Zombie Flesh Eaters (Dir.

Indeed, one might criticize Irigaray’s account of sexuation as pivoting on stereotypes, deriving from bodily differences distinct forms of masculine and feminine self- affection and differences in how men and women use lan- guage.

Original works now command unparalleled prices, major galleries draw increasingly large attendances even for mediocre exhibitions. At the heart of this lies an astonishing practical reversal of Benjamin's logic.

Neither can occur without the other: if the person does not perceive the distress, neither will he wish it gone; conversely, if he does not wish it gone, he cannot have perceived the pain itself.”16 As a result, language is under an obligation to achieve the impossible: to communicate the incom- municable so as to make it available to amelioration. “The act of verbally ex- pressing pain is a necessary prelude to the collective task of diminishing pain,” Scarry writes; in order to encourage ameliorative intervention, “the human voice must aspire to become a precise reflection of material reality.”17 This",

My partic- ular interest in Kristeva's work, however, lies in its analysis of language as music. She draws a connection between music and the musical, with the rhythms and so- norities of language, in turn, associated with the feminine. Kristeva views music as positioned as language's \"other,\" indeed, as Leslie Dunn puts it, as \"melos vs. lo- gos,\" \"sound vs. sense,\" \"music vs. meaning.\"55 MUSIC AS FEMININE According to Kristeva, the feminine principle, the semiotic, is distinguished from the masculine principle, the symbolic order of representation, language, and social organization. As the negative Other to the symbolic, the semiotic functions, particularly in poetic language, as the transgressor of symbolic order: \"Langua…",

Boys’ bodies too mature at this time, but what their biological devel­ opments entail is a preparedness not simply for reproduction and fatherhood but also for “mature” sexual activity (primarily intercourse).

A tension in Benjamin’s work is manifest therefore between his mes- sianic valorisation of film technology per se and his responses to an auratic cinema that surrounded him. If film destroys ‘aura’ as the very condi- tion of its mechanical reproducibility, Benjamin faces the problem of the sentimental-as-auratic elements that continue to be reproduced within cinema. While Adorno and Horkheimer saw this as reason to condemn the entire medium in the ‘Culture Industry’, Benjamin’s emphasis on film’s potential for progressive perceptual transformation suggests a shift towards questions of self-reflexivity that have been echoed by many more recent theories in film and media studies.

It seems improbable that Sontag wanted to push her argument this far. Such a suspicion is bound to arise, however, from a text that focuses on the impoverishing role of hermeneutics. To focus on style is a universal way of approaching art, but it remains subjective if style is taken to be the medium that isolates and contains. Style must be seen as the immediate totality of both understanding and imagination. If style is something absolutely necessary to art, then it is necessarily subject to evaluation which must be done by interpretation. To admire art at the sensuous level is commendable but insufficient, if art is to be explored further, then meaning is intrinsically attached to it. Sontag writes that a work of art is free to mean nothing. Certainly, aesthetic theory and the",

We could call this quantum measurement without human consciousness. The important point here, though, is that each intra-action or relation contributes to the becoming of the world. But as argued, no object can be reduced to any other object, so even in these relations, a formative and generative gap remains. Knowledge does not close the gap of wonder but may require a reorientation toward a new balance between presence and absence, which in turn motivates activity. Such activity recalibrates agency across a distributed plain. Agency is not merely granted at the “birth” of an object, nor is it something that is consistently manifest throughout the duration of an object. While humans have been said to possess agency, it is something that can fluctuate in levels",

It is based on the view that contemporary feminism is a coalition of various conﬂicting feminisms that are neither co-extensive nor independent, but which act collec- tively to inform contemporary art practices. While a similar case could be made for the processes that have led to the democratisation of sexuality in pornog- raphy and fashion marketing, the current book does not develop this point of view.

Thus, although she rejects écriture féminine, women, for her, still have a privileged access to the semiotic, and are more likely to exploit this in writing. (For a discussion of the problems of a Kristevan position in analysing avant-garde writing, see S.Mills 1989b.)

In many ways, it remains difficult to pin Foucault’s work down into a specific discipline or thematization, and this is perhaps due to the problema- tizations that Foucault concerned himself with, namely how a new “science of man” could lend itself to the governance of life.

Therefore, the process by which violence reconﬁgures space cannot be considered in a unidirectional way.

It is the appearance of the other that calls the subject to a consciousness founded in ethical responsibility. This con- tention is pertinent to the cinema, since the subject–object relation of looking and being looked at are the active–passive mechanisms assumed by almost all theoretical models (especially those of Metz and Mulvey) to underlie spectatorship.

Bare life, in other words, is a metaphysical figure of (a failure of) thought, and not a category of ontic politics. This is to say that no life is bare: that (and indeed despite some of Agamben’s own apparent suggestions to the contrary) no human form-of-life has ever been reduced to bare life. Bare life, like pure being, can never exist (has never existed). But this is not to say that it plays no role in ontic politics.

Derrida’s critics have objected that his concepts of ‘différance’ and ‘undecidability’ undermine the grounds of ethical action and lead to moral relativism. During much of his career, Derrida’s engagement with ethical themes was intermittent and oblique. But in the last two decades of his life, notably in the wake of the Paul de Man controversy, he began to turn more frequently to explicitly ethical as well as political concerns and endeavoured to demonstrate how these were integral to the deconstructive project.

Her study of the signifying practice rests on psychoanalytic theory, drawing a developmental picture of the speaking being, who ﬁrst begins to signify well before she learns words.

Judging from her later publications such as Patterns of Dissonance: A Study of Women and Contemporary Philosophy (1991i), Braidotti was most of all inspired by the oeuvres of Deleuze and Luce Irigaray during the writing of her PhD. So we see that she began very early with the development of her conceptual interest in complexifying the two linguistic communities and scholarly paradigms by investing most of all in a minor tradition of thought that goes against the grain of the classificatory canon by way of setting up a wholly different form of theorizing: a cartographical one.

Paving the way for this critique, Judith Butler had intro- duced ‘performativity’ as a term for describing gender as an ‘enactment’. As she said, ‘Gender ought not to be construed as a stable identity or locus of agency from which various acts follow; rather, gender is an identity tenuously constituted in time, instituted in an exterior space through a stylized repetition of acts’ (Butler 1990: 140). This idea of gender as an unstable identity consti- tuted in exterior space and time develops Foucault’s claim that sexuality is ‘a great surface network’ on the surface of the body, the components of which are linked together by strategies of power and knowledge. Butler went further than Foucault, however, in deconstructing gender and insisting that identity is totally groundless.",

As a process, expelling what is deemed “other” to “oneself,” it is a means for deﬁning the borders of subjectivity. But, as a phenomenon that never entirely recedes, abjection also haunts subjectivity, threatening to unravel what has been constructed; one’s own sense of self is never settled and unshaken. To keep hold of “oneself,” a subject has to remain vigilant against what may undermine its borders. Kristeva argues that much literary creation is a means of this vigi- lance, a kind of catharsis and purging of what is deemed other or abject. But often these literary products show a dark side of humanity, the side that ﬁnds foreigners “uncle…",

The texts gathered are all readings of Clarice Lispector or, rather, readings by Cixous with Lispector in the context of seminars given at the Universite de Paris VIII—Vincennes at Saint Denis and at the College International de Philo- sophic. This in part dictates the format of the texts and an ordering reflective of Cixous's preoccupations rather than one that would follow Lispector's chronol- ogy as a writer. Cixous discovers Lispector at a time when she studies questions of sexual difference in connection with what have been called libidinal econo- mies, that is, with ways the body is engaged in exchanging with and finding its limits in, a social world.",

Donna Haraway’s notion of the cyborg is, in fact, an attempt to rep- resent this mutation of identity, to ﬁgure a new, hybrid, and science- ﬁctional positionality from within a techno-cultural world or space.25 Haraway’s cyborg is not, as is often the case with the more masculinist cyborgs of Hollywood ﬁlms, merely a reproduction of the same old (white male) human subject, whose sense of mastery and autonomy is now protected against incursions by an armored, technological shell or body. For Haraway, the “cyborg subject position” is not stable, but muta- tional; it is not homogeneous or whole, but mixed, hybrid. As such, it necessarily disorganizes the boundaries between “the human” and its others, between a “living” subject and a “dead” technology. The cyborg is",

      "text": "In The Time-Image, Deleuze describes a threefold system for the crystal's variations of past-present-future time. This system is from St Augustine's understanding of temporal relations, and Deleuze utilises it to describe an image's configuration of a memory, or recollection of an event. Together with the Bergsonian concept of time as a 'thought-image', Augustine's system enables Deleuze to discuss the crystal-image as a modality of knowing time and its possible constitution. Over time, the effects of time alter the molecular structure of things (including cinematic information), and the crystal-image is employed by Deleuze to encompass vast shifts in meaning caused through the exchanges between past, present and future images, in their various states of virtual and real. Through these three vari­ ations of the crystal-image, Deleuze describes the cognitive and physical apprehension of time as perceptual 'affectation' and 'modification'.",

They are attempts to “think about, and to confront the difﬁcult thought of, the world-without-us,” which is, in Thacker’s formulation, the world with the human “subtract[ed]” from it. Calling it hostile attempts to comprehend it in human terms as a “world- for us,” while calling it indifferent recognises the “world-in-itself,” some- thing that obtains without reference to us. The world-without-us “lies somewhere in between, in a nebulous zone that is at once impersonal and horriﬁc.”55 Yet we are drawn to it because it tells us something about our own limits as we confront it; supernatural horror enables “the",

Wolfgang Ernst’s translated chapter ‘Kittler-Time’ takes on the risky but highly intriguing task of speculating on how Kittler’s model of (media-)history might provide ‘other possible ways of modelling emphatic time’. Stressing, from the outset, the problems with rushing to historicize Kittler’s model of theorising technology, this chapter in- stead revisits a philosophy of history implicit in Kittler’s writings. Ernst proposes to consider the media-archaeological questions that arise from engaging critically—through Kittler—with the machinations [Machenschaften] of media time. Yet, as he explains, Kittler shows that ‘media archeology cannot be fully merged with the model of history’, an oxymoron that results in an awareness of the ‘different levels and various modes of time-writing’. From Foucault’s film-like ‘discontinu- ous timelessnesses’ of history, to Kittler’s technological a priori of",

It takes it away from the matura- tion process and identiﬁcation (or the process within which the subject is trans- formed through the assimilation of aspects of another) that characterized the trajectory mapped by Klein within which an anxiety concerning the loss of the mother results in introjection of partial objects. Even as mourning and melancholia may ultimately come to form a personality, the structural consequences of loss, which is then most clearly articulated in the Lacanian concept of lack, becomes less important than losses that result from death or the loss of an ideal. It returns us, then, to the question of death and loss through mourning. While Abraham and Torok criticize Klein and others for a misinterpretation of the distinction between incorpo- ration and introjection, it is perhaps more the case that they redeﬁne them, through an",

Apparently, from Calvino's point of view, the reader who forces his or her personal feelings, experiences, and ideologies on a text epitomizes Barthes' understanding of the proper role of readers.

In drawing the mythical figure of the writer from the posthumous condition of writing, Lacoue- Labarthe’s brief declaration indicates instead an obstacle, or at least a fundamental difficulty—that of myth, to which Blanchot was all the more riveted as he sought obstinately to free himself from it.

Butler argues in her book Undoing Gender (2004) that ‘queer theory is understood, by deﬁnition, to oppose all iden- tity claims, including sex assignment’ (7).

Barbara Creed has further argued that the horror genre is a significant “illustration of the work of abjection” for it is filled with images of abject bodily liquids including sweat, vomit, pus, tears, and blood (10), and the genre’s concept of the monster is built around the notion of blurring the boundaries between living/dead, animal/human, good/evil, natural/supernatural, inside/outside the body (10–11).

While the critical practices, epistemologies, and ontologies of feminist theoretical ma- terialism, pointedly, are always bound up with their politics, it is vital not to equate this sociopolitical commitment with identity politics and the poten- tial anthropocentrism of that approach. Instead, for feminist new material- ists, things and ideas jointly produce the world. Epistemology and ontology are inseparable. As Sheldon deftly explicates, “[Feminist] epistemology . . . is not a sieve ﬁltering out the material world and leaving only our relation to ourselves; rather, epistemology directly acts on material liveliness.”33 For feminist new materialists, bodies are not mer…",

The movement-image designates one way of accounting for what occurs in films, and by association, it also accounts for a certain way of understanding the “real world” too. That way of accounting for things is by way of movement. The time-image then provides a different way of accounting for what occurs in films—and in the “real world” too—in terms of time rather than in terms of movement.

It is as if the advent of a corporeal pain evoked the advent of hysteria and even that of a psychosis. In fact, the choice between hysteria and psychosis depends on the way one conceives the fate of the representation of the wounded body. You will recall one of the major hypotheses concerning the genesis of pain: the overinvestment of the mental image of the wounded and painful region of the body. The problem, precisely, is of knowing how long the ego can bear this representation that has become unbearable for it. We had suggested that the representation was excluded from the group of the other representations of the ego; that is to say, it was irreconcilable with the rest of the system. But the question that presents itself concerns its degree of exclusion. Is it excluded while remaining connected to other representations? Or is it excluded to the point of being rejected and",

Thus for Nancy, there is a violence in conceptual (and other) determination that is necessary yet still deeply problematic. Nancyean ontology, I claim, gives us an account of the singular being and of the violence done to the singular through our appropriative acts from which we can begin to articulate an understanding of what is necessarily wrong about state violence. Drawing on Nancy’s ontology, chapter 4 presents my argument for the impossibility of morally justifying state violence. I begin by making plau- sible an addition to our definition of violence: those acts are violent that avoid, repress, or deny the singularity of beings to justify physical acts of violence.

Gender is not innate, we have seen that she argues, but learned and performed; furthermore, the problem with this set- up and the reason we should question the pleasure that the fantasy can provide is that this mode of gender identity falsely masquerades as biologically innate, and cruelly punishes those who won’t abide within its allotted parameters. In other words, if gender is a game, the trouble is that it’s the only game in town. What’s more, it keeps insisting that it’s not just a game but the real thing and that if you don’t play by its rules, then you’re in big trouble, buddy.

Is it in fact life that lives, or do life and the problems associated with it not inevitably raise again the possibility of the divine subject who in the Christian tradition claims to be Life itself?

The relation of Bataille's general economy to postmodern forms of capitalism is explicitly addressed by Jean-Joseph Goux. To what extent, Goux asks, can one continue to consider capitalism as a restricted, utilitar­ ian and morally guided economy, given the spectacular and unprecedented modes of waste, luxury and consumption it creates? Moreover, the very distinctions not only between the sacred and the profane, but also between use and uselessness, necessity and superfluity, the serious and the superfi­ cial have been erased in postwar society.

Molnar would also not disagree with Harman’s argument that an object’s properties are always fully actual and intrinsic (rather than potential or virtual), even when they are not currently being enacted (Harman 2009b, 130).

On Foucault’s account, in dispensing with the notion of a human telos and thus a notion of the good life, the politics of modernity concerns itself only with bare life. For millennia, man remained what he was for Aristotle: a living animal with the additional capacity for a political existence; modern man is an animal whose politics places his existence as a living being in question. (Foucault 1984: p. 265) The subject of power is now bare life. The similarity between Agamben and MacIntyre is then striking, but it stops here. The relationship between Agamben and Foucault is closer and explicit, though it differs in important respects. Agamben seeks to interrogate the link between bare life and politics. Such an interrogation, he claims, ‘will be able to bring the political out of its concealment and, at the same time, return thought to its practical c…",

For Benjamin, with the advent of such innovations as photography and particularly ﬁ lm, art becomes formally embedded in social practice and poli- tics: he argues ‘when the age of mechanical reproduction separated art from its basis in cult, the semblance of its autonomy disappeared forever’ (220). What emerges as a result of mechanical reproduction is an equality of access to art and the exposure of previously unseen parts of the world. Citing par- ticularly the use of the close-up, ‘focusing on hidden details of familiar objects’ (229), and slow motion in which ‘movement is extended’ (230), Benjamin argues that the ‘dynamite of the tenth of a second’ of the ﬁ lm frame radically restructures the world.

(Nora 2002) Butler ‘‘pushes’’ feminist thought forward, ‘‘refuses’’ to get caught in the traps of a focus on ‘‘women’’ that mark earlier periods of feminist theoriz- ing and politics, rejects an essentialist view of the body or the social as outside discourse, and carries academic feminism into a new era. Because of Butler, feminist theory now has the epistemological and methodological tools to deconstruct or ‘‘revise’’ previous understandings of ‘‘power, poli- tics, and subjective agency’’ and to take its own history as object of inquiry. In such accounts, Butler is positioned as critiquing both the ‘‘foundational",

She therefore regards sexual difference as more fundamental than other dif- ferences, such as race. She also asserts that all individuals are naturally either male or female, implicitly denying – or dismissing as aberrant – the intersexed (those whose bodies have ambiguous sex characteristics, such as testes and a vagina).

This sense of hauntedness sees time as anachronistic instead of linear, as something which is constantly folding in on itself as the spectre brings about a ‘disadjustment of the contemporary’ (Derrida 2006, 123). In this sense, the overlapping and folded nature of time implies that trace elements of the past can be identified at different points across history, at different points in the present moment.

They are not in competition with each other but suggest that there are two ways in which the rapid diminution of grief may seem problematic: It could be evidence of both blindness and callousness. Indeed, it seems to me that one would lead to the other. Both are failures of love. I hasten to add a clariﬁcation: Of course, we do not anticipate every change in feeling, even every reasonable feeling, with horror. For example, I once ruined my favorite shirt. However, I realized that, very soon, I would have a new favorite, and, in anticipating this change, I did not despair over becoming a different person. In my experience, there was no Proustian moment. This is because I did not identify with my",

The artwork is something we experience intimately, yet it is alien and other; it is immediately accessible yet it poses a challenge of comprehension and interpretation; the works are artificial yet the illusions they offer tend to efface their created charac­ ter. These tensions give the work its charge and it is this power that can be used in political aesthetic interventions to lay what Benjamin thinks of as cultural depth charges with powers to illuminate the present and show us different ways forward. In Benjamin's thought, the notion of a critically charged excess placed into the field of popular culture is associated with the concept of a 'dialectical image'. In such images we find the interplay of alternate temporalities, including disjunctures, eruptions and breaks, in which mundane reality can become",

Expressed as eternal return, the recurrent possibility in each moment of time for the emergence of the new and unforeseen, the appearance of direct time- images is unpredictable in advance. If the time-image occurs or recurs in the form of eternal recurrence, as soon as the cinema becomes pos- sible, the direct time-image subsists within the logic of cinema as a pure virtuality, and this virtuality is not historical because it is unencumbered by the empirical or chronological forms of time. Several conclusions may be drawn here. The transition from the movement-image to the time-image is neither complete nor distinct, and indeed even “primitive” time-images persist and insist from the very beginnings of cinema.

These responses to The Little Foxes and One Two Two occur long before Barthes has begun to write Camera Lucida, and it seems to me that the diary’s accounts of the ‘resurrections of the mother’ in films leave their mark firmly and precisely upon the descriptions of the punctum that appear in the ‘Photo- Maman book’ – the book with which Barthes is struggling while he is moved by what he sees upon the screen.22 What is revealed, then, by the publication of the Mourning Diary in 2009 – and in a manner more textually, linguistically exact than in ‘The Third Meaning’ – is that the punctum saliens of the punctum lies in film, not in photography.

Beginning from a reﬂ ection on the main argument of Archive Fever concerning the nature of the psychoana- lytic archive, I will argue that the texts of Freud and Derrida, read together, ultimately enable a rethinking of the very nature of history around the possibility of its erasure. Moving beyond what Derrida explicitly suggests, I will also argue that these insights about history can ultimately be under- stood only from within the literary story of Norbert Hanold, the archaeolo- gist, and in particular, the story of his dream.

Freud represents “feminine” sexuality in terms of its resemblance and analogy with the identity of the phallus and “masculine” sexuality: the clitoris is like a penis, the little girl’s stimulation of her clitoris is like the little boy’s stimulation of his penis, and in this sense, the little girl is like a little boy.

Such a hauntology posits the desire of needs as central in human experience, which perpetually accentu­ ates the groundlessness of the present.

The validation of the desired objects is sought in the past, as memory and history, which sets spectrality in motion. Even negated meaning and actions not taken may return as haunting ghosts, or even more clearly put, these are proba­ bly the most common and strongest haunting forces.

While indeed some objects might inﬂuence the collectives to which they belong to a greater extent than others, it doesn’t follow from this that these objects are more real than others.

History has become natural, fixed in the physical decay of the ruin, and yet the eternal transience (and thus meaninglessness) of nature is also revealed to be the essence of what history now is. The most cited essay by Benjamin comes from his Marxist period: 'The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction' (1970b). This essay is an analysis of the impact that photography and cinema have upon the consumption of art, not least in so far as the reproduci- bility of the photograph undermines traditional ideas of the originality or authenticity of the work (and thus its 'aura'), and allows mass distri- bution and possession of the art work. As such it provides a series of provocative insights into the nature of photography and cinema, such as his comparison of film to psychoanalysis (whereby both bring to consciousness that which would otherwise pass as insignificant…",

She considered Lacan’s ‘symbolic’ stage in a child’s development to be the main root of male dominance. When a child learns language, it also recog- nises principles of order, law and rationality associated with a patriarchal society. Lacan’s pre-Oedipal ‘imaginary’ stage is referred to by Kristeva as ‘semiotic’, and literature, especially poetry, can tap the rhythms and drives of this stage.The pre-Oedipal stage is also associated very closely with the body of the mother.When the male child enters the ‘symbolic’ order, however, the child identiﬁes with the father.

In her essay “Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic and Power,” which has reached near-creedal status among contemporary liberal theologians commenting on this issue, Lorde defined eros principally as a “creative energy” and “lifeforce” that has the capacity for “providing the power which comes from sharing deeply any pursuit with another person. The sharing of joy, whether physical, emotional, psychic, or intellectual, forms a bridge between the sharers.”15 It may entail sexual or nonsexual sharing; it may be solitary.

In this respect, the biologisation of reason might be seen as a successful strategy of resistance to biopolitical power. Both Foucault and Deleuze argued that when biopo- litical power takes life as its object, it is the vital power of life that allows us to resist power. In a similar vein, Malabou argues that recent developments in biology, such as epigenetics, cloning or gene editing, demonstrate that the biological dimension of our lives should be understood not as determina- tion but as a potential for freedom and change.

Indeed, she endorses the project of thinking materiality in terms of différance or the trace, that is, in terms of forms of nonidentity that would require us to rethink ontological categories of substance and bodies. Plasticity is, for Malabou, the thought of the nongraphic trace, allowing us to think materiality in way that is constrained by neither the formal properties peculiar to signifying elements nor to what Derrida called forms of presence. Heir to the deconstructive notion of writing, but capable of thematizing what writing has so far obscured, plasticity names the possibility of morphogenesis—the original modifiability of matter. Malabou proposes plasticity as a motor scheme that makes explicit what is implicit in the empirical image of neuronal plasticity, the intrinsic power of matter to take on, lose, and give itself form.",

Invoking the rhetoric of reproduction, the poem describes the speaker's love as the product of a union between de­ spair and impossibility. This rare birth is not a consummation; despair's embrace of impossibility does not yield an assured future. And yet, the poem insists that such a rare birth is preferable-stranger, higher-than a love born out of hopefulness. In this sense, intimate experience in the novel offers a model for an alternative form of political feeling, a non­ utopian expectancy: a kind of hope without reason, without expectation of success.19 Such a form of political affect may be the kind of feeling we need to learn how to use in contemporary politics, when hope in its old idealizing and utopian form-of optimism-seems to have lost its hold on many of us.

The Movement-Image Beginning with the basic structure of the movement-image, Deleuze breaks it into three types of image: the perception-image, the action-image, and the affection-image.10 Because any space in the movement-image is homogeneous with any other, insofar as they are any-space-whatevers, the film can be played forward as well as backward without a …",

In this work he starts with a thorough critique of structuralist attempts to trace common basic structures in all stories. He is more interested in what makes them different than what they have common. Every text refers back, in different ways, to all other texts that have ever been written. For Barthes, there are two types of text: that which allows the reader only to comprehend in a prede- termined way and that which makes the reader into the producer of his or her own meaning.The ﬁrst type of text he calls ‘readerly’ (lisible) and the other ‘writerly’ (scriptible).

It per- forms the impossibility of such articulation of difference within the dis- cursive system that has produced it as abject. The question of articulating difference in language is posed as a question of the very possibilities and impossibilities of intelligibility itself. Thus, this thinking of difference is committed, and gives rise, to a different thinking. Irigaray’s challenge to the phallogocentric economy and its constitutive suppression of the femi- nine is particularly suggestive in that respect. Irigaray’s non-phallic meta- phor of the lips—neither singular nor plural—gestures toward what Tina Chanter calls an “ethics of eros,” an ethical space where sexual difference is reclaimed and reﬁ gured beyond the Platonic economy of the same. 3",

To make sense of the current condition of global violence and to the mechanisms of horror this condition enables, we agree with proponents of a biopolitical sovereignty approach that several insights from both Schmitt and Foucault can be retrieved. But, unlike what some biopolitical sovereignty scholars do, we do not believe that both systems of thought about sovereignty and power should be fused so as to arrive at a satisfactory or even comprehensive explanatory model.

Psychoanalysis, by contrast, focuses on ‘the psychosocial signiﬁcation and lived reality of sexed bodies’ rather than on merely ‘abstract’ conceptions of masculinity and femininity (pp. 299–300). Thus, psychoanalytic theory encourages us to explore the ways in which subjects are constructed as bodies in relation to speciﬁc sociosexual circumstances. Grosz is especially concerned with the processes through which cultural anxieties come to be inscribed on the body, particularly the female one.

It can become implicated in mass movements such as fascism, which for Benjamin constitutes the politicization of aesthetics, or it can lead to the emancipation of artworks from ‘dependence on ritual’. Either way, art is now unmistakably in the political domain as far as Benjamin is concerned.

Elsewhere, for example, he insists that the task of definitively isolating any unit or identity is an impossible one: The linguistic mechanism is geared to differences and identities, the former being only the counterpart of the latter.

Feminist and cultural theorists have made significant interventions into theorising emotions and intimacy, which is captured to some extent in the con- cept of the “turn to affect”. The theoretical debates extend beyond the issue of intimacy and love. The breadth of theoretical engagement from feminists regarding emotions and affect is part of what is described as the “emotionalisa- tion of society” and the intensification of interest in emotions and affect as the subject of scholarly research. The shift is part of an emphasis on the emotional and subjective. I consider the contribution of a wide range of feminist theorists of affect and emotion in Chapter 6 which also focuses on the transnational and cross-cultural application of such theorising.

However, abjection by its very nature is ambiguous; it both repels and attracts, undermining borders and unsettling identity. Separating out the mother and her universe from the symbolic order is not an easy task –​ perhaps it is, finally, not even possible. Furthermore, when we begin to examine closely the nature of the monstrous mother we discover she also has a crucial role to play in relation to castration and the child’s passage into the symbolic order –​ issues discussed in Part II in relation to the images of the vagina dentata and the castrating mother.",

Human life is thereby included in the juridical order as exception, as that which is exposed to the immediate exercise of power, to the point of death. As this order becomes a global reality, so new forms of political thought and action are required and are in fact emerging.

Atoms are only found by subjects that are constituted by the specific material practices currently ongoing. Both atoms and individuals emerge from such intra-action. Further, matter is not merely passive stuff, waiting for an active, self-moving agent, such as the rational human being, to move inert objects. In Barad’s agential-realism, matter and objects have the same motivating capacities of movement as humans do. Thus, agential-­ realism also radically challenges traditional notions of causality.

It is Breillat’s engagement with pornogra- phy and the conventions of pornographic sound that we must contextualise next before analysing her own sonic exploration of the female body. Breillat’s little noises helps us to think about the resonant body as an intimate relation between bodies, a responsiveness that cinema makes possible to expressions that evade capture and exist at the limits of their own disclosure.

Ahmed shows us how shades of strength in the formations of sharing an object of happiness, and having a fellow feeling for someone who has that object, can be identiﬁed as modes of distribution of power in ‘the moral economy of happiness’ in that domestic scene.8 Ahmed draws on both her personal experience and literary research to examine how it is that happiness operates to structure hierarchy in the family. She describes the awkward feeling as a daughter at the dining table in her own ‘conventional family’. This, is in her case, not just because of disappointment over the banality of the reality of happiness – where, like a bride might feel on her wedding day, ‘We cannot always close the gap between how we feel and how we think we should feel. To feel the gap might be to feel a sense of disappointment.’9 Ahmed as a feminist cannot and will not concur and comply with the",

Ghosts are never quite avowed nor ever fully relinquished, they are both present and absent; they are the trace of something dead but which in some sense lives on. The ﬁnal chapter concludes by examining how the personiﬁcation of theory and the announcement of its death enable it to survive and to return in just such a ghostly manner. Its presence may be denied, its nature may be transformed, but it has not quite gone away. Its death is not its end, it is merely a prelude to its afterlife.8 As its title implies, this book is about aspects of being ‘after post- structuralism’. One sense of this involves going after poststructuralism as hunters goes after their prey, to catch it and to catch it out.

Unlike in Bürger, in Benjamin the way in which the audience perceives works of art has socially and politically transformative potential in and of itself. In “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” Benjamin explains that photography, lithography, and film destroy the uniqueness and authenticity inherent in the notion of tradition—especially tradition in art—through their nearly unlimited capacity for reproduction (1968b: 218-20). He argues that mechanical reproducibility brings about the demise of art’s aura by detaching the object “from the domain of tradition” (1968b: 221). Mechanical reproduction rivals the creativity of humankind and dispels the magical aura that originality, as well as the sacred and ritual quality surrounding the creative act (at times associated with divine inspiration), would ascribe to all artistic endeavor.

But what all of these different versions have in common is a very basic faith in the sustaining, transformative, and unifying power of technology. Furthermore-even when we are told that we are technol- ogy-technology itself is still treated as a distinct and powerful other.

On the side of interpretation of these procedures, Benjamin argues, this essential incompleteness is viewed by the artwork’s producer as an occasion of melancholy, which burgeons into a representation of history as a process of decline.

The demand for self-sacriﬁce has been a masculine ideal, but a peculiarly feminine practice.8 So in that sense Cixous’ love, while clearly understandable as other-regarding, is strictly speaking not agapic, for Cixous is typically no advocate of sacriﬁcial logic.9 Furthermore, the challenges that the concept of agape faced in the twentieth century have turned out to be almost insurmountable even within the province",

This is still highly important, to be sure; but, as they emphasize, today they are also committing themselves more and more to alternative—reconstructive—technoscience projects, that is, to projects that represent a new way of doing science, one informed by feminist critiques and epistemologies. It is to be hoped that the “bits of life” ﬁgure, precisely because of its strengthening of the focus on provisional cuts and its relentless openness to new becomings, may be helpful in this process. 14 I NINA LYKKE",

Derrida proposes that the history of the twentieth century can best be thought through its relation to the “archive,” a psychic as well as technical procedure of recording or of “writing” history that participates not only in its remembering but also in its forgetting. At the heart of psychoanalysis, Derrida suggests, is the thinking of an archival drive that si…",

Since the acceptance of human dissection in Western culture, autopsy has aimed at the correla- tion of lesions in the cadaver with symptoms in the live patient, the cate- gorization of disease, and the development of treatments for the future. At this particular moment, we’re trying to catch up to AIDS, not to men- tion cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and many more ailments. That the body must have this performative function of its own—this doing in the world—is supported by the obvious point that illnesses not yet present- ing themselves are of no concern. Of course, one could protest that diseases like AIDS, cancer, and perhaps even diabetes and Alzheimer’s culturally construct the lived body by virtue of lifestyle effects, a sort of perlocutionary force of social imper- atives.

As we will see speciﬁcally in Chapter 5, and passim in Chapters 3 and 4, for Cixous an other- love that is other-regarding is also a feminine love. Moreover, in a feminine relation to the other lies the possibility of divinity; something she has often described as a ‘second innocence’. Her conception of a feminine economy of desire that is the basis of this other-regarding love is grounded not in the tele- ology of an other who is other-for-me, but rather in an other who is beyond and elsewhere to me, an other whose difference calls me/us into becoming.

As Sontag writes, through the framework of war images, her photographic aesthetic of death reflects just an introduction to culture’s impact of the insanity of war when reporting the horrors of the battlefield.

From the perspective of postmodem anarchism, of course, the latter reading is far more interesting. Indeed, the most radical analysis in Discipline and Punish has little to do with incarceration at all. Foucault' s investigation into the origins of the prison permits him to extend his genealogical analysis to a much broader social phenomenon, which he calls discipline.

Plasticity refers to the qualitative change that takes place both at the level of cells (cell plasticity) and the brain (neuroplasticity), and that can be either creative or destructive.

Despite the empathic way in which it treats this topic and the identification that is encouraged with Lee in her suffering as well as in her desire, Shainberg’s film continues to portray self-injury in the context of mental illness and recovery. The final section of this chapter will explore the ideas raised by a much more experimental depiction of ‘cutting’, that found in de Van’s film In My Skin. De Van’s film employs an avant-garde aesthetic that is appropriately challenging and demands an active and committed viewing position from the spectator, disrupting spectatorial pleasure and conventional suturing techniques just as the self-mutilated body disturbs societal expectations and notions of beauty.

It was these patterns that Mulvey's essay attempted to analyse—and, in analysing, to destroy. Mulvey's theory of the ‘male gaze’ came in for intense criticism, both by feminists working within a Marxian/psychoanalytic paradigm and by those working outside it. Even feminist film theorists sympathetic to Mulvey's basic approach, such as E. Ann Kaplan, called her to task for oversimplifying the experience of the female spectator. For Mulvey, the female film-goer either identified with the male protagonist or enjoyed the masochistic pleasure of her own objectification (Kaplan 1987: 231).

INTRODUCTION TO MALABOU CHAPTERS Chapters 1 through 3 are written by Catherine Malabou; originally pre- pared as lectures, they off er multiple perspectives on the relationship of plasticity to politics and law. In “Will Sovereignty Ever Be Decon- structed?,” Malabou asks whether the critique of sovereignty begun by Foucault, Agamben, and Derrida might unwittingly have resuscitated sovereignty instead. Her argument focuses on the symbolic potential of biology, which theories of biopolitics have relegated to a po liti cal veil for sovereign power. What would happen, Malabou inquires, if we read the biological not just as a concealment for the normative basis of bio- power but as its own plastic symbolic system? Might we then, fi nally, be in a position to orient our po liti cal theories beyond any vestiges of sovereignty?",

Giorgio Agamben (b. 1942) works on Biblical textual criticism, medieval literature, holocaust literature, poetics, aesthetics, and political philosophy. The spectrum of his writing extends from the philosophy of language and literature, in works such as Stanzas: Word and Phantasm in Western Culture (1977) and The Idea of Prose (1985), to biopolitics, in books including Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (1995) and State of Exception (2005). But the two subject areas are not separate; it is not as if Agamben were moving from one specialism to another. Rather, both language and biopolitics are confronted by him as regions in which operations of inclusion and exclusion are at work, and it is the presuppositions which allow these operations to function that he seeks to dra…",

As already indicated, Creed transposes Kristeva’s psychoanalytic notion of the abject as that ‘which signifies the place where meaning collapses, the place where “I” am not’ (1993: 8), to themes and images in the horror genre. The abject is related to any notion of an ambiguous border: between the inside and the outside of the body, such as blood, wounds, vomit and excrement; between mother and child; between human and non-­human; and ultimately between life and death.

It has many consequences we cannot go into here, but the bottom line is that it perhaps represents an attack on Lacan’s conceptions of language and desire (‘desire is the desire of the Other’). It seems that later Deleuze still insists on one of its aspects: People’s dreams are always all-consuming and threaten to devour us. What other people dream is very dangerous. Dreams are terrifying will to power.",

She goes on to suggest the ways in which film manages these pleasures with a gendered imbalance, so that men are associated with activity and women with passivity. ‘In their traditional exhibitionist role women are looked at and displayed’ for the audience and for the pleasure of the main male characters in the film (with whom the audience identifies).

As we have discussed briefly, Irigaray herself is somewhat open to the charge of an ahistorical essentialism in her concentra­ tion on the female, and particularly maternal, body, but for other theorists such as Butler or Liz Grosz the commitment to feminism is fully consonant with an analysis that lends itself to a fuller understanding of corporeality in whatever form it might take.

It also invites us to investigate the possibilities of a plurality of masculinities and femininities, of a range of ways of living our lives. In so far as this tends towards an implosion of gender as a useful category of analysis, disentangling sex, gender and desire, queer theory also encourages us to focus on the utopia of a gender-free world.

In taking ambiguity as the focus of my analysis of art practices, I have suggested that contemporary feminist art that critically re-visioned the female nude, or referred critically to the female body in representation, proceeded in this way on the basis of a conceptual ideal. In producing such art, artists navi- gated ambiguities according to the positive value of visual, erotic appeal, and to the ethical principle of inclusiveness. Such ‘metaphysical’ assumptions have been crucial, although perhaps not necessary, to the way feminism has informed critical and artistic practices, and, more generally, to the way it has been enacted as an emancipatory, political project. In making these claims, my analysis is conducted from a general theoretical framework. Since anti-humanist critics dismiss some feminisms on account of their ‘regressive’ idealism, I want to",

Lorde’s “Uses of the Erotic” is a massive and com- munal theoretical dialogue that reimagines the erotic away from Western designs, spiritually reaffirming it for women and people of color especially. Although Lorde did not originate the term or theories of the erotic, her reimagining of them has been a central focal point for feminist studies and African American studies. For those of us who study black genders and sexualities, “Uses of the Erotic” is an introductory document that induces paralysis with the enormity of its expecta- tions and goals and inspires awe with its discursive touch to symbolize the very thing that it speaks about: the erotic. It is a beautiful and delicious essay and tastes, for lack of a better parallel, like a lover well on the way to a climax.

Feminist Phenomenology While there is more than one phenomenological method, feminist phenom- enology emphasizes the importance of the experience of the situated, embod- ied subject. Feminist phenomenologists are especially concerned with the historically ignored, gendered aspects of experience. Beginning with the revo- lutionary work of Simone de Beauvoir, feminist phenomenology has success- fully navigated the realms of theory and praxis, the personal and philosophi- cal.

In the writings of Pompeius Festus, a grammarian and etymologist of the second century ad, the homo sacer is defined as the one whom the people have judged on account of a crime. It is not permitted to sacrifice this man, yet he who kills him will not be condemned for homicide; in the first tribunitian law, in fact, it is noted that ‘if someone kills the one who is sacred according to the plebiscite, it will not be considered homicide’. This is why it is customary for a bad or impure man to be called sacred.10 The use of the word ‘sacred’ in the context of purity and impurity requires contextualization. In its original meaning, ‘sacred’ denotes in fact that which is set aside or reserved for use in relation to worship. Such an action, however, exposes the sacred object to interpretation through the categories of cleanness",

I am not using this word in a pejorative sense, but to indicate the extremely intricate and interconnected, as well as divergent and impassable, strategies that are involved. In part, this is due to the lack of precision in Levinas’s work of the notions of ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ – is he referring to actual women, to simply ‘feminine’ attributes, or to both at once? Irigaray, who will not agree with Levinas, has her own complex ideas on the interaction of sex and gender, on the ‘feminine’ and on relationships between men and women.

If life is defined by a duplicity ­– the distinction between the living being and life ‘itself’ – then, according to Thacker’s historical survey of the ‘teratological noosphere’, in the undertow of the questioning of life we always find changing conceptualizations of afterlife, whose horrific avatars are so many embodiments (or disembodi­ ments) of this problematic duplicity.

By contrast, if the representational struc- ture of pornography is not based on identifi cation, but on a more detached form of viewing (Allen, Projecting Illusion , 130–1), this poses the question as to what extent both female and male characters in porn function as “objects- to- be- looked- at” for both male and female spectators. Furthermore, as Gertrud Koch and many others have noted, the “carnal pleasure of looking” at erotic action is not only a common pleasure among men, but also for many women, not necessarily identifying with …",

      "text": "all. There is, in Cixous's reading of Lispector's absolute, an ever so slight slip- page that glides toward a separation of the ordinary from the extraordinary, there where Lispector insists on the extraordinary in the ordinary. Like many of her French contemporaries, Cixous distinguishes between an ar- tistic \"avant-garde\" and the masses, between the extraordinary and the banal, between the poetic and everyday language. She expresses a slight contempt for the latter, and with it comes an implicit reconstruction of power. The attitude is one that may indeed give pause. On the contrary, Lispector's existential writings privilege a calm, often mock-heroic disposition in a brutally common condition of everyday life that—disaffected from its phallic system of value and evincing a great deal of humor, even joy —seems to underline the extraordinary in the very wealth of the ordinary. There is a strange tension between Cixous's ongoing",

      "text": "Accordingly, Agamben notes that the Greeks originally used two words for life: zoe and bios. Zoe denotes just life in general or bare life, as Agamben comes to call it; bios, on the other hand, is a particular kind of life, perfected individually by virtue and socially by politics. The entire Western tradition of politics which has incorporated bare life into the city through individual or political virtue has, Agamben argues, achieved this inclusion paradoxically through an act of exclusion. Bare life, or zoe, is included or co-opted into the political domain because of its potential to supply the raw lifeline of a particular bios, but excluded by the same token because it does not remain itself.9 The importance of this initially linguistic distinction of zoe and bios does not appear clear until we consider the second adumbration of biopolitics which Agamben detects in classical culture: the figure of the homo sacer.

(1994b, 76) Not only does Grosz establish a rationale for the move from psychoan- alytic lack to Deleuzian production, but it is also possible to detect the move towards affect in her use of Deleuze. Her attention to desire as a movement, to something that causes bodies to move or ‘to do’, sets the scene for later work that concentrates more specifically on this move- ment, this becoming. Elspeth Probyn, for example, draws on Grosz’s work to think more specifically about what desire does, how desire ‘moves us at different times and in different ways to engage’ (1996, 151). In her figuration of ‘becoming-horse’, for instance, she considers desire as movement in an attempt to construct a queer use of desire. Instead of conceiving desire as pointing towards one object (person, place or thing), and therefore falling into the negative polemics of lack, Probyn wants to consider the movement inherent to desire. Like Grosz, she turns to Deleuze, more",

      "text": "AA Key WOEAS SUMMARY In her celebrated essay ‘Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema’, Mulvey proposes that narrative cinema produces the male as agent of the look and the female as the object of spectacle through mechanisms of voyeurism and fetishism. In this way, narrative cinema imposes ‘masculine’ viewing strategies on all of its spectators, irrespective of their actual sex. Her argu- ment gave rise to a number of debates, particularly as to whether narrative cinema systematically excludes women and the ‘female gaze’. To answer these questions, feminist theorists investigated films targeted at female viewers as well as studying the actual reception of films by female audi- ences. Mulvey herself modified her arguments in her ‘Afterthoughts’ to her essay, where she considers the role of the female spectator. She argues that, in accepting the ‘masculinized’ subject position …",

As I show here, in the case of Breillat, little noises and an appeal to the unlistenable encourage a new modality of listening. According to musicologist Michael C. Heller ‘Loudness remains among the least analysed components of sonic encounter’ (2015: 42). Yet, ‘loudness –­ a fundamental parameter of sound itself –­ exists as a continuum bounded on either side by silence and pain’ (42). Thinking about noise and volume –­ noises at extreme limits of audibility –­ reflect crucially on Breillat’s wider exploration of female desire and subjectivity as well as opening new avenues for thinking about her engage- ment with questions concerning intimacy, exposure and the real.

To garner actual avenues for subaltern women to speak, Spivak aims for a more nuanced understand- ing of ideology that can dispute subaltern women’s reputed accessibility. First, the beneficent impulse to transmit the other’s authentic voice presupposes a “monolith [. . .] [called] ‘women’ . . . whose unfractured subjectivity allows them to speak for themselves” (278).

However, and despite his own practice as a writer, Lovecraft as a theorist rightly emphasized in his oft-­ repeated formula that what was crucial to the effectiveness weird fiction was the ‘atmosphere […] the hint’ (emphasis mine) of these ‘assaults of chaos’. The British weird tradition, as I present it in this study, is far more engaged in atmosphere and hints than with direct representations of ‘unplumbed space’. Wells and Hodgson aside, the direct representation of the macrocosm is the explicit concern of science fiction. In order to avoid unnecessary pettifogging in this regard, for the purposes of this book, I (again) regard it as outside its immediate purview, despite acknowledging the Brit…",

Genette’s unwilling allusion to Barthes is also signiﬁcant in that it rein- forces the move into a concern with perversity, eroticism and love that occurs in Palimpsests with the introduction of the idea of palimpsestuous reading and that characterizes Barthes’ writing and thought.7 Subsequent work in intertextuality studies has taken up these themes, not least drawing attention to the gendered nature of the divisions which charac- terize its theories. In their introduction to Intertextuality (1990), Judith Still and Michael Worton note that ‘theories of intertextuality have, from the outset, referred at least obliquely to sexual hierarchies’ (p. 29):",

The pinnacle of pessimist logic, carried to its extreme, is the undermining of the pessimist project itself. We can qualify this further, paying particular attention to pessimism not just as a “bad attitude” but as a philosophical position – tenuous though it is. In the history of philosophy, pessimism is generally split between two views: a moral pessimism and a metaphysical pessimism.190 In moral pessimism, one expresses an attitude about the world that takes the worst possible view of things.

It is precisely in the way that hauntings in phantom persecution films are not definitively settled, that characterizes the hauntological approach and more specifically its Levinasian and Derridean elements. The brutal and unceasing persecution of the victim by the phantom persecutor surprisingly expresses the fundamental contours of the ethical relationship between the self and the other, long the cornerstone of Levinas’s ethical philosophy, and crucial in Derrida’s later “turn” to ethics.6 Yet the notion that Levinas’s and Derrida’s focus on ethics, described sum-",

To the calculative drive toward the genomic harvesting of our shared bioheritage, Haraway works to create a transformative science that creates dynamic complementarities between technologies of creation and nurturing. To the “informatics of domination” of instrumental science, she responds with a creative vision stressing the contingent, the partial, the interruption. It is definitely not customary for feminist theory to be so at- tentive to the presence among us humans of cyborgs, replicants, zombies, and aliens. It is even less usual for feminist theory to take its performative cues from the language of hard science itself. Yet this is precisely the charismatic quality of Haraway’s feminism—not for her a feminism that would recapitulate the identity-logic of traditional patriarchy nor a mode of feminism that would disap- pear the contingency of life itself (the partiality, indeterminacy,",

Accepting the assumption that Enigmatic and Pragmatic belong to both male and female opens a path for maintaining the dialectic tension of differences and similarities between men and women. It is a way to open the spectrum involving what Quindeau (2013) calls the dissociation of the sexual, which separates the sexual sphere from that of reproduction,3 and in that sense eliminates biological differences between the sexes and perceives differences as simply a product of heterosexual cultural norms.

Heilmann argues that the position of the Greek alpha- bet in the last phase of Kittler’s work challenges key assumptions around the broader tenets of Kittler’s theory and his central position within German media theory. In late Kittler, the Greek alphabet and its letters unify writing, the sounds of spoken language, musical notes, and math- ematical numbers. As such, the alphabet becomes a self-effacing yet all- powerful channel for the transmission of all aspects of Greek culture, from poetry to music and mathematics and from the arts to science and the senses.

Just as Johnston looked to the subject to think a transcendental materialism that could then be read alongside the ontologies of such thinkers as Badiou, Malabou uses the neurological conception of plasticity as an example of a mutability that remains an important, if underdeveloped, trope in such thinkers as Kant, Hegel, Heidegger, and Derrida. More than that, she also thinks “plasticity” is the “new motor scheme” that replaces previous Western",

Such a revised reading of modern art may then provide a means of approaching the transformations inherent in Blanchot’s fictions, which seem to follow an equivalent path of prosaic abstraction and intensification. Undoubtedly Blanchot’s early fictions follow in the vein of Surrealism, although one perhaps closer to Jean Paul and Lautréamont than Breton or Aragon, and in doing so they focus on the inherent mystery of the writing process, its endless capacity for positing (and thereby negating) meaning.

Pornography, Film and Feminism MAGGIE HUMM It is often claimed nowadays that we have entered a period of feminist criticism even if there are many debates over what techniques are actually feminist. Yet there is no area in which feminist criticism has been formulated so theoretically, and has dominated so conclusively, as in the realm of contemporary film writing. Since 1975, when Laura Mulvey and others first linked sexual representation in film with an implied male voyeur, feminist theories about the 'gaze' have acquired the weight of orthodoxy in film criticism. To fail to use gaze theory as a critical starting- point is to be devalued as a serious film critic. Of course, the issue is not only about how particular film techniques are constructed in a submissive/dominant diegesis but also about their cumulative effect on women and men in a society…",

Cixous ac- counts for this difference by forging the concept of ecriture feminine, fraught with the existential and historical position of the female in the world that mar- ginalizes the human subject, but that effectively redeems it through the ways it offers anyone, male or female, a living relation with language and experience.

The second sense of hauntology refers to that which (in actuality) has not yet happened, but which is already effective in the virtual (an attractor, an anticipation shaping current behaviour). The ‘spectre of communism’ that Marx and Engels had warned of in the first lines of the Communist Manifesto was just this kind of ghost: a virtuality whose threatened coming was already playing a part in undermining the present state of things. In addition to being another moment in Derrida’s own philosophical project of deconstruction, Specters of Marx was also a specific engagement with the immediate historical context provided by the disintegration of the Soviet empire.

In that sense, she remains indebted to Cixous, as both writers believe that women’s empower- ment lies in the exploration of writing, and more precisely in the interrela- tion of such writing with the body. However, Maso adds the misrecognized power of the materiality of books to Cixous’s emphasis on language’s ability to affect women’s representations of their body. This emphasis on materiality is important because it clarifies the writ- ing and reading method Cixous calls for in “The Laugh of the Medusa” and “Sorties,” where her description of a bodily text remains abstract. In shifting the focus from a linguistic exploration to a linguistic and mate- rial exploration, Maso allows us to experience a bodily text. Such a text",

Straight Movie Males and the Sexual Gaze Before turning to a discussion of male body genres, I want to revisit the important issue of gaze theory, since it relates to active and passing forms of looking in film texts and to shifts in patterns of spectatorship that have an impact on how films get made and marketed.

An infant’s tactile relation with its mother’s body provides an orientation for the infant’s drives. Kristeva often uses the term chora in conjunction with the term semiotic: her phrase “the semiotic chora” reminds the reader that the chora is the space in which the meaning that is produced is semiotic: the echolalis, glossolalias, rhythms, and intonations of an infant who does not yet know how to use language to refer to objects, or of a psychotic who has lost the ability to use language in a properly meaningful way.

Yet whether the film is interpreted here as leading us to the self-­shattering experience of jouissance or the self-­shattering experience of pain or trauma, it is clear that Noé’s use of noise destroys an anthropocentric framework of subjectivity that would allow a subject to con- stitute a world, a relationship with a diegetic spatial environment on-­screen, leaving us instead exposed to Nancy’s vibratory model, dissolving the body’s integrity and stable boundaries through the penetration of resonance and re-­ sounding.

The logical outcome of this approach makes desire precisely impossible and inarticulable. This suggests that there would always be some- thing left over from any articulation of desire. Yet, desire is the only possible way for the subject to recover his lost being by means of a fantasy and with the mediation of an object a.

A Media Ontology does not distinguish between thought and machine, for the machine bears the materialization of thought.

In constant contact, the lips create autoerotic pleasure but also defy division into one and other, or sameness and difference (Irigaray 1985a: 24). Always touching, their proximity deﬁes separation and also union. Ziarek comments: . . . the two lips indicate an interplay which refuses the terms of difference and identity. The lips, both sexual organs and the organs of language, cannot be understood as either two distinct and separate lips or as parts of a uniﬁed, “same,” structure.

To return to Kristeva’s schematisation of the pre-​conditions for a revo­ lution in poetic language (Revolution), I argue that Acker’s secret feminist history and punk writing closes the gap between women’s revolutionary desires articulated from the 1960s onwards and the available means of representing them. Her writing is that contestatory “representational break” that Fredric Jameson doubts the possibility of in postmodern culture (54). As punk feminist writer she takes on the role of authentic avant-​gardism advocated by Jean-​François Lyotard, who “observe[s]‌ that the true process",

Similarly, she is critical of traditional Marxist models which reduced all relations of inequality to class. She argues that rather than abandoning attempts to explain inequality, we should be developing theories of gender, class, and ethnicity which recognise the intersections between them and which place them in the context of the international division oflabour. To do so we need to retain the structural concepts of patriarchy, capitalism and racism. She concludes: We do not need to abandon the notion of causality in the face of the complexity of the social world. We do not have to move from analysis of structure to that of discourse to catch that",

According to Hansen, by the time of his highly influential 1936 essay called “The Work of Art in the Age of Its Mechanical Reproduction,” Benjamin had largely dropped the occult and demonic associations of the term and come to speak of it as irremediably in decay. Aura was not to be understood as an eternal value bearing the unchanging meaning of an object but rather as the manner in which it can mean something for a contemporary public, inseparable from the historically changing ways of its reception. 16.

Benjamin’s influence on the development of authenticity is significant for two principal reasons. First, he grants to objects and artworks a form of authenticity which is structurally similar to the one already accorded to human beings, namely one that is not primarily dependent on external ascription but which resides in the object as such. This authenticity is grounded in the artwork’s incorporation in ritualistic habits of religion, magic or secularized alternatives like the cult of beauty. Although the ritual which invests the artwork with such authenticity could itself be considered a form of external attribution, it is in the very nature of the ritual to conceal this agency by invoking the sacred status of the object in question. As a result, it is impos-",

As discussed, this idea originates in twentieth-century quantum physics and has been applied to the work of cultural critique by Barad (2007). According to Barad, entanglement is a provocation to a key principle of Western metaphysics: the belief that the world is populated with individuals, or individual things, each with their own set of determinate properties (2007: 19). Eschewing such a picture of reality, entanglement functions not merely as a synonym for interconnectedness or interdependency, nor any kind of relationship that assumes the a priori existence of individuals or objects. Barad explains that the experimental data of quantum physics shows that there are no pre-existing objects and subjects, but that these emerge from …",

It was helped by the temporary con- vergence of a redefinition of writing and the woman's cause. Her recent texts talk about burning and, especially, about alignment with poetry to the point of fetishisation. …",

This is precisely where Serres’ philosophy of communication really begins – with the ineradicable noise of the medium. Noise is the presence of the medium, or put still more simply, ‘There are channels and thus there must be noise.’ 8 In our usual notions of communication, noise is an unwanted third thing that interferes in what would other wise be a clear connection between a sender and a receiver.

As Haraway suggests in ‘A Manifesto for Cyborgs,’ technology no longer plays a dialectical role as the Other of humanity; instead, that otherness exists within the ‘human,’ thereby denaturalizing assumptions about the relation between the body and cultural identity, especially gender and racial identities.19 Cyberpunk science fiction would therefore represent a cultural site where the construction of such identities and the whole apparatus of subject-constitution could be interrogated. Andrew Ross associates Haraway’s argument with ‘the postmodernist cri­ tique of identity’ in general, as ‘a contemporary response to the social condition of modern life, teeming with the fantasies and realities of difference that characterize a multicultural, multisexual world.’20 In fact, Haraway’s use of the cyborg as a figure for partial, hybrid ‘identities’ rewrites the narrative of the",

This would come close to what she, Cixous—in the wake of the French philos- opher Georges Bataille rephrasing Freud—had called a feminine economy, a li- bidinal organization based on spending, rather than on retention and which, for cultural reasons, would be more on the side of women. Here it can be assumed that the force of ecriture feminine works especially in the play between thematic and linguistic registers. For this reason, spending in Lispector is not just orga- nized topically but is also worked through language, especially in later texts like Agua viva. Clarice Lispector is known for her writerly innovations and experi- mentations, and Cixous is much aware of this. This kind of writing, with no ex- change or market value, with no \"useful purpose,\" can be called ecriture femi-",

But Promethea’s insistence that Cixous write she is loved raises for her the more difﬁcult question of receiving love, not loving. Giving, Cixous says, ‘requires no courage, but to receive love so much strength, so much patience, and so much generosity must be extended’ (1991a: 105). Why would this be the case? Why would receiv- ing love invoke such hyperbolic description? It seems apparent that Cixous is again referring to ways of living subjectivity, namely, to the relational possibilities that a feminine love generates. To receive love, at least to receive it in the way Promethea means, a way that escapes debt economies, requires the willingness to risk moving out of one/self, towards the other. It requires the surrender of one/self, and in Cixous’ understanding of feminine subjectivity, as we have seen, such an act amounts to surrendering an attachment to oneself as the site or source of being.",

Mulvey observes that there are three sets of looks involved in cinema: (1) the camera’s look at the pro-filmic reality, (2) the audience’s look at the final film product, and (3) the characters’ looks at each other. The conventions of narrative cinema strive to make the audience forget the camera and the fact that they are watching a film. They work to deny both (1) and (2) in favour of (3) — all in the interests of creating a ‘convincing’ illusion of a world where the male protagonist acts as the spectator’s surrogate (Mulvey 1989c: 26). In the narrative structure, too, the male drives the story forward, while the female has a passive role, linked to her status as spectacle.

However, this presence does challenge the view that the male spectator is almost always situated in an active, sadistic position and the female spectator in a passive, masochistic one.

Part I presents a detailed discussion of at least five faces of the monstrous-feminine in relation to Julia Kristeva's theory of the abject and the maternal.

In the pre-Oedipal phase the child babbles, rhythmically: the sounds are representative (though not by the rules of language) of some of the experiences which the child is undergoing in aperiod when she or he is still domina ted by the mother. This semiotic 'babble' thus represents/is connected with 'feminised' experience, which is of course available at this stage to both male and female children. Kristeva argues that this feminised experience is not completely repressed either by male or by female children, but that it resurfaces in adult life as a kind",

In particular, it offers a way of bridging the gap between the notion of love as a locus of exploitation and that of love as a force that can conquer oppression.

Deﬁning materiality, the body, and na- ture as products of discourse has skewed discussions of these topics. Ironically, although there has been a tremendous outpouring of schol- arship on “the body” in the last twenty years, nearly all of the work in this area has been conﬁned to the analysis of discourses about the body. While no one would deny the ongoing importance of discursive cri- tique and rearticulation for feminist scholarship and feminist politics, the discursive realm is nearly always constituted so as to foreclose at- tention to lived, material bodies and evolving corporeal practices. …",

In the Preface to the second volume of The Accursed Share, he addressed the 'paradox' of showing the 'absurdity' of a completely servile system without any form of sovereignty: a world without some kind of sovereignty, he writes, 'is the most unfavourable one; but that is to say in sum that we need sovereign values, hence that it is useful to have useless values . . .' (p. 239). This is self-criticism. There is a similar problem con­ cerning the mobile borders between restricted production and general consumption. Bataille observes that he 'could not prevent consumption from being seen as something useful, even to production itself'. The second volume, he continues, will …",

By writing repeatedly about the sheer materiality of writing, by ‘putting things on the most material level’, Barthes signs a commitment to Saussure that works against doxa.

Specifically, this speculatively empowered ethical pessimism engenders a novel response to the age- old existential problem of meaning. By embracing a speculatively emergent ethical pessimism grounded on the claims of the contemporary sciences, I suggest that we can finally identify the absolute meaning, moral value, and ultimate purpose of human existence, and indeed even existence itself, although admittedly not in a way which is easy to accept. Nevertheless, as I show, this new account of the absolute and inhuman meaning and purpose of existence has some strategic advantages; namely, it grants our moral",

      "text": "as a dismissal of the importance of affect altogether, although this was never my intention. My focus here then both starts from that interest in the social as lived in affective registers and results in the development of a warmer tone on my part. 20 Here I am making use of Silvan Tomkins’ distinction between affects (as states) and emotions (as particular expressions of those states) (1963). 21 Elspeth Probyn understands the tension between the epistemological frames of gender and our ontological experiences of the same as the basis for feminist reﬂexivity (1993). A focus on affect as that which binds the epistemological and the ontological might also be thought of as part of a reﬂexive project.

      "text": "erine Spooner’s seemingly oxymoronic concept of “happy Gothic” in Post-­ Millennial Gothic [2017]). Works of horror, in contrast, can be defined primarily by the affect they seek to elicit from consumers. In keeping with Reyes, my consideration of Gothic materiality will attend to Gothic works that use familiar Gothic conceits concerning objects to evoke negative affect. This will encompass some works generally classified for mar- keting purposes as horror but that, by virtue of using familiar Gothic elements, can be accommodated by the Gothic rubric. In Thacker’s In the Dust of This Planet, he describes horror as a kind of thought experiment that seeks to explore the world outside of our attempts to know and domesticate it—horror addresses “the enigmatic thought of the unknown” (Thacker 2011, 8–9) and is, in Thack- er’s opinion, thus “a non-­philosophical attempt to think about the world-­ without-­us philosophically” (9). My approach to the Gothic, which draws",

      "text": "In his attempt to distinguish erotic art and pornography, Webb relies on a familiar set of oppositions: aesthetic value versus bad art, emotion versus action and love versus sex. Again, as in the arguments of Steven Marcus and Roger Scruton dis- cussed above, there is a juggling of aesthetic and moral criteria in order to justify one category of representations and to invalidate another. In all three cases love is lined up on the side of eroticism and pornography is dismissed as the base depic- tion of sex. Of course, what is missing in all these examples, and what therefore renders all three analyses redundant, is the question of power. The evocation of blanket terms such as ‘love’ and ‘human relations’ can, as we have seen, work to hide a range of cultural, sexual and moral norms in a hazy mist of universal consen- sus. In 1990 an exhibition held in San Francisco and called Drawing the…",

She has published essays on a vast range of subjects: philosophy, style, \"camp\", film, pornography, fascism, photography, and illness. But the main issues she tackles are concerned with aesthetics and ethics. Her critical essay on Illness as Metaphor (1978) examines how illnesses such as TB and cancer have been seen as mysterious afflictions. Metaphors are constructed according to the trends of the times. 77",

      "text": "tracing Kristeva’s active role in producing a new theory of the subject serves three important purposes: first, it points out her role in pushing psychoanalysis to new limits; and secondly, it shows how some of her most compelling literary analyses developed – for instance, her influ- ential reading of the avant-garde provocateur Louis-Ferdinand Céline. And not least, it also provides a somewhat reassuring intellectual ground for approaching her very least reassuring and most notoriously difficult theoretical concept: abjection. In order to go forward, the discussion in this chapter will go back, identifying within the sprawling project of poststructuralism a specific territory, claimed by psychoanalysts and others, devoted to a theory of subjectivity. I will explore Kristeva’s own contribution to such a project, stressing the important turn involved in the theory of abjection. Abjection…",
