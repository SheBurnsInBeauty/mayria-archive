things but of images as well” (180). She calls for a “conservationist” approach to the dissemination of photographs that would prevent the public from becom- ing inured to the suffering of others (180). Of course, the rationing of images is not a solution that could ever have been carried out. Indeed, she could not have imagined in 1978 the vast archive of images that would, in a few decades, be instantly available to anyone with a computer and access to the Internet. In Illness as Metaphor, published only one year after On Photography, Son- tag again explores the ethical and persuasive possibilities of the essay—this time to argue against cultural myths and metaphors about illness. If literature frightens patients away from seeking treatment, then her essay serves as a cor- rective. In arguing against metaphor, Sontag’s essay also makes a case for the superiority of the critical…

her powerful metaphor and her argument that disease is “without ‘meaning’” (AIDS and Its Metaphors, 102) is indicative of tensions in the argument of Ill- ness as Metaphor and tensions that are present throughout her long career as a writer. This chapter will examine the contributions Sontag made over a lifetime to conversations about the representation of illness and suffering, paying par- ticular attention to evidence of the uncertainties that underlie her performance of certainty. From her first works to her last, she struggles with the ambigui- ties and conflicts that, to this day, preoccupy literature and criticism about the representation of illness, risk, and pain. Her work even anticipates the split

formally innovative texts. To examine the pleasurable realm of these fictions, I propose an erotics of language, an embodied interpretive methodology that emphasizes the link between linguistic structures and the body. My interest in this methodology is influenced by Susan Sontag’s essay “Against Interpretation,” which con- demns the practice of interpretation of works of art, claiming that the inter- preter provides another text that nonetheless fails to render what the work of art really is. For Sontag, interpretation misses the “pure, untranslatable, sensuous immediacy” of art (9). Instead, Sontag proposes to avoid the over- emphasized focus on the content of a work by stressing form and content, which forces readers and viewers to consider their sensory experience. She 1.

ing associated with TB or cancer, AIDS or DID. Susan Sontag’s landmark study Illness as Metaphor (1978), which examines Romantic associations of tuberculosis with passion and heightened aesthetic sensibility and con- temporary portrayals of cancer as a disease of repressed emotion, argues that “the most truthful way of regarding illness—and the healthiest way of being ill—is one most puriﬁ ed of, most resistant to, metaphoric thinking” (1978, 1). The companion essay, AIDS and its Metaphors (1989) examines the dangerous, prejudicial view of AIDS as a consequence of decadence, and therefore as a judgement on certain ways of life. Her arguments con- tinue to have relevance to the contemporary syndrome novel. Finally, there is the question of whether syndrome ﬁ ction signals or par- ticipates in a recognisable cultural movement. If, as Marco Roth argues, the neurological turn emerges…

(Bellamy 1974, 40-41). Susan Sontag, one of the first critics to support the New Fiction, argues against “the project of interpretation” which she considers “stifling” because “the merit of these works lies certainly elsewhere than in their ‘meanings’” (7, 9). She notes that “a great deal of today’s art may be understood as motivated by a flight from interpretation. To avoid interpretation, art may become parody. Or it may become abstract. Or it may become (‘merely’) decorative. Or it may become non-art” (10); art employs “techniques that would fragment, dissociate, alienate, break up” (200). Indeed, the anti-representational, self-reflexive postmodern narrative “systematically sets out to short-circuit traditional interpretive temptations” (Jameson 1987, 219).4 The question of in- terpretation and interpretability leads directly to questions of com- position, of the condition…

engage the late photography theorist Susan Sontag in an inquiry over the meaning of war violence, torture, and the photographic image.4 Exploring how what she calls “frames of representability” are linked to broader social and political norms about what of late has been made to count as “grievable life” and what has not, Butler ﬁnds herself confronted with Sontag’s famous claim that, in and of itself, the photographic image does not oﬀer any sort of interpretation or understanding. According to Sontag, photography is crucial in providing aﬀect, a sentimental response, or necessary emotional reactions to the atrocious events it witnesses and captures. But, short of any accom- panying narrative, a photograph remains fragmentary in relation to meaning and understanding.5 The bits and pieces of “real life” situations photography provides the viewer with lack the narrative coherence and const…

as in Against Interpretation, Illness as Metaphor advocates a prophylactic stance against one form of rhetoric; as in On Photography, it rummages far and wide through the literature, accumulating a commonplace book’s worth of quotations on the subject; it indicts psychology and America; it corrects hyperbole in a previous work;* it resists a personal approach. If On Photography called for * “D. H. Lawrence once called masturbation ‘the deepest and most dangerous cancer of our civilization’; and I once wrote, in the heat of despair over America’s war on Vietnam, that ‘the white race is the cancer of human history’ ” (IAM, 84).

especially Sontag’s claim that photographs of suffering people would be dangerous because they are not critical enough. They trigger specific responses, Sontag observes, without providing the necessary, highly com­ plex and nuanced contextual knowledge required to truly understand the suffering depicted on these photographs (see Sontag 2004: 91). Butler observes: ‘Sontag’s concern is that the photograph substitutes for the event to such an extent that it structures memory more effectively than either understanding or narrative’ (Butler 2009: 70–1). According to Sontag, the problem with this observation lies, in Butler’s words, ‘with the triumph of a fixed sentiment over more clearly cognitive capacities’ (Butler 2009: 71). The photographs, this idea goes, would frame the suf­ fering they depict in a ‘closed’ manner because they are meant to spark a specific emotion, one that makes it possible to reduce something as com­

Sontag vaguely allows that such general anesthesia might have cer- tain exceptions. ‘‘The ethical content of photographs is fragile. With the pos- sible exception of photographs of those horrors, like the Nazi camps, that have gained the status of ethical reference points, most photographs do not keep their emotional charge’’ (21). Other critics, however, make the opposite claim, arguing that the repetition of certain, by now iconic, Holocaust images, rather than anchoring their singularly ethical status, functions to blunt the imagina- tion and to provide an unacknowledged alibi for forgetting. See, for instance, Sybil Milton, ‘‘Images of the Holocaust,’’ Holocaust and Genocide Studies 1, no. 1 (1986): 27–61. The rhetoric and problem of anesthetization raises larger questions about the imp…

or room for more?), both ‘‘easily detachable’’ and altogether dangerous.4 In Sontag’s narrative, the supplement becomes an issue of resistance to and desire for more of the image: Images of atrocity, with their power to transﬁx, compel through a power of sheer fascination, a form of compul- sive attraction (perhaps one of the century’s many pathologies of addic- tion, the attachment with diminishing returns), which, in repetition of the experience of dissatisfaction, eventually neutralizes the force of encounter, canceling the shock effects of the image. No longer the medium of a frightful but possibly instructive and even ethical encounter, the photo- graph of ultimate horror now transmits only the negative returns of the banal and the same: the same predictable negativity, the image in its lack of (proper) effect, the narcissistic dead end of an anesthetized, benumbed, impotent viewer.…

7. Although the demonization of human difference—social, sexual, or medical— is clearly an irrational process—hence the deployment of this strategy in the always-irra- tional Gothic text—Susan Sontag provides an explanation, if not a rationale for the impulse. In “AIDS and Its Metaphors,” Sontag explains the slippage by which fear of the illness (or disability) translates into fear of the ill (or disabled) person; the victim thus replaces the condition, becoming the ﬁgure of mystery and murder. Thus the “stigmati- zation of certain illnesses” leads “by extension” to the stigmatization of “those who are ill” (99). Of course, the Gothic mode possesses all the apparatus to present such a human, yet inhuman, monster. 8. Conversely, some of the texts discussed in this collection present moments in which the failure of modern medicine results in a relapse into superstitious and supernat- ural …

of this are Strand’s Blind Woman and Avedon’s portraits of his dying father. Sontag feels that ‘. . . the surrealist preferences which rule photographic taste’ (p. 104) allow this ‘cruelty’ to produce another type of beauty, and although idealising remains the objective of portraiture, commercial and everyday photography in general, it is the crueller side of photography that is more highly regarded as art. Even compassionate photojournalism has to meet two different criteria; our surrealist way of looking at photographs and our belief that photographs can give truthful information about important events. Sontag gives as an example W. Eugene Smith’s photograph of a dying boy on his mother’s lap (from the Minamata series documenting the mercury poisoning of a Japanese fishing village). Sontag feels our indignation is aroused by the suffering shown in these photographs but that they distance us ‘. . . because they are superb photographs of Agony

In her last essay, “The Image-World,” Sontag returns to the theme she had stated rather shrilly at the beginning, when she warned that we were becoming “addicted” “image junkies” drowning in “mental pollution.” What she cannot forgive photography is its ubiquity. Part of her argument has to do with the consequences of image-over- load in photographs depicting suffering. After World War II, the first photographs from the Nazi death camps had great impact—certainly on her as a teenager, she reports. But, she insists,

disaster, gloat over horror and operate on the principle that ‘if it bleeds, it leads’. This is not to say that these representational products of human atrocities are utterly devoid of feeling but, instead, and in reference to their receiver, they are now free- floating and impersonal. They lie for a while and vanish later on. The one-time spectacle of imagery appears to be changing. Employing the ideological theorization of Susan Sontag, whose image function lies under a strictly photographic aesthetic of death, I explore the overwhelming plague invading the purposeful aspect of the shock. This plague, in the form of a mighty effect, spreads fast within the virtual land of television and infects the cognitive geography of the receiver. It is a reinterpretation of the shock within the virtual geography of the image under the custody of contemporary culture. The discussion gives insight into a somehow

provides the viewer with lack the narrative coherence and constancy Sontag believes is necessary for proper representation and realization. Butler counters Sontag’s perspective by claiming that, on the contrary, the photographic frame itself already contains and enables certain interpretations. The photographic image, Butler suggests, is as much about what is contained in the image as it is about what is outside the frame of the photo, and thus kept unnoticed, unseen, invisible, or occluded (purposefully or not). As such, she goes on to state that “interpretation is not to be conceived restrictively in terms of a subjective act … [since it] takes place by virtue of the structuring constraints of genre and form on the communicability of aﬀect.”6 Butler fur- ther argues that “it is not just that the photographer and/or the viewer actively and deliberately interpret, but that the photograph…

of reference a cultural change in the perceptual indifference to the shock. To argue within a culture of spectatorship is to look where the objects of contemplation are backed up by tools of great influence: big chunks of high quality imagery reflecting fear and anxiety are covered by a cultural layer of consumerism, captured on television and broadcasted around the globe in seconds and flow around wrapped by the magic of the spectacle. This new media with its bedazzled look requires us to rethink the shock. Here, an issue emerges. In our culture of spectatorship, have we lost the power to be shocked? Sontag’s photographical dialect acts as a reference for discussion as she asserts that disturbing images can stop to irritate our inner self following the mutation in the sphere of culture.18 The chunk of images arising from the anxious culture appears to be harmless, as Sontag explains by means of referring to the projected images as situational aspects

French writer Georges Bataille) to a subject which is offensive and yet which can be treated in terms of its form and style as art. Sontag’s attack on critics who wish to view art as an imitation or commentary on the world culminates in her masterpiece, On Photography (1977). In this collection of essays, originally published in the mid-1970s in The New York Review of Books, she rejects the ideas that photographs are a realistic representation of reality. On the contrary, she regards photography as surrealistic, a term she defines in ‘Happenings’ (included in Against Interpretation) as the ‘idea of destroying conventional meaning, and creating new meanings, or counter-meanings through radical juxtaposition (“the collage principle”).’ Thus photography includes or juxtaposes contrary elements—moving abruptly between different environments, time periods, cultures, classes, objects—and unites them in a ‘realistic’ frame. But this frame, she argues, is simply another aspect of

of popular culture. Sontag’s aim is that we should enjoy camp but also take it seriously. To do this it must be elevated so that it can take its place as a lesser art, but an art no less. This is certainly one way of seeing it, but since the mid-1960s camp has also provided a momentum for the creation of postmodern culture, where the boundaries of high and low art are irrevocably blurred, and where camp detaches itself from the subcultural world of the gay scene and enters into mainstream, roaming free in the field of popular entertainment, while retaining an affectionate attachment to gay culture.

it is also the case that the stories one tells are never entirely one’s own. The poststructuralist view that identity and knowledge are socially constructed by dominant narratives can lead to the more skeptical conclusion that per- sonal narratives—even the most heartfelt personal narratives of depression posted anonymously online—are always already ideological, shaped by myths and metaphors that, while they may vary from culture to culture and over time, have remarkable sticking power. Susan Sontag made this point about metaphorical constructions of tuberculosis, cancer and AIDS, argu- ing that these support “the excommunicating and stigmatizing of the ill”; in her view these constructions can and should be resisted, the ideal being “to detach [illness] from these meanings.”20 Not so easy, however: in telling the story of cancer (in obituaries, for instance), one slips inevitably into battle mode, and every reader will understand.

partly through the proliferation of such images of horror. One’s ﬁrst en- counter with the photographic inventory of ultimate horror is a kind of revelation, the prototypically modern revelation: a negative epiphany. For me, it was photographs of Bergen-Belsen and Dachau which I came across by chance in a bookstore in Santa Monica in July 1945.’’2 Contingent on a certain naı¨vete´ and newness, located in the historical moment when ‘‘such’’ photographs (if of a kind they are) had not yet become so wide- spread and normalized, the wound occasioned by Sontag’s ﬁrst encounter has, she suggests, ceded to a world of nonstop exhibitions of atrocity, an anesthetizing and corrupting proliferation. ‘‘Once one has seen such im- ages, one has started down the road of seeing more—and more. Images transﬁx. Images anesthetize.’’3 Engaging the rhetoric and temporality of such anesthetizing repetition (t…

vent me from dividing subjective experience and critical inquiry into separate compartments. Susan Sontag wrote brilliantly about meta­phors of illness and the dilemmas that they create without once mentioning her own breast cancer. (Her son, David Rieff, calls Sontag’s Illness as Meta­phor “almost anti-­ autobiographical.”)6 “What I write about,” Sontag says of her nonfiction works, “is other than me.” She grants, however, a sizeable concession to her writing as a novelist: “­Needless to say, I lend bits of myself to all my characters.”7 The shards of my experience that I “lend” ­here, sparingly, fall outside the memoirs of illness that scholar Ann Jurecic describes as “a thriving genre in the late twentieth and early twenty-­first centu- ries.”8 My own fragments contribute, I trust, to an emerging composite portrait of the caregiver.9 The commonness of my experience taps into …

108 SUSAN SONTAG Newspapers did not yet carry photographs when Baude- laire wrote. But this doesn't make his accusatory descrip- tion of the bourgeois sitting down with his morning newspaper to breakfast with an array of the world's hor- rors any different from the contemporary critique of how much desensitizing horror we take in every day, via televi- sion as well as the morning paper. Newer technology pro- vides a nonstop feed: as many images of disaster and atrocity as we can make time to look at. Since On Plwtography, many critics have suggested that the excruciations of war-thanks to television-have de- volved into a nightly banality. Flooded with images of the sort that once used to shock and arouse indignation, we are losing our capacity to react. Compassion, stretched to its limits, is going numb. So runs the familiar diagnosis. But what is really being asked for here? That images of carnage be cut back to, say, once a week? More generally,

exemplifies so vividly the role of perception. Some critics complained that she took a purely intellectual approach to photography; the book has no illustrations and the text is notable for her obvious lack of interest in interpreting specific images. But this was exactly Sontag’s point: ‘I came to realize that I wasn’t writing about photography so much as I was writing about modernity, about the way we are now. The subject of photography is a form of access to contemporary ways of thinking and feeling. And writing about photography is like writing about the world.’ Perhaps the single most important influence on Sontag here was Walter Benjamin’s Susan Sontag 219

118 SUSAN SONTAG Some of the reproaches made against images of atroc- ity are not different from characterizations of sight itself. Sight is effortless; sight requires spatial distance; sight can be turned off (we have lids on our eyes, we do not have doors on our ears). The very qualities that made the an- cient Greek philosophers consider sight the most excel- lent, the noblest of the senses are now associated with a deficit. It is felt that there is something morally wrong with the abstract of reality offered by photography; that one has no right to experience the suffering of others at a dis- tance, denuded of its raw power; that we pay too high a human (or moral) price for those hitherto admired quali- ties of vision-the standing back from the aggressiveness of the world which frees us for observation and for elec- tive attention. But this is only to describe the function of the mind itself. There's nothing wrong with standing back and think-

character of a text. We ﬁnd early examples of the formalist approach in such essays as Susan Sontag’s ‘‘Against Interpretation’’ and ‘‘Godard’s Vivre Sa Vie,’’ both of 1964, in which Sontag argues that critical interest should be formal rather than thematic and that the most gripping contemporary works of art are interesting because of the immediacy of their images and their handling of problems of form. Sontag’s essays stand at the beginning of a long line of critical work that, for diverse reasons, emphasizes the formal at the expense of the thematic in its discussions of the postmodern. The thematic approach is already present in some of Charles Olson’s essays of the 1950s and in Leslie Fiedler’s and Ihab Hassan’s work of the 1960s. What is emphasized here is a postmodern attitude, expressed through a variety of themes, that resists the modernist intellectualization of experience and …

Psychiatry series has shown that classical psychiatry is not the only discipline interested in and indeed capable of defining and interpreting the mind and its disorders. Recent studies in the philosophy of psychiatry and the phenomenol- ogy of psychopathology have explored crucial questions about the nature and definition of mental disorder, the conceptual underpinnings of mental health care, and the subtle changes to bodily feelings and perception that characterize certain experiences as exceptional (Bolton, 2008; Ratcliffe, 2008; Stanghellini, 2004; Thornton, 2007).

constellated here and in the coming chapter, there is a ready canonical touchstone in the critical literature. Many are the mortal threats found posed, and thus ideologically propounded, in the 1950s heyday of the sci-­fi genre diagnosed in Susan Sontag’s famous “Imagination of Disas- ter” essay from 1966.6 While noting the generous budgeting of special effects as central both to the genre’s “charm” and to its realist conviction (though not in any particular way, for her, to its thematic purchase), Son- tag identifies figurative threats in the individual as much as apocalyptic vein, metaphoric crises biological as well as interplanetary in the weight of their radical “alienations.” One is struck in retrospect, however, with the medial valence of certain imagined disasters—­certain, say, disaster imaging—­amid her rolodex of examples, films listed by her as sociological litmus tests rather than enlisted for visual analysis.

Illness often transports patients and ­family and caregivers into an unreasonable, uncanny, inverse realm where knowledge is far less common than not-­knowing.

in the way that analogy or simile might, but exactly what that form might be remains elusive.3 Initially, using images to produce and elicit forms of temporal experi- ence might seem counterintuitive.4 After all, images, particularly the still photographs included in Foer’s text, represent stable and self-contained slivers of time. Functioning by analogy and simile, they tend to reduce, hypostatize, and impose meaning on a constantly moving reality better captured through cinema’s diachronic form. My readings will nevertheless suggest that Foer’s novel and Spiegelman’s comix successfully overcome this reductive aspect of images, enlisting them to portray specifically tem- poral forms of knowing. Advocating a contingent and fully temporalized mode of knowing as the best antidote for Oskar’s trauma, Foer privileges process over content and uses images performatively. Seeking a r…

Susan Sontag . o PHOTOGRAPHS OBJECTIFY: they turn an event or a person into something that can be possessed. And photographs are a species of alchemy, for all that they are prized as a transparent account of reality. Often something looks, or is felt to look, "better" in a photograph. Indeed, it is one of the functions of photography to improve the normal appearance of things. (Hence, one is always disappointed by a photograph that is not flattering.) Beautifying is one classic operation of the camera, and it tends to bleach out a moral response to what is shown. Uglifying, showing something at its worst, is a more modern function: didactic, it invites an active response. For photographs to accuse, and possibly to alter conduct, diey must shock. An example: A few years ago, the public health authorities in

As we have seen, Malek Alloula diagnoses the effects and politics of postcards of Algerian women taken by the French occupying Algeria, and Zahid Chaudhary discusses the role of the camera in the British occupation of India. 4. It is interesting to note that Sontag concludes that photography accomplishes a feat to which literature hopelessly aspires—simultaneously providing a copy of reality and an inter- pretation of it—while using metaphors of textuality, interpretation, and transcription to de- scribe photography. In other words, even while attributing a privilege to photography over literature. 5.

In what might appear to be a reprise of Susan Sontag’s well-­known argument in “Against Interpretation”—­a stirring manifesto for an erotics rather than a hermeneutics of art—­critics have questioned the value of reducing art to its po­liti­cal utility or philosophical premises, while offering alternative models for engaging with literary and cultural texts. For example, Stephen Best and Sharon Marcus argue that symptomatic reading, as one of the most influential forms of critique, relies on question- able meta­phors of depth, concealment, and hiddenness.

& 245 Illness and Death and then a stiff block on the funeral bier. I have to say that I don’t like those photographs. It’s not just that they are opportunistic—I could forgive that if they were great images—but that they’re mediocre photographs, not insightful, not art- fully composed, and on top of that, opportunis- tic. The Sontag who appreciated only the finest photography deserved better. Then again, Sontag submitted, while she was alive, to posing for Liebovitz and allowing can- did photographs to be taken of her in sickness and in health. Snapshots have never been Lie- bovitz’s forte—where she excels is the carefully composed studio shot, with lighting technicians and hair stylists, the Vanity Fair cover—but some of her snapshots of Sontag, embarking or dis- embarking en route to somewhere, with a look of exhaustion held under restraint, waiting for enthusiasm to kick in, have a sorrowful elegance that is very moving. The famous description of

110 W. G. Sebald’s The Rings of Saturn repertoire of a few photographs shown as representative images, Marianne Hirsch has observed, The repeated Holocaust photographs connect past and present through the ‘‘having-been-there’’ of the photographic image. They are messengers from a horriﬁc time that is not distant enough. In repeatedly exposing themselves to the same pictures, postmemorial viewers can produce in themselves the effects of traumatic repetition that plague the victims of trauma. Even as the images repeat the trauma of looking, they disable, in themselves, any restorative attempts.43 One wonders how to read Hirsch’s use of the verb ‘‘can’’ (‘‘postmemorial viewers can produce in themselves the effects of traumatic repetition’’), and what to make of the ‘‘ability’’ it implies. As a description of the possi- ble, the passage suggests a neutral, nonafﬁrmative and nonpathologizing,…

of having transformed its spectacles and pleasures into a great web of symptoms and a seedy exchange of signs."12J A~ Ranciere argues, this desire to atone for the perceived excesses of symptomatic reading leads Barthes to create a false impasse between the cognitive act of demystifying interpretation (in which, according to Barthes, the photographic image is reduced to "discourse encoding his- tory") and a purely affective response (in which the photographic image is similarly reduced to "raw material presence").'24 As if to repent of "having spent much of his life saying: 'Look out! What you are taking for visible self-evidence is ill fac.l an encoded message whereby a society or authority legitimates itself by nmralizing itself,' " Barthes develops his concept of studium as that which invites passionless mechanical aca- '. , demic decoding so he can directly oppose it to t…

20 SUSAN SONTAG hour-is (unlike the world) a very small place, both geo- graphically and thematically, and what is thought worth knowing about it is expected to be transmitted tersely and emphatically. Awareness of the suffering that accwnulates in a select nwnber of wars happening elsewhere is something con- structed. Principally in the form that is registered by cam- eras, it flares up, is shared by many people, and fades from view. In contrast to a written account-which, de- pending on its complexity of thought, reference, and vo- cabulary, is pitched at a larger or smaller readership--a photograph has only one language and is destined poten- tially for all. In the first important wars of which there are accounts by photographers, the Crimean War and the American Civil War, and in every other war until the First World War, combat itself was beyond the camera's ken. As for the war photographs published between 1914 and 1918,

in reality, “I” feels compelled to create an alternative one, a psychic and aesthetic reality in which the lover’s image is preserved: As I embalm you in memory, the first thing I shall do is hook out your brain through your accommodating orifices. Now that I have lost you I cannot allow you to develop, you must be a photo- graph not a poem. You must be rid of life, as I am rid of life. (119) More than a reflection of personal grief, the compulsion to trans- form Louise into a photographic image immune to time, change, and bodily decay suggests the degree to which the narrator’s response to loss takes the form of a melancholic incorporation, a response that has specific personal and social consequences. Giorgio Agamben has offered a provocative interpretation of medi- eval melancholia; he defines the melancholic temperament as a nego- tiation between the individual and the social, …

This first moment, then, of a sense of the constriction of the total system, of its inescapability even for the imagination, is what can help us once again draw a firmer line between "radicalism" and "liberalism." For the liberal view is generally characterized by the belief that the "system" is not really total in that sense, that we can ameliorate it, reorganize it, and regulate it in such a way that it becomes tolerable and we thereby have the "best of both worlds." Susan Sontag's wonderful book on photography is exemplary in this respect (her conception of "image lust" is a cognate of Michaels's vision of the market and consumption, but also a significant variant and alternate way of talking about that): her conclusion about contemporary image culture is the classically liberal recommendation of a kind of "diet cure" for images, Iwhat she calls a "conservationist remedy": "I…

indefiniteness is perhaps more metaphorical than political in nature. On their own, the images speak to the struggle for truth in a culture of secrecy. Supplemented by the captions, which name the time and space of their capture, the photos become grounded; no longer just allegorical, they insert themselves more confidently into the sphere of the political. In a reversal of sorts of the established relationship between the indexicality of the photographic image and the symbolic nature of verbal language, the image becomes arbitrary while the linguistic sign purports to document empirical facts. By now we might be in a better position than at the start of this chapter to address the concept of a hermeneutics of the black site.

extremes, the practices of femininity may lead us to utter demoral- ization, debilitation, and death. (1993: 166) Looking at these images, then, we might view them in distracted fashion, often in the form of magazines which may be flicked through, their contents fragmented or re-ordered, the images lingered on or passed over. This does not mean, however, that the moment of vision, of exposure to the image, is any the less constitutive of our sense of self. As Anne Cronin argues, the act of vision stretches both forwards and back. Stretching back, it is simultaneously an act of interpretation which draws, however unconsciously, on other images, the images of memory and the Unconscious. If, as Annette Kuhn suggests, the `language of memory does seem to be above all a language of images', so that it shares with dreams and fantasies the ability to condense and displace our desires and fears into powerful images (1995: 160),10 then the power of the mass

affecting discursive sensibility, popular photography, but I did exam- ine this topic in an essay I wrote with Nancy West, “Photography, Commodities, and Post-Romantic Discourses in Hardy and Stevens,” which, like chapter 3 in this book, attempts to situate poetry in a homologous relationship to material reality. Finally, the homological method of this study pursues the analogical thinking I examine in the book by that name, Analogical Thinking, though here, as I note in the Introduction, I have learned what Stephen Jay Gould rightly describes as the “material reality” of homologies. I call on many of these previous works of mine—and others as well—with references and a small number of passages adapted from them to make the pres- ent argument. I thank the editors and publishers of previous pub- lications for permission to revise and reuse these texts in the pres- ent book. Much of this book has been presented at public forums: meet-

At least as much as they eroticize their subjects, the photographs resist the medical discourse of development. As portraits that refuse to romanticize childhood, they might initially seem to conﬁrm what Maudsley called the “unnatural precosity” of the insane child—a sexuality “which is immanent in animal nature” (285). And yet when compared with photographs that were explicitly used to diagnose mental pathology, they seem decidedly dif- ferent. They are quite unlike, for example, Hugh Welch Diamond’s portraits from the early 1850s, depicting “insanity” among the female inmates of the Surrey County Asylum—images which endeavored to capture expressions representative of various diseased states of mind. As Carroll became more and more enamored with photography, he would undoubtedly have been Figure 3.1 Lewis Carroll (C.L Dodgson), Alice Liddell as ‘The Beggar Maid,’ 1858. Developmental Non…

as that of taking a photo does not consist in passively registering an im­ age; it is, rather, a fabrication, a bringing together of an indeterminable number of heterogeneous elements (including photons and other quan­ tum phenomena, photoreceptors, various chemical reactions, neurons, objects, bodies, air, camera and computer processors, aesthetics, and many more), putting them in touch, getting them to affect one another. Reality does not get recorded in a photo; it acquires a new real aspect, a new mode of visible existence. But exposure is more than just that; it extends into the realm of ethical relations between different kinds of beings. The relations involve love, inasmuch as it is understood here, among so many other things, as my own and another’s vulnerability that follows from the ontological imperative of being exposed. The photographic exposure is both an apt dramatization of how exposure is image- and world-making and a particular deployment of

argues that a project like Millett’s “can be counterproductive” (37). Though the idea that you are being attacked by some malign force is not as factual as the idea that the force is part of you, it is nevertheless “empowering” (37) and can feel true for the person with the illness. This view runs somewhat counter to Susan Sontag’s argument, in Illness as Metaphor (1978), that illnesses such as cancer should be “de-mythicized” because so “long as a particular disease is treated as an evil . . . not just a disease, most people with cancer will indeed be demoralized by learning what disease they have” (7). Though David B. Morris acknowledges the importance of Sontag’s landmark essay, he argues that “the effort to cleanse illness of all meaning discounts the therapeutic benefit that positive myths and meaning can supply” (270).

Campbell’s and Deegan’s narratives exemplify a growing, new emphasis. In the era of identity politics, group identification and self- identity have come to receive unparalleled attention; the question “Who am I?” is inescapable. Similarly inescapable, as we saw earlier, is the in- fluence of medical framing, bringing an increased interest in the disease status of mental disorder and hence in “symptoms” in the medical sense. Today, the relation between self and symptoms is frequently addressed in memoirs such as these with explicit and sustained attention.17 Contemporary Models One or the other of two apparently incompatible frameworks or “mod- els” representing the relationship between self or identity and symptoms is to be found in many of today’s first-person descriptions.18 On a “symptom-alienating” model, we find distancing and control- ling metaphors.

the way it becomes a text in search of its own motivation, draws attention to ethical issues at the heart of the photographic discourse. In particular, the desire to produce images, especially in its connection to travel and the encoun- ter with diff erence, has been seen to intervene almost pathologically between the image-maker and real contact (Sontag 1977b: 14–15), to the extent that the photographic image even replaces experience (or at least displaces it, to use a Baudrillardian formulation, to the realm of the simulacral). The events and recordings of Twentynine Palms’ aimless movement, in their context as part of a travel fi lm, assume signifi cance only within a closed circuit. The photograph within travel, to paraphrase Sontag, no longer records something signifi cant; something becomes signifi cant only because it is photographed. We see an example of this early on in the fi lm. The initial driving sequence sketched

of images an order of response that no image need make; the projection of the writer’s actual or rhetorically assumed burden as a character of the image as other, or as ego ideal – either in an individual poesis or a wider ﬁeld of political or religious agency and argument which is a different kind of object. Of course this is one fate of art as the form of a relation, or as a symptom in the random precipitation of affect; and if it repels me, then that too is my problem, a symptom of my own and, anyway, I am not free from it, nor do I wish to be. The coming together of these three images suggests a cure, for it is an opening, nothing more; though it does open to a politics of thought that objec- tiﬁes, in the best way, the idealized subjectivity that has shaped it as a fulcrum of reﬂection. At the same time, what was that ﬂuttering if it is not a movement of the self, a moment of its fo…

chapter makes better use of these figures, even if they do not play a cen- tral role in her conception of what is to be privileged about hysteria. A thorough illumination of the linguistic representations of hysteria by other scholars would enrich our discussions. Although this book de- votes itself to the history and representations of hysteria, it has not un- earthed the hidden metaphors of hysteria. A whole book could have been written, and we hope it will be, merely on these metaphors of con- trol, pathologization, stigmatization, castigation. An example drawn from the field of metaphors of incorporation is Dorothy Kilgour's From Communion to Cannibalism: Metaphors of IncorporationHysteria has given rise to metaphors worthy of study in their own right, in much the way that Susan Sontag has identified those in the domain of illness and AIDS. We hope others will build on our work and trace the evolution of these languages of hysteria.

something striking, something that calls for explanation, is not to be taken for granted, not just natural. The object of this "effect" is to allow the spectator to criticize constructively from a social point of view.6 Pane's acts of self-induced regurgitation, exposure to glaring light, and interaction with fire qualify as striking in Brecht's sense. The photographic images resulting from these acts beg for explanation and critique, inasmuch as they document uncomfort- able, unnatural events. But, again, what is important to see in Pane's performance pho- tographs is that the critique they foster has as much to do with distant pains (met- aphorically, war wounds or poverty) as the pain one sees and feels up close. By bringing attention to the distance between "here" and "there," these photographs im- plicitly invite viewers to question how much distance is appropriate. Is one's proximi…

consistently omnipresent and problematic forms of postmodern repre- sentation – still photography and narrative ﬁction. Between them they constitute a statistically signiﬁcant number of the representations of both mass culture and high art today. The photography of postmodern- ism challenges the ideological underpinnings of both the high-art photography of modernism and the mass- (advertising, newspapers, magazines) and popular- (snapshots) cultural photographic forms. It moves out of the hermeticism and narcissism that are always possible in self-referentiality and into the cultural and social world, a world bom- barded daily with photographic images. And it manages to point at once to the contingency of art and to the primacy of social codes, making the invisible visible, ‘de-doxifying’ the doxa – be it either modernist/formalist or realist/documentary. In postmodern ﬁction, too, the d…

since the photograph is both image and object, copy and original.29 Sontag here seems to approximate the Baudrillardian sense of the world as a product of its own copies – a position that grants uncanny power to the apparatus of mechanical reproduction, and casts an intriguing light on the vein of technophobia in Danielewski’s novel. When Navidson rigs his house with motion-sensitive Hi 8 cameras to record the day-to-day dramas of a low-key domestic idyll, his technology instead captures The Novel in Hyperreality 151

of our predicament as linguistic beings” (19). Notwithstanding his sense that the positive role of melancholia has been overstated, Forter acknowl- edges the possibility that a moment of impacted melancholy (such as might be readily associated with the unspeakable) may make up a nec- essary moment of mourning, a possibility that Forter documents most specifically with reference to Alexander and Margarete Mitscherlich, The Inability to Mourn (1967) (Forter 2011: 17). 11. My recourse to semiotics, then, might be seen as potentially adding another layer to the still emergent interdisciplinarity of trauma stud- ies, as exemplified most tellingly, perhaps, by the recent articulation of psychoanalysis and neurobiology around the idea of trauma in the work of Catherine Malabou (2012). 12. In brief, semiotics is distinguished from semiology by the triadic model of the sign insisted upon…

photomontage, claiming a lineage from John Heartﬁeld and Hannah Höch and developed by Klaus Staeck and Peter Kennard. The other is closely aligned to critical theory’s reﬂections on ideology, alienation and enlightenment. HAL FOSTER provides a key example of this latter reading. Drawing on Barthes and Lacan, he interpreted Kruger’s work as the calling of language into crisis, pinpointing her as a ‘manipulator of signs more than a producer of art objects’ (Recodings, p. 100). In her use of pronouns − shifting descriptors dependent on context and interpretation, thus blocking identiﬁcation − and in her marshalling of disjunctures between image and text, connotation and denotation, the photo-text collages become destabilizing, critical responses to mediated, illusion-saturated environments. Foster recognizes Kruger’s stated commitment to undermine stereotypes (RC, pp. 22…

Susan Sontag’s point about the way we perceive zones o f absence, confinem ent, or incalculable expanse is again useful here. To distinguish between such environm ents in a visual artwork ‘is still to be looking, still to be seeing som ething’ (Styles o f Radical Will, 10). So it is for the novel; only that looking is replaced by listening since the reader attains a visual conception o f place only by hearing o f the experience o f its terrain either from characters perceiving it at firsthand, or from a shadowing narrator who beholds the effect o f their observations. This rhetorical integration o f vision and voice, sight and insight, is especially penetrating for writers in this study who have exploited the…

affect consists of a lived transition between different states that does not itself clearly or explicitly represent anything. As such, these photographs are able to present us with that which Butler, as mentioned above, char­ acterizes as ‘wordless vocalizations of suffering’ that may shock us to thought. They enable us to apprehend something about the suffering per­ sons we see on these pictures, in turn constituting critical reflection on the frames of recognition that produce the suffering and the bodies on the pictures as ‘less grievable’. An example is formed by Schönberger’s Nägel, briefly mentioned in the introduction to this book: the materiality of the countless rusty nails under one’s feet and the dark oppressive atmosphere of the space in the Schwerbelastungskörper’s belly may constitute an affective relationship with visitors. These visitors may be touched when they feel the nails grinding because of their own bodyweight, not really knowing why or

haptic elements can interact in an artwork in a dearly masochistic way. Moreover, his approach contributes to an understanding of how masochism-based works of art can serve as instructive metaphors. But he also rightly warns that the operation of metaphor, though issuing from the unconscious, should not be seen as exposing the "intentional referents or literal origins of... art." Rather, the metaphoric substance should be examined for the ways in which it expands an understanding of the art's structure as a "working over that is never purely involuntary and symptomatic or controlled and curative" (52). See also his discussion of metaphor in contrast to metonymy as operative elements in surrealist imagery and objects, respectively (52). For a reworking of this essay, see Foster, Compulsive Beauty (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1993), 87-98. 6. A provocative connection could be made here between t…

But how can we dwell on that experience long enough to avoid put- ting it in a logical frame? The answer is via reflecting persistently on the terrorizing images themselves. Image, as Heidegger has it, is pre-concep- tual, revealing much more than concept does.26 Whereas concept em- ploys rational language and conventional methodologies to describe from a distance an event or phenomenon, fictional or not, image derives from the power of imagination to evoke dream-like visual events that precede conscious language. As Walter A. Davis beautifully puts it, im- age “is the native language of anxiety, the language psyche uses in an effort to mediate the emotional and psychological impact of events. As such, a language of images has much in common with the logic of the

an existing norm; the interesting marks a tension between the unknown and the already known and is generally bound up with a desire to know and document reality.13 It is therefore arso, as Susan Sontag suggests, an aesthetic closely bound up with the history of photography.!4 Troubled by how the popular use of "interesting" as a notoriously weak evaluation tends to promote a general "indiscrimination" in the viewing public, Son- tag trenchantly notes that "the practice of photography is now identi- fied with the idea that everything in the world could be made interesting through the camera.,"15 If it has become "not altogether wrong to say that there is no such thing as a bad photograph-only less interesting [ones]," the reason why photography constitutes "one of the chief means for producing that quality ascribed to things and situations which erases these distinctiol)s" is th…

Susan Sontag . producing spectacular, beautifully composed big pictures that are said to be "cinematic." The sanctimonious Family of Man-style rhetoric that feathers Salgado's exhibitions and books has worked to the detriment of the pictures, however unfair this may be. (There is much humbug to be found, and ignored, in declarations made by some of the most admirable photographers of conscience.) Salgado's pictures have also been sourly treated in response to the commercialized situations in which, typically, his portraits of misery are seen. But the problem is in the pictures themselves, not how and where they are exhibited: in their focus on the powerless, reduced to their powerlessness. It is significant that the powerless are not named in the captions. A portrait that declines to name its subject becomes complicit, if

ing pages of his memoir, ‘it’s the opposite of dying.’10 Obviously, Sontag’s illness didn’t stop her from doing what she did most in her life – to read as well as write. But neither David Rieff’s memoir nor Katie Roiphe’s tender reconstruction of the author’s ﬁ nal months contain any suggestions that Sontag turned to ﬁ ction for help or ease. In the spring of 2004, just after she received the MDS diagnosis, Sontag was mainly reading medical publications, following up her own advice (from Illness as Metaphor) that what a patient needed in order to heal was ‘clarity, rational thought and medical informa- tion’.11 Both Roiphe and biographer Benjamin Moser mention that Sontag’s friend Peter Perrone read Tolstoy’s Death of Ivan Ilyich to her in the last month of her ﬁ nal stay in Sloan Kettering.12 Perrone had hoped the story would spark a conversation that could bring some consol…

Susan Sontag (b. 1933) is an American cultural critic and fiction writer. She has published essays on a vast range of subjects: philosophy, style, "camp", film, pornography, fascism, photography, and illness. But the main issues she tackles are concerned with aesthetics and ethics. Her critical essay on Illness as Metaphor (1978) examines how illnesses such as TB and cancer have been seen as mysterious afflictions. Metaphors are constructed according to the trends of the times. 77

nomedicine. One discursive option I have found extremely useful in sorting through the Prozac story is the work of cultural studies of science scholar Donna Haraway. If asked, Haraway might categorize herself as a postmodern feminist science historian of the present. In her writings, she has initiated a great expansion of the cyborg metaphor, and she is a major initiator of what many are calling cyber-feminism and others are calling posthumanism (Braidotti 1994, 102; Halberstam and Livingston 1995; Kirkup et al. 2000). For Haraway’s cyborg metaphor to make sense, however, it is helpful to explain what I mean by “metaphor” in this context. The surest way to misunderstand Haraway’s work is to approach it too “literally” or too “metaphorically” without rethinking the usual meanings of these terms. Haraway (in the company of most postmodern philosophers and antifoundational theorists, and consistent with my discussions of theory

Times Magazine (ﬁg. .).This self-portrait of a strikingly beauti- ful woman, Matuschka, artist, photographer, and model, presents another—and equally disturbing—way both to challenge the acceptable limits of female self-representation and to expose the effects of breast cancer surgery. It was also selected to launch the New York Times th Anniversary issue’s narrative of the nineties, a decade in which women became highly visible advocates for breast cancer awareness. The glamor and drama of the image “drew worldwide attention and won the photographer numerous awards” ();14 it helped draw attention to the politics of treatment. Matuschka’s breast was removed after she developed cancer in . In JoAnne Motichka (the artist known as Matuschka) successfully sued her doctor “for past and future pain and suffer- ing.”The jury granted her $.million, conﬁrming her claim that the doctor had misread her pathology report and performed an
