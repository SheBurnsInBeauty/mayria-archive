6 Henk Oosterling and Ewa Plonowska Ziarek the emergence ofnew technologies is further analyzed in Rosi Braidotti's article. In her theory of nomadic feminism she elaborates techno-bodies, which, by ques- tioning the boundary between functionality and eroticism, human and inhuman, organic and artificial, masculine and feminine, mark the plane of radical imma- nence as interactions and interconnections between forces. Ultimately, Braidotti asks whether the analysis of the intersections between bodies and technologies, ranging from plastic surgery to genetic engineering, calls in fact for the metamor- phosis of the subject offeminism. In response to this question she argues that the transformative possibilities emerging at the interface between· bodies and tech- nologies allow us to theorize a mobile, multiple, passionate, embodied subject of feminism, embracing the minotarian process of becoming as a condition of active

history and of utopian sexual difference,” thus demonstrating that the “event of the Anthropocene is exceptional—­but not by being extrinsic to what we have come to refer to as nature or humanity.” Like Colebrook, Rosi Braidotti takes up the question of anthropo- cene feminism in relation to the concept of the posthuman, a concept she has theorized quite extensively. In “Four Theses on Posthuman Feminism,” Braidotti thinks through anthropocene feminism as a form of posthuman feminism, beginning with the thesis that “feminism is not a humanism.” For Braidotti, feminism is resolutely antihumanist and, she adds, anti-­Eurocentric. Her second thesis, “Anthropos is off-­center,” offers a zoe-­centric relational ontology that decenters humanism not from the outside but “from philosophies of radical immanence, vital materialism, and the feminist politics of locations.” Proclaiming zoe “the ruling principle,” her third thesis urges her fellow feminists “to

into culture.87 Many contemporary scholars in the posthumanities have therefore proposed a new materiality in which the relationship between humans, other agents and material reality is framed as one of intra-​action, as opposed to ­interaction.88 This shift in perspective reframes the individual from a sovereign and separable unit to a contingent, profoundly entangled set of ­relationalities –​ offering potential for the co-​constitution of political agency through the formation of new subjectivities and new intersubjectivi­ ties. And such a dynamism is generative not merely in the sense of bringing new objects into the world but in ‘bringing forth new worlds’, of engaging in ‘an ongoing reconfiguring of the world’.89 Rosi Braidotti –​ a feminist theorist and leading figure in the new posthumanities –​ in fact positions her­ self alongside Hardt as part of a community of Spinozist scholars working

egory, but rather as a point of overlap between the physical, the symbolic, and the sociological.”28 Like Latour, then, feminist theorists of the new materialisms begin from the premise that the material and the cultural are overlapping and coextensive. For feminist new materialists, however, knowl- edge production even more speciﬁcally is a material– semiotic relation that is emphatically relational, embodied, and embedded. This is signiﬁcant because, as Braidotti points out in The Posthuman, even scholarship emerg- ing from science and technology studies such as Latour’s ultimately exhibits a “high degree of political neutrality” vis- à- vis the human (or, in Braid- otti’s terms, “posthuman”) predicament. “Science and technology studies tend to dismiss the implications of their positions for a revised vision of the subject. Subjectivity is out of the picture and, with it, a sus…

humanities, the posthumanities arrived in the twenty-first century via multiple channels. We follow the feminist path articulated by feminist philosophers Rosi Braidotti and Cecilia Åsberg.43 Braidotti asserts that the human has never been a neutral category but one always linked to power and privilege, shaped in the outline of a white, male, able-bodied Vitruvian man. We have arrived at a “posthuman conjunction,” Braidotti argues, thrown into a flux of fast-paced technological development driven by neoliberal capitalism and advancing, most likely irreversible, climate change. This juncture, she adds hopefully, is also one from which new ways of knowing might emerge from the conjunc- tion of posthumanist and postanthropocentric approaches. Together, the en- vironmental humanities, new materialism, and the posthumanities demand a radical reconceptualization of the thick and knott…

of a more complex web of processes, and intensities, through an inter- relationality of differences and repetitions within experience and the material. This argument of the book will show how this occurs and is manifested through the filmic experience. Rosi Braidotti13 has referred to contemporary feminist philosophy as a practice of sexual difference and claims a `feminist female subject'. She explores the concept of the `nomadic subject' as a way to think about From Micro-politics to Aesthetics 19

have tended both to identify - in common with earlier thinkers - the position of 'otherness' with femininity, and to seek to occupy it. In this way, as Tania Modleski puts it, 'male power ... works to efface female subjectivity by occupying the site of femininity' (Feminism Without Women), and the material struggles of embodied women are erased. Modleski goes on to argue further that for women to seek to occupy the postmodernist position, as postmodernist feminists do, is a cause for considerable feminist concern. The kind of disembodied, 'anti- essentialist' feminism which is produced is, she argues, a luxury open only to the most privileged of women. Only those who have a sense of identity can play with not having it. How, then, can feminist theoryboth hold on to abelief in 'woman'and respect cultural diversityand difference? Or, as Rosi Braidotti puts it in Nomadic Subjects (1994), 'B…

choreographies that insist on the creativity of indigenous, local but also planetary and feminist ways of knowing. Whatever it touches, it transforms, re-purposes, and alters, borrowing like a magpie to build nests in high places. It brings the material consequences back with a vengeance, and it insists on the worldliness of thinking at large. Philosophy, art, and science stand here as corresponding con- cepts for the ability to enter into modes of relation (Braidotti 2017), to affect and be affected, sustaining qualitative shifts and creative tensions accordingly. Thinking is worldly practice, as pointed out by Stacey Alaimo. Thinking within the veins of feminist posthumanities also centers on a feminist ethic of relational- ity, care (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017), and difference (Braidotti 2006). Feminist posthumanities functions thus by what Braidotti has identiﬁed as a shrewd resis- ta…

with non-human others, which requires new politics, ethics and creative new cosmologies. She challenges specifically the long-standing association of females/non-Europeans with nature (Haraway 1990), stressing instead the need for feminist and anti-racist critiques that rest on a technologically mediated vision of a nature–culture continuum. She initiates a crossover dialogue between science and technology studies, race theory, socialist feminist politics and feminist neo-materialism by the figuration of the cyborg. A hybrid, or body-machine, the cyborg is a connection-making entity, a figure of inter-relationality, mobility, receptivity and global communication that deliberately blurs categorical distinctions (human/ non-human; nature/culture; male/female; Oedipal/non-Oedipal; European/ non-European). The cyborg as posthuman political subject exemplifies how Haraway combines c…

1 Reflections on Ethics, Destructiveness, and Life: Rosi Braidotti and the Posthuman Judith Butler Abstract This chapter engages with Rosi Braidotti’s affirmative ethical response to contemporary destructiveness and toxic forms. Braidotti’s notion of the posthuman, conceived as a dynamic amalgam of animal, machinic, technical, digital, organic, inorganic, viral, and capitalist dimensions, is considered as a welcome alternative to Agamben’s notion of bare life. Braidotti’s distinction between “sustainable” and “perverse” modalities is discussed in relation to what might be thought of as more than a simplistic opposition, challenging us to think of life in terms of intensities and becomings. Keywords Posthuman, destructiveness, affirmation, sustainability, transpositions It is a great honor to write a short piece on, and for, Rosi Braidotti on this occasion. I would like to take ad…

potentially invites. I want to do this in a way that is cognizant of the suggestion that a posthumanist feminist politics has been circulating in formats or arguments that extend the purview of the assumed contemporality of a posthumanist materialist account, as Braidotti (2015) amply points out in her genealogical analysis of posthuman feminism (see also Åsberg, 2017; Rossini, 2006, Kirby in McLoughlin, 2019). This is a posthumanism that has taken root in the style of inquiry that has been devoted, for some time, to understanding how a post-identitarian feminist agenda has operated via a problematization of the idea of “the human.” Originary Humanicity and Posthumanist Performativity Kirby and Barad follow different trajectories in their approaches to the human. However, the symmetry in these scholars’ work is apparent in their shared reference to what it is that the “quantum” details, …

option (unequal power relations must still be actively reconfigured). Braidotti argues that “the notion of relation emerges as the organizing principle to rethink the unity of the body in terms of the specificity of certain organic actualizations and the framing of levels of intensity such an entity is capable of sustaining” (2011c, p. 186). The consequential development of a full-blown “nomadic ethics” in what Braidotti herself calls “the trilogy” comprising Nomadic Subjects (1994i), Metamorphoses (2002j), and, lastly, Transpositions: On Nomadic Ethics (2006g), just like many of her institutional endeavors, is based on a feminist materialist theory of sexual differing that she recently summarized as follows: The point of nomadic subjectivity is to identify lines of flight, that is to say, a creative alternative space of becoming that would fall not between the mobile/ immobile, …

work of contemporary philosophers – including Jacques Rancière, Slavoj Zˇ izˇek and Judith Butler – in relation to the classical psychoanalytical posi- tions of Freud and Lacan. He looks at the philosophical questions that are now emerging from the productive convergence of philosophy and psychoanalysis: questions of sexuality, ideology and radical ethics, for instance. In her strongly contemporary chapter, ‘Feminist Philosophy’, Rosi Braidotti calls poststructuralism and deconstruction the ‘classical’ positions to which current feminist philosophy responds and seeks to move beyond. When the once-subversive has become mainstream, she argues, the challenge for feminist philosophy is to ﬁnd the ‘conceptual creativity’ to produce new forms of radicalism. Braidotti identiﬁes new paths in ‘post-anthropocentric’ vitalist philosophies of embodiment, ecology and biotechnology that have the poten…

and a conduit to resurrect the fear of the ‘Other’. Drawing on Rosi Braidotti’s (1993, 2003) analytic of the ‘nomadic subject’ and her cartographic meth- odology, this chapter thwarts the conceptualization of the Jihadi Bride as a unitary subject, instead reappraising her within advanced capitalism and fractured postmodern reality as a complex entity reconnecting her with her bodily subjectivity and suppressed pleasures. It re-centres her through the screen cultures of the post-digital landscape. This alternative reading releases her from the shackles of religiosity to recreate her as someone capable of experiencing and producing desire enmeshed with the consumption and ex- periential economies of the screen. In treating her as a postmodern and a post-digital subject, there is an acknowledgement that the feminine subject is neither an essentialized entity nor is it immediately accessible, casting it into

2 Simone Bignall and Rosi Braidotti materialist tradition of differential feminism that runs through ‘standpoint theory’, ‘situated knowledges’ and embedded, embodied nomadic subject­ ivity,3 stresses the importance of specific and accountable perspectives. This approach criticises the Eurocentric, masculinist universalism that is still operative in most knowledge production scientific systems, while pro­ posing robust alternatives. Perspectivism is at work in feminist theory, not as a form of fragmentation and relativism, but rather as the source of counter knowledges and alternative values. It offers a point of encounter and inter­ section with the highly defined forms of perspectivism currently formalised by Indigenous philosophy. We recognise, therefore, that contemporary posthuman and ecofeminist efforts to describe a mode of thought adequate to the complex material energie…

human and nonhuman, the material and immaterial, the social and physi- cal. Mori’s artistic production offers the most apparent engagement with capsules and encapsulation and thus serves as our central case study here. Ultimately, however, we will see that the capsule aesthetic is not restricted to Mori’s body of work. I propose that a capsule aesthetic unites the artistic instantiations of feminist materialisms examined throughout this book. The experiential and material artistic practices of Rist, Piccinini, and Mori all demonstrate a metaphorical capsule aesthetic in the distinctive ways they elaborate upon the mutual entanglements between humans and non- humans and the conditions of postanthropocentric posthumanism (Braidotti) more broadly. I begin by establishing a capsule aesthetic as it manifests in Mori’s new media art since approximately 1995. I conclude by articulating…

appear in such literature and the complexity involved in trying to develop a unifying ecofeminist postcolonial critique. Another extremely important “post-” in the development of ecofeminist literary theory and analysis is that of the “posthuman,” which Kerim Can Yazgünoğlu tackles in his chapter. He argues that posthuman thought exposes how anthropocentrism combined with speciesism works to imagine a human world separate from nature rather than fully imbricated in it. Key concepts of posthumanism for ecofeminism to address are “embodied subjects,” “posthuman bodies,” and “ecological genders.” A key aspect of ecofeminism to which posthumanist thought is indebted is that of the dismantling of Cartesian dualisms. Working with Rosi Braidotti’s critique of the “anthropos,” he shows how to develop that sort of posthuman feminism into a richer posthuman ecofeminism. Yazgünoğlu concludes by providing a posthuman ecofeminist reading of a novel and

Her comment suggests that feminism must take seriously and analyse critically the ‘choices’ and sexual practices of women within contemporary society if it is to progress and adapt its politics. In her work on Deleuze and nomadics, Rosi Braidotti argues that ‘becoming nomadic means you learn to reinvent yourself and you desire the self as a process of transformation. It’s about the desire for change, for flows and shifts of multiple desires. Deleuze is no Romantic. Deleuze’s nomadology stresses the need for a change of conceptual schemes alto- gether’ (2003, 53, author’s italics). What comes through post-feminist work and recent work within feminist film criticism is a desire to change the conceptual frameworks that have held ‘woman’ in place over the last thirty years. However, as Constable’s article illustrates so well, there is

and the innovative approaches of artists like Yayoi Kusama, Joseph Beuys, Judy Chicago, Sun Ra, and Carolee Schneemann had drastically redefined the boundaries of what being an artist could entail. Posthumanist thinking enters these conditions as an evolving instru- ment for artists whose practice aims to explore the possibility to rethink human/nonhuman relations in the context of modern imperial histories of settler colonialism and in the face of their irreparable environmental dev- astation. Among others, Ursula Biemann and Paulo Tavares’s collaboration with philosopher Rosi Braidotti, titled Forest Law is a startling example of new multidisciplinary practices that focus on the social, cosmopolitical, and legal implications of climate change through the voices of Indigenous political leaders narrating the aftermath of colonial exploitation that they continue to live with.

corpus. In a similar manner Rosi Braidotti rereads Deleuze in rela- tion to the postmodern. Deleuze is neither dismissed as one more sign of a postmodern malaise of dehumanisation. Nor is Deleuze celebrated as the harbinger of post-human cyber-liberation. Braidotti charts the conflicting possibilities for the future enabled by what her essay explores as the 'teratological' imaginary. Elizabeth Grosz, whose work on Deleuze and the body has already transformed feminism, now uses Deleuze to address the question of transformation itself. For Grosz, the issue presented by Deleuze has moved from the specificity of bodies and desires, to the movement of the virtual. Grosz's argument is not a straight- forward uncovering of a project or deep meaning in Deleuze's texts. Rather, Grosz weaves her own reading of Bergson back through Deleuze's use of Bergson to ask whether there might be a politics of the future. Given the ostensible demise of the emancipationist

The ‘thisness’ or haecceity of indi- vidual monsters or speciﬁc monstrous and gynaehorriﬁc expressions and conﬁgurations includes not only their aﬀective forms, but also ripples of the traumas from which they may originate or (re-)connect. As intermediaries between a past and a future, they oﬀer expressions or alternative bodies, sexualities, femininities, and modes of ‘being’ and becoming. Rosi Braidotti’s work on the rich, conceptual intersection of mothers, monsters and machines is instructive here, especially given her articulation of the analogous relationship between the female body and the monstrous (2011, 215; see also Shildrick 2002, 28–9). This is a relationship that operates at the levels of concept, political truth and corporeal designation, especially given the …

academic fields, and often joining forces with the prospects of “new materialism” (Bennett), “agential realism” (Barad) and “post-human feminism” (Haraway, Braidotti). Despite the many differences between the listed -isms a shared central premise seems to be the case: To cri- tique and subvert the long reign of anthropocentrism in theory, and to propose new ways of thinking about human-related issues from the perspectives of nonhuman forces, objects, factors, materialities and life forms (Harman 2009). To put it briefly: The nonhuman appears to be the shared interest of many of the cutting edge thinkers of our time. Or, as Saari and Mullen puts it: “We argue that Morton’s thoughts fur- ther the post-structuralist and new materialist critique of bounded, sta- ble places through introducing an ontology of finitude, withdrawal, and excess” (Saari and Mullen 2018).

Motivated by my concern with the urgent matter of the climate crisis and my claim about the eco-ethical dimensions of Fantastika, I read the mode with and through the material turn in contemporary philosophy. The material turn is a critical discourse that originates in work by Manuel de Landa (1995) and Rosi Braidotti (2002) and seeks to dismantle transcendental and humanist modes of thought, themselves an outgrowth of philosophical dualism, which these thinkers claim haunts cultural theory in the West. Braidotti’s elaboration of neo-materialism is most significant for the present book since my reading of Fantastika grows out of my previous work on nomadism, which, via Braidotti, identifies Deleuze and Guattari’s notion of ‘becoming’ as key to the subjectivities explored and imagined in children’s gothic (Germaine Buckley 2018: 6–13). The material turn recasts nomadic becoming…

a world’,” which we share with animals because “we ourselves are human animals” (Wolfe 2010, xxv). Braidotti’s “critical posthumanities” are also constructed upon an ontology of “the radical immanence, i.e. the primacy of intelligent and self-organizing matter,” whose posthuman subject is described as “relational, embodied and embedded,” on the basis of the claim of a continuity between body and mind, nature and culture (2019, 1). It is within the reframing of animal studies by the posthuman turn, subsuming in itself the affective and material turns of the new ecocrit- icisms, that I want to locate the analysis of my case study. Because I have also, always, been interested in literature and the literary, and in a formal, or aesthetic approach to it, the aim I have set myself for this article is to investigate how a literary work could contribute not only to that radical change in our thinking about the world—and our place in

(cf. Zizek 1992; Rushton 2011), or a turn to a post-linguistic materialism. Also described as ‘new feminist materialism’, Iris Van der Tuin deﬁnes as three pathways for this re-turn to materialist modeling. She notes that this movement investigates (i) ‘the posthumanist theorization of agential matter’; (ii) ‘the theoretical impetus of biopolitics and bioethics (“political matters”)’; and (iii) a ‘non-linear take on political economy (2011: 6). The contemporary interest in the posthuman and the non-human model resonates with the post-media theorisation of the mediation of technology (see Hayles 1999; Winthrop-Young et al. 2013); and theoreti- cal work on world cinemas, post-colonial, decolonial, queer and feminist ﬁlm investigates the second and third area that Van der Tuin identiﬁes (cf. hooks 1996; Rony 1996; Projansky 2001; Aaron 2004; Williams 2008).

Accounting adequately for changes is a challenge that shakes up long- established habits of thought.

More ethical courage is also needed and deeper theoretical eff orts to sustain the qualitative shift of per- spective that may help us confront the complexities of our era (see chapter 7, “Postsecular Paradoxes”).

Chapter 5 Posthumanism On ‘Posthuman Humanism’ by Rosi Braidotti (2013) Rosi Braidotti has been described – and described herself – as a New Materi- alist. The standpoint could be deﬁned as of one who is philosophically a monist (Braidotti uses the adjective ‘monistic’ at several points through her text here1) and rejects the long-ingrained Western habit of dualist thought of the types material versus mind, subject versus object, nature versus culture, and so on. In fact, it is probably a position she shares with most, if not all, of the con- temporary essay writers discussed here, with Karen Barad and Denise Ferreira da Silva perhaps the most notable for their intellectual presentation of the case for material and against dualism. Of course, the rejection of transcendentalism and dualism is not a new thing in western thought, and has featured strongly and historically in the work of Heraclitus, Spinoza, Hume, Nietzsche and

32 Rosi Braidotti and Rick Dolphijn specific concerns. Nomadic feminism is about tracing a zigzagging path between them. Becoming-minority is a task also for the minorities, who all too often tend to be caught in the paralyzing gaze of the master – hating him/her and envying him/her at the same time. It is about activating different counter- memories and actualizing multiple ecologies of belonging. Becoming nomadic means one learns to re-invent oneself and one desires the self as a process of transformation. It’s about the desire for change, for flows and shifts of multiple desires. Nomadic theory rests on a non-unitary yet politically engaged and ethically accountable vision of the nomadic subject. Nomadic thought stresses the need for a change of conceptual schemes altogether, an overcoming of the Dialectic of Majority/Minority or Master/Slave as the Hegelians propose.…

nals, and she-wolves are symbolic exhibitions of internal and external affec- tations. Deviating from the immaterial of poststructuralism, this complicates theories of meaning, by thinking about the intricacies and formation of the body and its behaviors, while recognizing and transgressing such borders and limitations. Since poststructuralism concentrates on the fluidity of language and the structure of meaning to explain the social world, Braidotti interjects a material mapping as the source of meaning. Utilizing these figurations of embodied subjectivity, the unpredictable form is substituted in place of immaterial discourse. As mappings of embodied and embedded subjectivi- ties, these depictions of monstrosity figure the violence enacted on women, thus presenting a transformative exhibition of repression. As beings of what Braidotti (2003, 5) labels “enfleshed or embodied ma…

each other. For example, human-animal studies, medical humanities, and environ- mental or ecological humanities (Squier 2004; Alaimo 2011; Rose et al. 2012; Rose 2015), as well as new media and digital humanities (as presented by Holloway- Attaway in this volume), have all generated new forms of posthumanities. They may thus engender feminist cultural studies with a transbiological twist or ecologically embedded ethics (Alaimo 2008). They may encompass human-animal perspectives in technoscience, marine life in musicology, or the ethnography of southern women’s stitching technologies. In all cases feminist posthumanities means reaching out, becoming (k)nomadic (Cieleme˛cka 2015), and composing with others a missing population, standing like modest witnesses on the shoulders of giants, aiming to become accountable companions to troubled and rich intellectual heritages. It also involves cri…

Nomadic Theory as an Epistemology for Transnational Feminist History 201 To quote Braidotti again, the politics of location are “cartographies of power that rest on a form of self-criticism, a critical, genealogical self-narrative; they are relational and outside directed. This means that ‘embodied’ accounts illuminate and transform our knowledge of ourselves and of the world” (Braidotti 2011a, p. 16). When starting to research women’s and feminist history in the Balkans in the mid- 2000s, I was confronted with Eurocentric assumptions and Orientalist discourses that had proliferated in Western media since the Yugoslav wars. I was also faced with my own privileged mobility as a EU citizen, at a time when Schengen visa liberalizations for former Yugoslav citizens were still to become a reality. The women from Belgrade, Zagreb, and Sarajevo I interviewed, mostly second wave feminists…

the critique of power relations (i.e. media, archives, entrenched nostalgia) along with an engagement with sustainable alternatives. For Rosi Braidotti (2003: 43–44), the redefinition of the female subject begins through the bodily roots of subjectivity while emphasizing the po- litical importance of desire and of its role in the constitution of the subject. From this perspective, the subject of feminism is simultaneously sexed and social. Braidotti posits the body, or the embodiment of the subject, as a key term in the feminist struggle for the redefinition of subjectivity. It is to be understood as neither a biological nor a sociological category, but rather as a point of overlap between the physical, the symbolic and the material social conditions (Grosz 1987; Braidotti 1989). Drawing on Braidotti, the counter-images of the Jihadi Bride are utilized as a means to reconfigure the politically informed maps of the present (i.e. cartography). It invokes

used as a normative tool to ensure conformity to and coherence in the bour- geois social model. The work of trans activist and writer Paul B. Preciado is in many ways the embodiment of progress in work pioneered by Butler in expanding the concepts and realities of the gendered subject far beyond merely binary possibilities. Meanwhile much work has been done in reworking the notion of subject to include the non-human and understand their role in the production of knowledge: Anna Tsing is inspired by the work of Donna Haraway to look at interspecies interdependency without which the human cannot survive – and indeed Rosi Braidotti here in her piece on posthumanism even projects through at one point to a world where the human is already extinct (the transhuman). As regards the implicit Eurocentricity and whiteness of the ‘traditional’ model of the subject, de Sousa Santos shows how Western 18 Introduction

subject to be multilayered, and mechanise the sideways movement and mutation of embodied subjectivity, referred to by Rosi Braidotti in the epigraph to this introduction. In seeking innovative and creative ways to read these dynamics of female corporeality, this book turns to the philosophy of Deleuze, and to his collaborations with Félix Guattari. As we shall see, articulations of corporeality in the work of these writers hold great resonance with a Deleuzian vocabulary, one that invokes flux, mobility, geography, surface and aleatory connection. Navigating such a theoretical frame- work will not be without some critical risk. Deleuze has often been criticised for taking a masculinist approach to philosophical endeavour, for obscuring the body and feminine specificity. Nonetheless, this book will maintain that his philosophy is of increasing relevance to feminist concerns and to thinking about the dynamism of the female body. On

as a decentring, mobility and rigidity, inherent violence and propensity to self-destruction as a system. Here the linear gives way to the contradic- tory, particularly in terms of the homogenization of commodity culture where consumer practices conjoin with disparities and structural inequal- ities. Pluralism and racialized stereotypes coexist. Our world is embedded and supported by a major technological revolution producing counter-­ memories against the grain of the dominant representations of subjectivity. The recognition of an existing cartography and its critique as well as the quest to map alternatives signals a shift away from anthropocentrism. The subject is then produced through an entanglement of material, bio-cultural and symbolic forces (Braidotti 2004). For Braidotti (2004) bodies collapse into an interdependent bind with technology symbolized by the cyborg’s techno-body saturated by a complex web of dynamic and technologically

SubStance #112, Vol. 36, no. 1, 2007 113 The Becoming Trans-Feminist of (Post-) Marxism post-feminist identities are not fixed, congealed identities; rather, they are shifting identities—Teresa de Lauretis’s eccentric subjects, Rosi Braidotti’s nomadic subjects, the hybrid, mestiza, negotiated identities of the young migrant women of the second generation of whom Nirmal Puwar speaks (19). They are Donna Haraway’s fractured, cyborg identities, the deviant identities of queer theory, Judith Butler’s non- natural, non-ontological, constructed identities, post-national, post- gender and post-identitarian identities. Thus, writes Marie-Hélène Bourcier apropos of queer practices, “Some practice politics of differences, others politics of the multitudes, but what is certain is the fact that queer thought and practices are located on the side of the multiplication of identities and post-identities, indeed on the side of the mechanisms for

What explains the importance of this feminist lineage within posthumanism is that it was feminism that challenged humanism’s track record in terms of gender (and racial) equality, countering its claim of a universal reach (i.e., an essential “humanity” based on globally shared values). The ideal subject of humanism, “man” or “anthropos,” was alwa…

Feminist Philosophy 10 Rosi Braidotti In spite of regular reports about the end of feminism as a social movement, at the start of the third millennium feminist philosophy is going through an astonishing period of renewal and growth. The diversiﬁcation and expan- sion of feminist philosophies, fuelled by a brand new generation of post- postfeminists, is both supported by and productive of a signiﬁcant growth of institutional practices, some of which happen outside the strict conﬁnes of academic philosophy, mostly in new trans-disciplinary areas like gender, race and postcolonial studies, social theories of globalization and migration, and philosophies of new media and biotechnology. This theoretical vitality raises a range of methodological questions about the uses and the limitations of interdisciplinarity in feminist philosophy and more speciﬁcally about the criteria of classiﬁcation, t…

3 Introduction read Rosi Braidotti’s Patterns of Dissonance nearly twenty years ago, and was transported then by her certainty that passion was the point of theory, and that without that passion, feminist theory could have no real value (1991). I have always loved feminist theory for its utopianism, and I hope to contribute to the tradition of dogged optimism that allows its practi- tioners to understand and experience life differently. In this spirit, there are three overlapping strands to this work, all of which seek to allow for a different kind of feminist political thinking: the laying out of Western feminist storytelling in this intellectual space I call home; the exploration of the political grammar of feminist narratives that make up these stories and their consistency with other stories about feminism and gender; the sketching out of interventions that start at the level of political grammar and propose ways of breaking open dominant narrative forms. Of these

Jacques Derrida, “The Double Session,” in Dissemination , trans. Barbara Johnson (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), 206. 2. In her own reading of “becoming-woman” in terms of Irigaray’s “sen- sible transcendental,” Rosi Braidotti enlists the monstrous feminine in mapping out a ﬁ guration of multiple becomings. In tracing the ways in which the femi- nine is posited as the Other in the techno-teratological social imaginary of the late postindustrial Western postmodernity, she unravels how the multiple patterns of feminized monstrous becoming overthrow humanistic axioms of representa- tion.

I will also off er readings of some of the more striking aspects of contemporary politi- cal culture, especially the powerful lure of neonationalism and Euro-centric xenophobia (part 3 “Nomadic Citizenship”). The logic of this sequence is partly chronological, building up from earlier to more recent essays, partly conceptual. The book builds up gradually to a political punch line, and the movement ﬂ ows from more critical pieces to more affi rmative ones, as if to demonstrate the necessity of a practice of affi rmation. Of course it is my hope that readers may open the book at any on…

continue to structure many women’s, indeed most people’s, lives, when the material costs of overcoming the friction of distance are beyond their means. However, the new technologies that compress distance and reduce friction for capitalist enterprises also open up increasing possibilities for interaction between imagined communities or communities of interest. While these communities may be spatially distant, there are greater prospects than ever before of building coali- tions between them. As Rosi Braidotti (1994) reminds us, this new international politics of coalition raises key questions for feminist scholars in the ‘centre’, in the metropolises of the industrial West where migrant women constitute the bulk of what she terms ‘domes- tic foreigners’. ‘When’, Braidotti asks, will we accept that internationalization begins at home? How close are we, the ‘white’ intellectual women, to t…

whether it be because of human beings or because of nature’ (Faria 2014: 234). One strategy for overcoming this problem is Rosi Braidotti’s zoe-centrism, focused on the principle that ‘the relational capacity of the posthuman subject is not confined within our species, but it includes all nonanthropomorphic elements, starting from the air we breathe. Living matter – including embodied human flesh – is intelligent and self-organizing’ (2017: 33). The core problem is precisely this ‘posthu- man subject’: ‘we may yet overcome anthropocentrism by becoming anthropomorphic bodies without organs that are still finding out what they are capable of becoming’ (Braidotti 2017: 35). It remains to be seen just how ‘subjectivised’ such a body could be, since the ‘subject’

and post-humanists redeﬁned the ideal of a female body as one that transcends binaries and embraces artiﬁciality through ﬁction. Although this book does not insist that the above narratives about the female body in representation are either correct or comprehensive, it uses them as a provisional framework for the analysis of contemporary art, and raises questions about them that are kept in suspension. Both narratives have three themes in common: power, idealism and ambiguity. In the ﬁrst, the themes are positively aligned, since both idealism and ambiguity service the demands of capitalist power. In the second, where the alliance between patriarchal, capitalist power and idealism is under attack by feminists, ambiguity is foregrounded. This ambiguity renders uncertain the status of feminist art production as a counternarrative and it risks pushing the art towards either morbidity or uto…

7 Introduction subjects of knowledge – embedded, embodied and yet flowing in a web of relations with humans and nonhuman others’ (2018: 34). In this way, Braidotti’s neo-materialism seeks to solve the apparent paradox of posthumanism: the simultaneous disappearance and over exposure of the human. This paradox is not simply a theoretical conundrum; it has taken on material urgency in the contemporary climate crisis, which has been unequivocally caused by human actions yet has unleashed events and processes occurring at a scale and level of complexity that utterly rupture the fallacy of human transcendence from ‘nature’ and our exceptionalism. The material turn encompasses a variety of approaches, all of which share a rejection of philosophical dualism. Serenella Iovino and Serpil Opperman summarize the material turn as comprising myriad new ‘ways to analyse language, and realit…

The es- says in this anthology are a ﬁrst step toward not just articulating these theories but integrating them into what amounts to a new paradigm for feminist thought. It is our thesis that this paradigm is currently emerging and that it is a necessary and exhilarating move for contem- porary feminism. While this volume brings together some of the most thought-provoking and innovative theorists of the new “material femi- nism,” no single volume can hope to represent every point of emer- gence; thus, this volume should be read in dialogue with the work of Luce Irigaray, Rosi Braidotti, Myra J.

imposed both from within and from the wider world beyond. This, she says, has led to a heterogeneous abundance of methodologies, approaches and dis- courses. Despite the apparent displacement and outrunning of the Humanities by the daily realities of advanced global capitalism however, she remains posi- tive (as, incidentally, were both Fanon and Said for an extra-European renewal of the Humanities), and sees the use of new resources for the disciplines, citing exploitation of new media and technology and scholarship in innovative ﬁelds like animal studies and eco-criticism. This multiplicity and non-uniﬁed direc- tion of the Humanities can no longer be organised around philosophy as the heart and master theory which judges truths and neither can the human be the unique subject of the posthuman Humanities, far less with ‘Man’ as that exclusive, universalist European rationalist with his dead certainties. As Braidotti puts it:

important though that these are. ‘New materialisms’ are necessarily pluralised, and throughout this book I consider Woolf’s wide-ranging reconceptualisation of the mate- rial world alongside various nuanced contemporary materialist theories. I begin in Chapter 1 with Woolf’s own theory of ‘granite and rainbow’ which, I argue, is entangled in a vibrant, multiple and creative engage- ment with, and conceptualisation of, the material world. The subsequent chapters go on to consider Braidotti’s materialist nomadic feminism in relation to A Room of One’s Own and To the Lighthouse (1927), Braidotti’s ‘polymorphous vitalism’ and Colebrook’s ‘queer vitalism’ alongside Orlando (1928), Haraway’s ‘mud philosophy’ and Flush (1933), and Barad’s quantum-inspired, material-discursive ‘intra-action’ alongside Bennett’s theory of ‘vital materialism’ in relation to The Waves (1931).

that the relations will become complex and even oppositional. The increas- ing fragmentation of the categories of gender, class, race, sexuality, eth- nicity, and religion challenge easy coalitions and the privileging of singular political identities, including that of ‘woman’ or even ‘feminist’. At the same time, such de-centering offers fresh possibilities for political alignments and furthers a reconceptualization of the multiple sites of feminism. This issue of boundary 2, as a whole, seeks to map the boundaries between postmod- ernism and feminism, while it envisions a new terrain for their crossing in a materialist feminist politics. Feminist materialist thought requires a geocultural reorientation as well, and it is to supply this that our particular admixture of feminism and postmodernism is shaken and bottled as a special issue of boundary 2.

cultural frameworks surrounding female subjectivity and sexuality. It is this process of interrogation and deconstruction that functions to germinate the ethical potential of an exploration of female masochism culturally and philosophically. Value-laden terminology surrounds the masochistic body and the female body alike: these bodies are perverse and taboo, monstrous and obscene, transgressive phenomenon that appear in the consciousness of society to thwart or demolish any stable notions of propriety or normality in regard to the socially situated human subject. Rosi Braidotti is one of a number of recent theorists who have engaged with the concept of the post-human in order to demonstrate not that the category of the human is transforming in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century but that the very concept of the human as expressed in the doctrines of Western Human…

poses and thus dismantles the feminine/​masculine binary, these texts present us with the posthuman in its ability to give the weak and disabled body more power, (as with Melkumova-Reynolds, Guerrero and Rodriguez, and Braid, and to a lesser degree Vester and Muzaffar) or in its ability to present itself as a stronger and/​or more desirable one (as with Pilińska, Śmieja and Woolley), and by relation, its ability to ‘drag’ as per Judith Butler. The general feel of most of these texts is, as with most posthuman studies, not a lamentation for the loss of the human, but rather, almost, a celebration of this posthuman status, especially in relation to the female body. Vester’s anal­ ysis of femininity as a superpower speaks highly to that, but so does Braid’s

ative life. Zoe allows for an a‹rmative appreciation of life. Braidotti extensively traces the history of “life as zoe” in philosophy and goes on to develop the concept of a sustainable self. She embraces the ethical principle of a‹rmation by putting forward what she calls a “sustainable nomadic ethics.” The concept of nomadism points to an understanding of the self and of the subject as a dynamic process of continuous becoming. In order for that nomadic self to be sustainable, Braidotti argues, the subject needs endurance. Endurance, for her, is joyful a‹rmation as the inherently positive potential of the subject. Thus Braidotti develops a new ﬁgura- tion of living subjectivities in the posthumanist mode. Bits of Life highlights the search for tools and theories by which it becomes pos- sible to analyze the complex interplay among textual, visual, imaginary, techno- logical, and biological dimensions of bodies, of subjects, and of life.

project. — Rosi Braidotti (1994, 37-38) This essay is situated at the intersection of two trajectories of critical thought: feminism and post-workerism. In the displacements brought about by feminism, it seeks to grasp the need to rethink the categories of the critique of political economy. The feminism to which I am referring here is essentially that which reconfigured itself following its confrontation with the homosexual and post-colonial movements—a feminism that I will call transfeminism, using a term borrowed from Beatriz Preciado—that is, a feminism that is a thinking of and a political experimenting with multiplicity. I am joining the other trajectory, post- workerism, essentially at the level of the developments that have resulted from the contributions of Maurizio Lazzarato, Christian Marazzi, Yann Moulier Boutang, Antonio Negri and Carlo Vercellone over the past dozen years—their effort to rethink labor, social cooperation, the wage and

of how, in Braidotti's words in Nomadic Subjects, to 'figure out how to respect cultural diversity without falling into relativism or political despair'. The 'situatedness' envisaged here, however, isno simple affair. It is in the first place a position which insists on the embodied and therefore sexually differentiated nature of the female subject. But embodiment does not, in this context, mean 'essentialism', where essentialism is defined as implying a fixed and monolithic essence to female identity "which is beyond historical and cultural change. The embodied female subject envisaged here is, on the contrary, a 'nomadic' subject, to use Braidotti's terminology. That is, she is 'the site of multiple, complex, and potentially contradictory sets of experiences, defined by overlapping variables such as class, race, age, lifestyle, sexual preference, and others'. Haraway goes further: in t…

It makes feminism complicitous with the aims of advanced capitalism and its belligerent economy.

ture’. This binary division is not a benign separation but is value-laden, inscribing value to one (i.e., culture) and ‘denigrating’ the other (i.e., nature). Neimanis writes that this nature/culture distinction is not a refer- ence to discrete entities alone but has come to stand in for a whole host of representa- tional practices and relations whereby asso- ciations with ‘culture’ indicate ‘masculin- ity’, ‘western’ and ‘cosmopolitan ways of life’, while ‘nature’ is used to denote asso- ciational links with ‘femininity’, primi- tiveneness and backward, non-progressive world views and life worlds. Neimanis pro- vides a ‘schematization’ of the ‘various feminist positions’, outlines a ‘detailed evaluation of “new materialist” positions on nature/culture’ and argues that if feminist theory is to realize a much more expansive idea of ethical and political accountability then it must bring in as part of its commit- ment to intersectional analyses not only

of bodies and matter (see chapter 5, “Matter-Realist Feminism”). Feminism is the social and theoretical movement that, more than any other, expressed a double-edged vision that combined creativity with cri- tique. Although it is critical in political orientation, feminist nomadic thought is never negative; on the contrary, it makes an explicit case for af- ﬁ rmative politics. The ongoing processes of transformation require alterna- tive ﬁ gurations to express the kind of internally contradictory multifaceted subjects we have become. There is a noticeable gap between how we live—in emancipated or postfeminist, multiethnic global societies, with high tech- nologies and telecommunication, allegedly free borders, and increased se- curity controls as well as a state of warfare—and how we represent to our- selves this lived familiarity. This belies an imaginative poverty that can be par…

to unpaid reproductive labor in the era of structural adjustment. In ‘‘Always on Display: A√ective Production in the Modeling Industry,’’ Elizabeth Wissinger focuses on the work of fashion models. Arguing that understanding the body in terms of a√ective capacities proves a more e√ective model for researching postmodern bodies, Wissinger traces links between the growth of imaging technologies, the growth of the modeling industry, and increased investment in the means of modulating a√ective ﬂow between bodies. Wissinger points to the socialization of a√ect or a√ective capacity in late-twentieth-century capitalism as a way to think beyond the subjectivist bent of traditional critiques of con- sumer culture. Melissa Ditmore’s ‘‘In Calcutta, Sex Workers Organize’’ takes up labor in an a√ective economy in order to understand prostitution as sex work and to argue that abuses connected to prostitution and tra≈cking, which policy

exceed it (Grant 2009). The thinkers who could be loosely described as “new materialists” are far less concerned than the speculative realists are with the particular paradoxes of correlationism. But they also seek to elaborate new ways of grasping the world, outside of anthropocentric paradigms and grounded in a firm commitment to realism (for a survey of the various new materialisms, see Coole and Frost 2010 and Dolphijn and van der Tuin 2012). Most of the new materialists are strongly influenced (as Graham Harman is also) by the work of Bruno Latour. They take inspiration from the way that Latour traces the power struggles and negotiations of nonhuman as well as human actants (Latour 1988, 151–238) and envisions a world of proliferating hybrids (Latour 1993, 1–3 and passim). Thus Jane Bennett champions a “vital materialism” in which things exhibit “a positive, productive power of their own” (2010, 1 and passim). Rosi Braidotti similarly explores the

theoretical materialisms inaugurated by feminist scholars of technosci- ence, including Karen Barad, Donna Haraway, Rosi Braidotti, N. Katherine Hayles, Elizabeth Grosz, and others, offer timely critical perspectives about how our contemporary sciences and technologies create us even as we cre- ate them. We have seen that experiential, material art practices are excep- tional among the feminist new materialisms in that they draw attention to our interactions with science and technology as lived experiences in real space. Rather than working primarily with words, artists like Rist, Picci- nini, and Mori work with materials and through bodies; their installations allow us to experience and inhabit embodied technointerfaces ﬁrsthand. We have also seen how these post- 1990 artists mine the inheritance of a range of feminist media art practices and critical spectatorship theories from …

Finally, I organized several group discussions with members of the collective concerning the history of the book’s transformation within and outside the United States.19 The second phase of the inquiry involved an in-depth analysis of OBOS as a feminist epistemological project—that is, a project that is involved in generating feminist knowledge and knowledge practices. It began with a confrontation between the epistemological assump- tions of OBOS and postmodern feminist body theory (in particu- lar, the work of Donna Haraway, Judith Butler, Elizabeth Grosz, Joan Scott, and Susan Bordo), as well as alternative biological, phenome- nological, and materialist critiques of this theory.20 I show how OBOS can contribute to some of the most central discussions in feminist body theory by providing an embodied, situated, critical feminist politics of knowledge.

The central role of sex has grounded many strands of feminism in new forms of materialism. As Rosi Braidotti argues, there are two main types of feminist materialisms. A focus on embodiment develops the transversal of bodies and power. This led to a sensitivity to the entwining of body and mind, nature and culture (Dolphijn and van der Tuin 2012: 21). Another consequence is that

relevant to Fern’s life and its radical underpinnings. Being a nomad involves living a life on the move, a refusal to be tied down or deﬁned by set deﬁnitions. The nomad desires to discover new things, to grow and set forth on ‘a creative line of ﬂight’. The female protagonist who undergoes this journey can be understood in terms of Deleuze’s nomadic subject in that she is a marginal and marginalised ﬁgure. Rosi Braidotti sees the nomad as embarking on a journey that has the potential to lead to change ‘that destabilizes all identities’. Such destabilisation is central to the journey of the female protagonist of Feminist New Wave Cinema. In other words, the nomadic subject signiﬁes the potential becoming, the opening out—the transformative power of all the exploited, marginalized, 80 The Monstrous-Feminine Forgets Her Manners

in terms of reproduction. By interrogating biotechnical, bacterial, parthenogenic (genital-­less), biodigital and machinic sex, she is able to articulate a theory of abstract sex as that which is (re)productive without being genital. Such sex escapes the Cartesian mind–body dualism, the Oedipal economy of desire and pleasure, as well as the division in cyberculture between essentialist nature and constructivist culture. The benefit of such an approach, apart from correspond- ing more closely to biophysical, biocultural and biodigital reality, is that it recognises the body as a mutating force and emphasises its ‘thousand modes of sex and reproduction’ (Parisi 2004: 197). Parisi’s project, heavily influenced by Spinoza as well as by Deleuze and Guattari, thus opens for ways of rethinking what bodies are and what they can do, and indeed, she argues herself, for acknowledging ‘new cultures and new species’ and ‘the proliferation of a new nature

variety of disciplines including quantum physics, biology, feminism, phe­ nomenology, post-structuralism, and post-Marxism. According to Rick Dolphijn and Iris van der Tuin, authors of New Materialism: Interviews and Cartographies, new materialism has been gaining traction since the late 1990s (Dolphijn and van der Tuin 2012, 13). Coined separately by Rosi Braidotti and Manuel DeLanda, new materialism (or neo-­materialism) stresses “the concrete yet complex materiality of bodies immersed in social relations of power” (Dolphijn and van der Tuin 2012, 21). Focusing heav­ ily on feminist issues of embodiment, Dolphijn and van der Tuin work to extend discussions of bodies beyond the human context. That is, the bod­ ies at stake in new materialisms are not limited to human bodies, but include nonhuman animals, plants, rocks, weather patterns, computers, and throw rugs. In one of the interviews conducted by Dolphijn and van der Tuin,
