Merleau-Ponty claims that, in perceiving things, I sense that they could be more clearly perceived and my body is drawn to get a firmer grip on them: My body is geared to the world when my perception offers me a spectacle as varied and as clearly articulated as possible, and when my motor intentions, as they unfold, receive from the world the responses they anticipate. This maximum distinctness in perception and action defines a perceptual ground, a basis of my life, a general milieu for the coexist- ence of my body and the world.2 In Todes’s terms, our perception of the things around us is a response to our dissatisfaction with our lostness in the world.

To the contrary, such changeability shows that what Butler calls \"enabling disruptions\" (23) can occur at a variety of shifting sitesin bodies, in language, in the social fabric. The very recognition of the body's volatility may well have derived from the engagement with body writing and its release of an unsettling somatic language. If so, then feminist efforts to write the body have loosened the ground, as it were, thus facilitating many of the productive destabilizations and disruptions of normative thought that have shaken intellectual traditions in recent years. And so I turn now to the specific and changing bodies that have come to proliferate within feminist theory. These \"tongue-like forms\" and \"big red mouths\" move language, with bod…",

The editors of The Affect Theory Reader identify as central to the theory a drive to recognize the constant modulations of affective states and in the process to produce “an inventory of shimmers,” to assemble a more com- plete picture of life lived moment by moment (Seigworth and Gregg 2010). As choice of the term “inventory” indicates, in the first instance this project has largely been one of description, of bringing in from the cold phenomena left out of standard accounts of experience. Certainly until very recently, the main push across many disciplines has been to dem- onstrate the need to attend to affect if we are to access an ontology that recognizes the relational quality of the bond between subject and object, human and non-human, animate and inanimate, material and immaterial.

Today, the verdict is less damning and the possibility of late treatment is clearly supported and implemented. In L’Age et le principe de plaisir, Le Gouès returns to Freud’s dual articulation of the concept of plasticity, namely, the indestructibility of psychic life and the tenacity of libidinal investments. He demonstrates that the ageing subject tries to compensate for the natural weakening of libidinal investments through an uncon­ scious emphasis on psychic life, marked by a return to infantile psychic forms. Supposedly the older person returns to the solipsism and egotism of the child. Libidi­ nal weakening is accompanied by a reinforcement of the partial pre-genital drives and a narcissistic withdrawal. Ferenczi too noticed this, as he explains: “Older people become child-like again, narcissistic, losing many of their",

Transcendence above mere bodily functions is the mark of true humanity, she contends; but women are too likely to be stuck in immanence, bound by bodily dictates through reproduction. ‘Biology’ is thus passive and limiting in at least some of de Beauvoir's work, yet paradoxically active in the sense that women's reproductive organs seem to ‘have a life of their own'. De Beauvoir's vision of the body is problematic partly because she relies on an additive model of the relationship between ‘biology’ and social experience. I have criticised additive narratives in detail elsewhere (Birke 1986, 1992); put briefly, these are accounts which imply that there is a biological bedrock onto which experience and environments write. Feminism cannot hope to change the bedrock, but we can concentrate on challenging the political system which structures ex…",

The breaking of the chalk at the board was both an articulation of how I was feeling (“pressured at the board”) and a potential solution to the pressure I was experiencing: “if I'm incompetent then I won't have to teach!” The unconscious recreated a harmony with the real by giving content to the enigmatic gaze of my students through the symptom of breaking the chalk. The gap functions in a very specific way in Lacan's conception of the mechanisms of the unconscious, but we can say that Lacan also makes a broader and more profound point about the gap and the relationship between cause and effect that holds for all inter- object relations.

This description is highly reminiscent of Leigh’s Sleeping Beauty, and indeed Sontag identifies in pornographic literature a similar problematic of objectification to that which is emphasized in Leigh’s film. In such cases it is difficult to see how the spaces of perversion could provide the possibility of an ethical restructuring; however, these emplacements are arguably not representative of the heterocosmic impulse but merely depict exaggerated replications of the dominant structure that exists in society as a whole. Silverman argues that the masochistic drive specifically (found in texts such as Venus in Furs), rather than the pornographic or perverse as a more general urge, hold the power to overturn one fundamental aspect of the symbolic order: within the masochistic narrative, the paternal law (or…",

In other words, her writing always refers to other texts or discourses, not to a non-discursive or 'real' corporeality, experience or pleasure. It is an active, creative coding or inscription, a positive marking of women's bodies, which may produce a female body whose sexuality is lived in other, different terms than the limiting possibilities available to women in patri- archy. In her understanding, patriarchal knowledges represent (male) sexuality by a solidity, stability and identity congruent with the kind of identity constructed for the boy by his oedipus complex. Her aim is to reveal the fluidity, the polymorphous multiplicity of the pre-oedipal which underlies and precedes it.

The volume is divided into three parts: The Concept of the Posthuman, The Politics of the Academic, and The Ethics of the Nomad, reflecting simultaneously Braidotti’s personal engagements and trajectories and her thinking and conceptual developments. However, upon reading it, it will soon become apparent that the three parts are all shot through with the politics of disciplinary positioning and traditions of how to think and understand, particularly, the (post)human in theories of Philosophy, Anthropology, STS, and Film Studies to name but a few. Moreover, they are all informed by the crisscrossing concepts and practices of generations, memories, writing, and activism. Thus, the three parts are not stable and distinct categories and the reader is invited to travel her own route…",

The resistance of the completely powerless Other is perhaps paradoxically the most powerful form that resistance can take. Levinas’s writings on the face of the Other and Derrida’s meditations on the relevance of death to ethics are signs of the ethical turn in Continental philosophy that occurs in the 1980s and the 1990s. This ethical turn may well have been a result of criticisms of poststructuralism for being at least inattentive to and at worst unable to explain normative issues. If there is to be a deconstructive genealogy, it must provide at least some examples of how it understands itself in relation to ethics. Chapter 5 explores poststructuralism’s abstention from critical theory’s use of both the method…",

To further explore this disarticulation between the subject and the world, as well as the viewer and the artwork, art historians have turned to Emmanuel Levinas’ understanding of ethics, particularly the paradigmatic encounter of the ‘face-to-face’ which he describes in Totality and Inﬁnity. For Levinas, the subject is constituted as a response to the other’s appeal or demand for recognition. Essentially, the other calls the subject into being – an imperative for the subject to differentiate itself. The other’s command is the initial moment that the subject recognizes the other’s irreducibility to her or himself. For Levinas, this recogni- tion deﬁnes ethics: the subject is constituted as a fundamental acknowledgement of the other. The subject is therefore founded upon her or his ethical response – a confrontation with the alterity of the other, which Lev…",

Here it is enough to observe that Locke's proposal for semiotic, once seen against the backdrop of Poinsot's Tractatus de Signis, surely appears as one of history's confluences within the Zeitgeist of the seventeenth century, revealing as it does that the very problem exercising modern thought in its rejection of Latin immersion in Aristotelian philosophy of nature was the problem on which Poinsot brought all the resources of Latin tradition to bear, namely, the problem, as Locke put it,122 of \"the way and proportion that objects are suited to",

The female character is passive; the transitivity choices are of particular types, and this has some impact on the fact that the woman is represented as passive. We would then go on to argue that this is a general case for representations of women as a whole, and perhaps demand that this situation change.

Since Mulvey confined her argument to cinema, to second-hand mediated gazing at images on a flat screen, it seems ahistorical and myopic to treat her account of gazing (as we often do now) as all-encompassing or paradigmatic, as unequivocally applicable to gazing at printed and painted images of women and to unmediated, direct, three-dimensional, “real-time,” in the flesh gazing.

The complications and limitations as well as the possibilities and stratagems of this contradictory position will I hope become clear as the successive readings of essentialism unfold. Perhaps it only needs final emphasizing at this point that the project of interrogating essence wherever we may find it does not necessarily entail simultaneously dismissing it.

Together, this means, ﬁrst, that we are always leaving the immediate milieu behind, and second, that when we turn to look back at it from the present moment, something of it is always lost from view.

To read desire in discourse with Deleuze and Guattari’s theories in mind encourages readers to make connections, to follow movements, to create new possibilities instead of closing them down with interpretative solu- tions. One of the most important moves Deleuze and Guattari make, particularly for feminists, is to rethink desire outside of lack and outside a negative framework. In her early work on desire and Hegel, Judith Butler argues that Deleuze’s theory moves desire from a negative interpretation towards a productive one. She writes: ‘Deleuze’s theory prescribes a move from negative to productive desire which requires that we accept an emancipatory model of desire’ (1987, 213). In Anti-Oedipus, the first of their two-volume series on ‘capitalism and schizophrenia’, Deleuze and Guattari argue that ‘the traditional logic of",

For we need sufficient ‘background information’ to be able to key into and make sense of another’s experience, and so it is incumbent on feminists to learn as much as possible about the worlds of others to whom they wish to offer solidarity.

Similarly, Haraway argues that the political foundation of the cyborg is the postmodern recognition of the historical fl ux of all identities, including biological, gender and species identities: ‘We are excruciatingly conscious of what it means to have a historically constituted body’ (155). It is ‘historically constituted’ in two senses of the word: as the contingent result of the historical process of evolution; and as the discursive construct ‘fi ltering’ the biological reality within a specifi c cultural and historical matrix. The two are inextricably linked. The fi rst posthumans are the Eloi and the Morlocks. Haraway is sceptical of the concept of choice because according to her ‘choice grounds a liberal politics and epistemology’ (173). But this is refuted by the very SF texts she implicitly references in her depiction of the human-machine- animal hybrid. The Eloi and the Morlocks did not choose to be what they are",

There is no general or transcendental subjectivity; sub- jects are only given as, or known through, particular modes of embod- iment, and it is the specific contribution of women’s embodiment that demands a feminist understanding of subjectivity. (Like the critique of anthropomorphism this demand for a positive feminism refuses to see a general ground, logic or subjectivity that is not lived in a certain way. The subject is not a general condition but is always given or known in a determined way.) Irigaray’s representational aporia might be seen as exemplary, not only of feminist ethics, but of any post-enlightenment demand for a specific or positive ethics. What makes representation crucial to this aporia is its location as the very limit of experience and",

In addition, the growing interest in the work of H. P. Lovecraft and object-oriented ontology, alongside the rise of black metal theory, bleak theory, the dark enlightenment and eliminative nihilism, not to mention accelerationism, suggests that there is a certain, darker tradition in contemporary theory, one that arises alongside the re-emergence of realism in contemporary thought. It is this connection between realism and pessimism that I develop in this chapter. More pre- cisely, building on the work of Dienstag, Thacker and Ligotti, I show how",

This phenomenon, which at first might appear as a simple transposition of castration-the head has been cut off instead of the genitals-has a much deeper significance: it shows us how the very possibility of figuring the human body is inevitably tied to the representation of pain. I found it crucial to highlight this copresence of pain and representation, espe­ cially today, when facing pain has become increasingly difficult; pain is either repressed or exploded into violence and massacre. Representation depends on a more intimate experience of pain, an intimacy that is currently in need of renewal. 133",

This tension is resolved by recourse to the heterogeneity of both materiality and subalternity, which allows for surprise (99, 101) and epistemological dissent (108). In this manner, Varadharajan’s subaltern becomes the locus of an immaculate, radical, pristine materiality and an immanent, negative, destitute materiality.

When desire is expressed or represented in language (and there are many genres and speech events devoted to that purpose, from personal ads to pornography and from high-ﬂown love sonnets to crude locker-room ban- ter), it is intelligible because it draws on codes of signiﬁcation that circulate within the wider society – in Eckert’s terms, they are ‘external and shared’. Individuals cannot choose not to have their desires understood in terms of prevailing social norms – that is why some women still say ‘no’ when they would like to say ‘yes’ (see chapter 2, note 9), and why some men still refuse to take ‘no’ as a deﬁnitive answer. Of course Keith Harvey and Celia Shalom (1997: 1) have a point when they suggest, following Lacan, that erotic experience always exceeds the capa…",

In fact, we might wonder whether Deleuze’s cinema theory is, at some deeper level, a reworking or ‘buggery’ of the Bazinian theme of realism. Manuel De Landa, for example, has stressed the element of dynamic realism in Deleuze. 9 The referent of realism in the Cinema books is not the faithful reproduction of the object in an external reality, but the structure of time and movement, or the ‘kinesiology’ from which cinema derives its name.

Kristeva argues for ghosts or grotesques, so explicitly created to embody contradictions, as instances of what she calls the “abject” and prod- ucts of “abjection,” which she derives from the literal meanings of ab-ject: “throwing off” and “being thrown under.” What we “throw off,” she sug- gests, is all that is “in-between . . . ambiguous . . . composite” in our beings, the fundamental inconsistencies that prevent us from declaring a coherent and independent identity to ourselves and others (p. 4)…",

Although the term responsibility implies the existence of and adherence to some normative, ethical standard, Haraway did not spell it out in this way. Instead she stuck to the metaphor of war, in which the stakes were ‘the territories of produc- tion, reproduction, and imagination’ (1991: 150). In these terms she speciﬁcally looked at ‘two overlapping groups of texts for their insight into the construc- tion of a potentially helpful cyborg myth: constructions of women of colour and monstrous selves in science ﬁction’ (1991: 174).

Interestingly, Lippit reads Tanizaki’s cultural particularlism—especially the shadowy Japanese body that “writes on others, infect[ing] them with darkness” (107)—as a prescient 1930s alternative to the 1940s atomic writing that would obliterate bodies with light. 4.

In his book-length treatment of the theme, Mbembe draws heavily on the dense and complex psychoanalytical studies of colonial mentalities by Frantz Fanon to access the symbols, languages and meanings which can stage a reimagining of that frag- mentation in its universality.

But the histor- ical origins of the icons contemporary sadomasochists invoke are self-evident. Susan Sontag called attention to the way the insignia of fascism—leather, Nazi helmets, steel spike collars, caps, and chains—had been recruited to sadomasochistic sexuality (Sontag, 1980, p. 105). Fascism was a radical, ultimately malevolent attempt to reconﬁgure power in the real world. It seems somewhat para- doxical that sadomasochists should have recruited this obscene historical legacy to provide the props with which to construct their own dress-up fantasies, but the reasons may reside in subliminal fantasies.

      "text": "This work itself benefits from the addition of later insights from Judith Butler, whose writing on gender both further responds to, and rethinks, Lacan’s ambivalences. Butler argues for the radically constructed nature of gender, and the manner by which the signifier comes to inhabit the body, binding it to the structural rails of gender. Butler writes: ‘“sex” is that which marks the body prior to its mark, staging in advance which symbolic position will mark it, and it is this latter “mark” which appears to postdate the body, retroactively attributing a sexual position to the body’ (1993, 97). We see sex as the mark of otherness: the mark prior to the symbolic system that invests the body with meaning. But sex is itself retroactively determined by the sexual position that will be named and delimited as, and by, gender within the symbolic system. In another instance of the non-originary origin, gender is the effect that",

Additionally, there is a glaring mistake evident in such an interpretation: the equation of masochistic corporeal pleasures with the act of vaginal penetration. Erika’s letter makes no mention of such an act, indeed, the only penetration that occurs in the passage that Walter reads pertains to Erika’s tongue and his anus. The formula of ‘normal’ sex that has been reiterated over and over in Western discourse overwrites the deviant practices that the masochist covets. The extent to which Walter is in control in this scene is ambiguous, for his subjectivity is also thrown into chaos as the film progresses, but it is clear that this ‘rape’ is",

Sontag’s critical distance allows her to enumerate the many ways these images are not what they seem. “Photographs are often invoked as an aid to understanding and tolerance,” she observes: “But photographs do not explain; they acknowledge” (111).7 In fact, she argues, when people falsely assume that they represent the real, photographs actually …",

Deleuze's response to phenomenological readings of the lived body as the site for art production is highly critical, although it is clear that he owes a debt not so much to Merleau-Ponty as to Uexkull (as we shall see in further detail in the next chapter, a phenomenolo- gist or semiotician not of the conscious human subject but rather of the animal), and his understanding of nature as the patterned counterpointing of phenomenologically selected environments: the spider carries within its web a complex picture of the prey it is to capture—its web is a map of and a counterpoint to the fly.",

From body to voice: labial logic I hope that by gathering together the voices of various women we have been able to hear something that we do not usually hear when we read their work in isolation. It seems to me that we can resist the temptation toward constructing our own phallic theoretical mothers by situating individual works within the context of a maternal genealogy.

All things considered, death only opposes the happy fecundity of practice with the pullulation of error - beyond a silence that gives us over to the worst. How can one withhold value from efficacious activity, reserving it for that which overwhelms us, for that which makes our powerlessness manifest? The agreement seems unanimous, but the opposition is perhaps poorly situated. In efficacious activity man becomes the equivalent of a tool, which produces; he is like the thing the tool is, being itself a product. The implication of these facts is quite clear: the tool's meaning is given by the future, in what the tool will produce, in the future utilization of the product; like the tool, he who serves - who works - has the value of that",

As he says: 'The subject of sensation is neither a thinker who takes note of a quality, nor an inert setting which is affected or changed by it, it is a power which is born into, and simultaneously with, a certain existential environment . . .

That move away from a purely textual analysis is even more evident in the feminist take-up of the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty (1962), in which the being-in-the-world of the subject is intricately and irreducibly bound up with the constitution and extension of the body.

Dennis King Keenan also calls into question an inviolable distinction between the other and the il y a, alleging a complicity between the frankness characteristic of language and its shadow, the equivocation emerging from the il y a (1999, 17–18). John Caputo raises a variation of this criticism, collapsing the difference between the il y a and Levinas’s notion of illeity, the holiness by which the alterity of the other is preserved.

The notion of proximity that becomes so important in Otherwise than Being is in fact a key term in the description of erotic subjectivity in Totality and Infinity. This does not, of course, mean that ethics becomes sexual in the later work, but only that Lévinas attempt to think together the embodied and spiritual aspects of the encounter with alterity. There had always been a wedge between these two in the earlier work as there is, according to certain critics, in Platonic ontol- ogy. An important advance arising from this shift of emphasis is Lévinas’s resolution of the problem of the ‘the third’ or the problem of the second face. In the earlier work, only infinite desire for the face could do justice to the otherness of the other and in this sense, ethics and justice were equiva- lent terms for Lévinas.

In fact, in the highly influential writings of the Italian autonomist Marxists and postworkerists (e.g., Negri, Christian Marazzi, and Tiziana Ter- ranova), the very idea of objective reality, and with it the ability to objectively measure surplus labor in the digital economy, is rejected in favor of the argu- ment that value is increasingly “subjective” (based no longer on labor but affect, values, and beliefs) and thus outside measure.

That second form of finitude derives from the fundamental exteriority and materiality of meaning and communication itself, of any form of semiotic marking and iterability to which both humans and nonhuman animals are subject in a trace structure that, as he puts it, exceeds and encompasses the human/animal difference and indeed “the life/death relation” itself.

Though the natural world knows death, it cannot be divided into living and nonliving. “Living form,” Raine discovers, does not distinguish animal from plant from mineral.

She asserts that in tandem with the symbolic mode, we must also attend to the semiotic modality of signification, expressed through the concept of the semiotic chora. The semiotic is associated in her theory with nonverbal systems of meaning-making and interpretation such as music, kinesis and gesture, systems that are experienced more immediately, less ‘rationally’ and more viscerally. Although the subject and the processes of signification that constitute subjectivity and intersubjectivity arise from the movement or dynamic between the two modalities that Kristeva identifies, symbolic language has repeatedly been privileged over the semiotic chora.

Her important writing on companion species works to similar purposes, and her very recent coinage, “Chthulucene,” appears in Jill Schneiderman’s mapping of the Anthropocene naming controversy. Butler and Grosz figure in Lynne Huffer’s essay as repre- sentatives of the persistence of a shared concept of life or vitality in denaturalizing and renaturalizing feminism, respectively.

Even if other parts of their writing ‘scour the unconscious’ and create desiring-­machines, the idea that these machines work either inclusive of, or in spite of, such perceptions of the orgasmic is equally unsettling.

So too for the performance of gender, in which the subject is constrained by categories that exceed her even as she may struggle to remake them in the shape of her own life.

The easiest criticism of Agamben’s political writings is that they are marked by a deep haphazardness: important distinctions are blurred and concrete examples sublated into an essen- tialist, ahistorical argument that is potentially paralysing because it passes over the situational specificities that characterise real politics. My claim is that such criticisms depend in large part upon a category mistake; that Agamben’s most important concepts will remain unintel­ ligible to us until we understand their grounding in a political ontology that turns on an attempt to think the question of being.20 Let me explain this by turning first to the important concept of the inclusive exclusion, which Agamben invokes in order to map the paradox he finds at the heart of the Western polis. In this aporia, the natural life of human subjects is excluded from the city as something",

We ﬁnd early examples of the formalist approach in such essays as Susan Sontag’s ‘‘Against Interpretation’’ and ‘‘Godard’s Vivre Sa Vie,’’ both of 1964, in which Sontag argues that critical interest should be formal rather than thematic and that the most gripping contemporary works of art are interesting because of the immediacy of their images and their handling of problems of form. Sontag’s essays stand at the beginning of a long line of critical work that, for diverse reasons, emphasizes the formal at the expense of the thematic in its discussions of the postmodern. The thematic approach is already present in some of Charles Olson’s essays of the 1950s and in Leslie Fiedler’s and Ihab Hassan’s work of the 1960s. What is emphasized here is a postmodern attitude, expressed through a variety of themes, that resists the modernist intellectualization of experience and …",

A further significant recent intervention is found in Scott Lash’s development of Dick’s relevance to global information culture and what he calls ‘intensive culture’, using Dick’s experimentation with notions of transubstantiation to develop parallels and convergences between the becoming substantial of the divine in religious thought, and the way ‘substance enters the commodity itself’ in infor- mational capitalism (2010: 185). The most recent attempt at developing an overall reading of Dick’s oeuvre is Umberto Rossi’s Twisted Worlds (2011). Rossi attempts to provide a key and framework for understanding Dick’s work which he elucidates and affirms through readings of a large number of Dick’s novels, suggesting that his approach may also be applied to those works he is not able to explore in depth.

In this context, what is particularly relevant to this study is The Pleasure of the Text, A Lover’s Discourse: Fragments, and Camera Lucida’s emphasis on a loss of self, which relates to the erotic experience and to the political poten- tial of jouissance. Barthes’s late work enables a clarification of the positive aesthetic of formally innovative texts that have so far been confined to a primarily negative rhetoric. The loss of self that Barthes theorizes allows us to understand the erotic fusion of text and reader, a fusion that allows a mutual constitution of reader and open text. The authors of Plus, AVA, DICTEE, and VAS exploit the erotic and political qualities of this mutual constitution. In fact, Barthes’s and Maso’s visions of literature are particularly close, as both think that, in a metonymic",

She engages in a treacherous but rhetorically effective slippage between the liberal ‘unitary’ (2004: 193) and self-sufﬁ cient ‘master subject’ (2004: 194) and the subject as such. In contrast to this, I contend that it is possible to see the gendered subject as a changing and multi-dimensional product of social and discursive processes, while nevertheless comprehending this social product as real, and as irreducible to the process of its production. The critical realist Margaret Archer confronts this kind of fruitless search for a substantial entity as the only legitimate ground for claiming that the self exists: ‘There is’, she argues, ‘no entity or substance to ﬁ nd, but that only means [one] is looking for the wrong “thing”’ (2000: 123).",

Taking the perceptual and tactile imagined experience of Poe's \"gum-like water\" to say that I experience with joy a certain pleasure in kneading it would be the same thing, for the phenomenologist, as saying that the water' 'of- fers me a meaning\" of a fantastic world. Thereis no need to reduce this phenom- ena to an underlying fantasy. That which shows itself to me is measured in terms of that which it is possible for me to say about it. A phenomena is thus identified with the sayable, hence the definition of phenomenology as the description of liv- ed experience, and the need for many words that tell of an experience which in itself is mute.

But what this theory actually shows us is once again a determinate social order and history reduced to a theater, let’s say, which allows us to see something else. I have taken my own case, which is surely not exceptional, being neither artistic nor pathological, as an example of a useful shuttling back and forth between the social order and the semiotic chora and vice versa. Therefore, what remains valid of Kristeva’s theory is the part that underlines the instance of the semiotic, that is, of the originary experience of the relation with the mother. The theory of the thetic break must be seen, rather, as the expression of a historically deter- mined symbolic order. Therefore, the thesis according to which truth becomes possible with the thetic stage must be revised. This thesis is only valid for correspondence-truth.…",

The task is, instead, to record the crisis of modern interpretive systems without smoothing it over, to affirm that this crisis is inherent in the symbolic function itself and to perceive as symptoms all constructions, including totalizing interpretation, which try to deny this crisis: to dissolve, to displace indefinitely, in Kafka's words, 'temporarily and for a lifetime'. Perhaps nothing of the wise Stoic interpreter remains in the analyst except his function as actor: he accepts the text and puts all his effort and desire, his passion and personal virtuosity, into reciting it, while remaining indifferent to the events that he enacts. This 'indifference', called 'benevolent neutrality', is the modest toga with which we cover our interpretive desire. Yet by shedding it, by implicating ourselves, we bring to life, to meaning, the dead discourses of patients which summon us. The ambiguity of such an interpretive position is both",

Instead it is, in part, a defence of amorous, sentimental addresses. Barthes attempts throughout his writings to chal- lenges the doxas, the conventions, of society and of thought. A Lover’s Discourse challenges antithetical doxas: the orthodox romanticised beliefs about love, but also the denigration of these beliefs as trite, senti- mental and delusional. Barthes’ book responds to both the valorisation of love and the deprecation of love. He reveals the cultural fabrication of love undermining the mythical naturalisation of love but equally he elab- orates and expands love’s texts contesting the critique of love and its pleasures. While love is on the one hand valorised it has also been dismissed as a delusion, a res…",

Most centrally, Deleuze and Guattari argue that Reich is the first to address the relationship between desire and the social field (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 118) but that he fails to locate the link between the two. What he would have needed, they suggest, is an idea of desiring production that links them together (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 30).

It may not be the case that Blanchot thought the first version deficient, but rather that its excess only indicates one way in which the narrative could be pursued and that there might be another version that was more restrained in its demonstration. In this way the move toward the récit may have been guided by a sense of offering a narrative that could emerge without going by way of excess. Starobinski suggests that the movement between the two versions extends the same movement of attenuation that is accomplished in the images of the narrative itself, such that they become more transpar- ent to their ambiguous literary status as both (abstract) thoughts and (concrete) images. As he goes on to show, this refinement of the language of the narrative consists in a reciprocal contamination of the concrete and the abstract in which abstract terms are encountered concretely and mate-",

With Sade we witness an astonishing development of the demonstrative use of language. Demonstration as a higher func­ tion of language makes its appearance between sequences of description, while the libertines are resting, or in the interval between two commands. One of the libertines will read out a severe pamphlet, or expound inexhaustible theories, or draft a constitution. Alternatively he may agree to hold a conversation or a discussion with his victim. Such moments are frequent, par­ ticularly in justine, where each of the heroine's torturers uses her as a listener and confidante. The libertine may put on an act of trying to convince and persuade; he may even proselytize and gain new recruits (as in Philosophy in the Bedroom). But the intention",

Similarly, feminist philosophers of science and epistemologists have taken the role of our emotional and relational lives into consideration when discussing the production and reception of knowledge. Feminist philosophers have then pointed to the broad impact a relational under- standing of the self and subjectivity can have on philosophical matters. This revised understanding of subjectivity and connectedness has underscored the relevance of narrative accounts of the self and of social identity that portray the self as necessar- ily emerging out of dialogical contexts beyond the borders of any sub- discipline. Any one of these emphases is not unique to feminist philosophy. Take for instance, the use of ﬁ rst- person experiences: other philosophers use ﬁ rst- person experiences to jog our intuitions or concretize a type of problem.

Similarly, such elements from sublime nature denote the important liminal qualities of the fear experience, and we see this very clearly in The Mist. It is important to note that the zone demarcated by the mist outlines a site of both the uncanny and the sublime in the film. Within this liminal space, the hesitation experienced in the encounter with the invisible Other recreates the hesitation that defines the gap in the interaction of the cognitive and imaginative faculties of the subject in the encounter with the sublime.

Do you see it? Well, it doesn’t see you!’ (1994 [1973], 95, author’s italics). Lacan admits that he found it difficult at the time to see the humour in the man’s joke, since he was the object of it. But in reflection, it is a parable that allows him to articulate the function of the screen. Lacan’s mirror theory stresses the importance of the articulation of an ‘I’ as the entrance into the symbolic order. As Patrick Fuery argues in his Theories of Desire: ‘The subject, driven by desire, enters the mirror stage and subsequently the Symbolic in search of a satisfaction that can never be achieved. This is “desire” understood as an active process’ (1995, 17). Fundamentally what Lacan does through the mirror theory is to suggest an earlier drama to the Oedipal complex and a relationship between",

Then it ends abruptly with Ramón being rescued and gasping for air. The organiza- tion of this sequence has several functions. First it establishes a parallel- ism, a spiritual connection even, between Julia and Ramón. As Julia is terminally ill, she can understand Ramón’s death wish from the inside. Secondly, it shows how inextricably Ramón’s past and present are inter- twined: the past events defi ne the present in a most dramatic way.

Thus Butler’s section on “The Body Politics of Julia Kristeva” takes issue with what she regards as a strain of essentialism in Kristeva’s potentially “subversive” concepts (1999, 101-119). According to her reading, Kristeva’s emphasis on the semiotic as the movement of instinctual, pre-Oedipal drives sets up a divided conceptual structure where the maternal function and body are attributed an “ontological status” prior to culture, and the paternal law which governs this culture is a purely repressive agent. Butler argues that this has two politically problematic consequences.

      "text": "within the categories of our own making is, for Derrida, the crucial moment in the ethical relation. Nonetheless Derrida himself does not always avoid this trap. Frequently the metaphor of femininity or woman is used in his writings as a metaphor for otherness itself, or for the indeterminacy of that which escapes fixity. Levinas, in rejecting a ‘totalising’ conception of understanding, sees no understanding of the Other as adequate, or ethically acceptable, which conceptualises them within a system, for example, within a framework of psychological theory. For this will, in Hegelian fashion, impose our own view of the world upon them, locating them within that world, rather than responding to them as a voice from beyond it. The alternative is not to capitulate to the Other’s view. It is rather to respond to the Other as making demands prior to any specific view of the world. For Levinas, in contrast to Heidegger, such relationships are",

This impressive project vividly exemplifies the entanglement of flesh, data, and other matter that characterize Barad’s notion of “the ontological inseparability of intra-acting agencies” (Barad, 2003: 206). To be fair, Ratto et al.’s project involved the printing of lower limbs, and not hands (for this, see the Victoria Hand Project), so the connection between prosthesis and handwork may not have been obvious. More to the point, since Ratto’s version of critical making prioritizes “processual acts” over evocative objects, it is understandable that he would not want to view the prostheses made in his lab as objects-to-think- with (2017: 153). In fact, viewing them in this way might diminish their status as humanitarian assistive d…",

Correspondingly, Dorothea Olkowski situates Deleuze’s writ- ings in relation to theories of the body and desire in recent femi- nist philosophy. She argues that Deleuze and Guattari’s account of the body and desire does not establish a precultural eros, as some feminists claim. Focusing in particular on Nietzsche and Philo- sophy and Anti-Oedipus (by Deleuze and Guattari), Olkowski argues for a conception of positive desire that is not connected in any way to the Platonic schema of “man” as lacking being and therefore limiting human productive activity. She questions Oedipal constructions of the body and desire as hierarchical and exploitative. She further demonstrates how, for Deleuze and Guattari, the body (understood broadly as chemical, physical, biological, and social) is the force that undermines such construc- tions so that productive desire can once again open up human creative and political freedom.",

In addition, women’s subjectivities have historically been pushed to the margins of western philosophy, which theorises the male body-and-self as the ideologically-neutral, default subject-position (Battersby 1998; Irigaray 1985a; Irigaray 1985b; Young 1990a), and which in turn marks the body, for women themselves, as a ‘problem’ (Rich 1996; Young 1990b). In Volatile Bodies Elizabeth Grosz (1994) notes that in the West female corporeality is con- ceptually constructed in terms of viscosity and liquidity, ﬂows and secretions. This ontological structuring of the female body is marked by a sense of uncontrollable ‘seepage’ that positions women’s bodies as both passive and dependent, and unruly and disordered, but ultimately seconda…",

Kristeva’s attention to the weakness of discourses of love, loss, and sepa- rateness in late modern societies does not only grasp the formation, deformation, and transformation of the structure of being with others. It also raises the question of what is lost, what loss is, and what mourning might be in these societies. Part 2 of the book turns to Kristeva’s thought on religion and art. First, chapter 5 shows that Powers of Horror provides a minor history of how religions took on the task, neglected by modern institutions and discourses, of elaborat- ing the limits of the ties between individual and society. That is to say, the his- torical religions provide symbolizations of the instabilities and capacities which make up the less visible features of the structure of being with others.

The national body’s retreat from a dialectical understanding of history, then, is revealed symptomatically and in the same time span in the body of the “average” Austrian male as simultaneously sexual prowess, impotence, boredom, self-hatred and exaggerated self-love.

The traumatized, we might say, carry an impossible history within them, or they become themselves the symptom of a history that they cannot entirely possess. (1995: 5) Caruth's articulation of a crisis of historical experience resonates powerfully with the broken narratives and disrupted lives which have emerged out of the debris of recent traumatic events.

Functioning by analogy and simile, they tend to reduce, hypostatize, and impose meaning on a constantly moving reality better captured through cinema’s diachronic form. My readings will nevertheless suggest that Foer’s novel and Spiegelman’s comix successfully overcome this reductive aspect of images, enlisting them to portray specifically tem- poral forms of knowing.

A naked face without mystery or expression—reduced simply to being on display—is obscene and pornographic. Capitalism is aggra­ vating the pornographication of society by making every­ thing a commodity and putting it on display. Knowing no other use for sexuality, it profanes eros—into porn.

He shows, in the ﬁrst place, that the ‘‘surplus validity’’ or ‘‘semantic excess’’ of normative ethical concepts (for instance, responsibil- ity) can be regulated only according to a normative dimension or context that is also (but in a different way) excessive. But in the second place, and relatedly, Levinas also shows the instability of the distinction between the concrete instance of judgment (this or that circumstance arises and a deci- sion must be taken: for instance, the decision to sacriﬁce constitutionality to the life of the city, as Levin might phrase it, or the decision to entertain the supposititious scenario he outlines in the ﬁrst place), the normative concept we apply in making the decision (responsibility, or the possibility and value of weighing one life and many), and the normative context stipu-",

One way to view Merleau-Ponty’s discussion is as addressing the question we noted in the first section of this chapter as exercising analytic philosophies: do sensations have so-called phenomenal or sensational content as well as having intentional objects? We saw at the outset that Merleau-Ponty rejects ‘pure sensation’ as an illusion and with it, we may add, the whole notion of content in terms of which the question is posed.

Th e death drive is beyond love and hate, sadism and masochism, because it is associated with the cerebral event, the destructive annihilation of personality by means of a wounding trauma. Th e death drive is the augur of a new materialism, a materialism that is completely outside the psychic subject, and the subject is exposed to a vulnerability that she cannot control or assimilate. Th is materialism refuses the conventional opposition between brain and thought as well as the distinction between the brain and the unconscious. A new materialism is based upon a new philosophy of spirit (esprit) that is plastic because it articulates a cerebral event, cérébralité, based upon the formation and deformation of neuronal connections.10 Although her reading is a critical reading, Malabou does not simply dismiss Freud’s work and",

This leakage of meaning, which is not the same as its abolition, enables [Antonioni] to disturb the psychological certitudes of realism’ (DAN, 65).16 These, I think, are the certitudes which prevent Barthes’s work from embracing Hollywood cinema. While the writings of Roland Barthes are my great professional love, I nonetheless find it disappointing that his engagements with Hollywood cinema effectively take the films at face value and never subject them to the kind of patient, close analysis bestowed upon the literary text in S/Z and Sarrasine de Balzac.17 Barthes might have gone further with Hollywood, I",

Yet Lacan’s earlier works establish the importance of the body to the con- struction of the subject. Experienced initially as a heap of disparate parts, the body is straightened out or made “orthopaedic” by the subject’s desire (Écrits 4). But, of course, an autopsy takes the body back apart, punc- turing its surface manifestation along with the subject’s desire; now we desire to dismember the body. The skin will no longer disguise the body as one seamless fabric, the muscles as one harmonious kinesis, the bones as one symmetrical posture.

The ﬁlm, at the same time, connects these with a classed ethic. As authors like Eva Illouz (1997) and Elizabeth Povinelli (2006) have pointed out, the discourse of romantic love over social duty has a distinctly middle-class ethos to it. This ethos contains a detachment from eco- nomic necessities, practicalities and realities, such as child-raising. Thus, it is possi- ble to consider that the diﬀering positions which Sidney and Natasha take up with regards to the Girl are representative of two diﬀerent classed subjectivities and attitudes towards romantic love. Romantic agency and the aspirational characteristic of the romantic here are a temporary escape the Girl encounters in her situation as a working-class single parent.

It was without an object, so to speak: it was built on the past. But now there is hope, and pain is implanted in hope.' These losses had been so devastating that they had never been fully lived through or comprehended. The eroticizing of the maimed, utterly vulnerable figure of Robert enables Mar- guerite to access her suffering and direct it again into the world and reverse the process. From an insensate, numbed state she moves through painful participation and out into a renewed femininity.

Suffice it to say for now that I combine the philosophical theory of Realism, which admits to a real world (however one may end up defining it), with a theory of cultural models (social constructs). In the course of my work, I have found that the dead body, particularly at autopsy, is just too raw, too overpowering in its own right, to be simply seen as a cultural object. For instance, we may interpret its odor as the construct “odor of a cadaver,” but surely we must accept that it really is producing the smell! The material facticity of the cadaver was, to be sure, something that struck me deeply at the autopsy I attended. This man died at the age of sixty-two in the hospital under full resuscitate orders. We can rest assured that all medical interventions would have been attempted, but for some reason his body still succumbed.

Lorde prioritizes the sharing of the erotic— however beautiful and pleasurable or fraught—as structuring the conditions of possibility for greater political and social justice that might have been functionally impossible: for “joint concerted actions not possible before.”3 Yet she is also careful to note that the “erotic cannot be felt secondhand,” that it can and should be shared, but not reproduced through an economy of profi t and gain.

It was therefore logical that the Cours played a marginal role in the reception of Barthes’ oeuvre, which is why at the start of my research I found myself on terra incognita. What frustrated me the most was that Barthes himself, in his own les- sons, never really made clear what the notion of the fantasy—which was so important to his literary theory—actually meant. Nevertheless, I remained convinced that Barthes’ notion of fantasy was particularly suitable to conceive the intensity of the reading experience, an inten- sity such as the one incarnated for me in the painting of the Arntzenius sisters.

This is akin to Levinas: I have spoken a lot about the face of the Other as being the original site of the sensible. ...

Our disagreements, which I will address later, tend to proliferate at another level, having more to do with her eager- ness to remain fashionable or “cutting-edge,” which led her to dismiss rather too readily a few things I still hold dear, such as humanism, real- ism, and psychology.

This effect is achieved through two seemingly opposite, yet in fact supplementary and converging strategies.

The bad faith witnessed in Isabelle’s love relation­ ships (both her own specific bad faith of dependence and the bad faith of the men’s privilege) offers an ethical (and political) warning because it asks spectators to recognise the inequity within the relationships, the degrada­ tion of Isabelle as a being-for-herself, the vain transcendence of men who seek to control her and the avoidance of both parties to alter their respec­ tive modes of bad faith.

A kind of 'Braille for the deaf is required.

In each category we have searched for a harm associated with death that is ﬁt to play the role death plays in our moral theorizing and emotional lives. We found none. We are not exactly in a position to say, with the strongest form of Epicureanism, that death has no harm whatsoever associated with it. But the harms we have found are mundane, unconcerning in contexts that do not involve death. Perhaps they prevent us from saying that death is nothing to us.

Specifically, he argues that this phenomenon shows par excellence the common ‘flesh’ which bonds us with things. What we see is given form and texture by our body’s mode of orientation towards the world, and, in particular, by a layer of ‘invisibility’, that is, details of present, possible, and past bodily orientations which inform our vision but which we are not immediately aware of. The fact that this invisible dimension can structure perception is intimately bound up with the fact that we know ourselves as belonging to the sensible world, that is, we know that we who see and are sentient can ourselves be seen and sensed. With these points in mind we can now consider Merleau-Ponty’s claims about painting in the essay ‘Eye and Mind’. A useful starting-point is his remark that",

Now, Girard’s scapegoat undoubtedly bears some resemblance to Agamben’s homo sacer with regard to his exclusion from the community. Moreover, while Girard describes the erection of sacred institutions as the result of trying to control mimetic violence, he is by no means saying that they offer an authentic form of life, any more than Agamben is content with the act which he believes founds sovereignty by excluding homo sacer. In this respect alone Agamben and Girard might agree. Nevertheless, there is another subtle difference between them even here. By the very process of bearing the burdens of the community’s violence, the Girardian scapegoat, unlike Agamben’s homo sacer, becomes something unholy and holy; unholy or sacer because it is the target of the pent-up aggression of the community in mimetic crisis, and holy or sanctus because its death or exclusion is associated",

The task of recognizing gender as it is lived outside norms necessarily entails a holding open or a suspension of the position, thus supplanting a description of norms with what might be considered a speculative project in a Hegelian sense. Describing gender becomes a matter of describing the way that it is done and the way that it is undone, and if gender is a doing, that doing is accomplished in several different modes at once. There have been attempts to divide Butler’s early work on gender from her later work in various ways: psychic versus political, normative versus ethical.14 It could be suggested that the first decade of her work has been concerned with doing, and the second with undoing, evidenced by her recent works Undoing Gender and Giving an Account of Oneself, in which she poses the question: what does it mean to become undone by another?

If practice always comes before theory, the story goes, then the ideal objects of theory cannot be detached from the living, breathing Umwelt that supports the practice of thinking. This priority is again and again underscored by the phenomenologist, often as a way to remind the reader that this is real, tangible life we are talking about, not some docile mental construction or aloof realm of innocuous abstract enti- ties.

Some of these demarcations have become famous and might indeed give the impression that his work is obsolete. In order to motivate the thesis of this volume, it is important for us to address directly some of the arguments put forward by those who assert that Merleau-Ponty’s work is outmoded.

What happens thereafter is that the subject finds substitutes or displacements for the missing thing, now repressed into (and thereby forming) the unconscious. Those substitutes or displacements thus fill the space of Desire, and will ever after represent an alienation of the subject from that which it desires, now symbolized in objects, Lacan's other 'little things' representing the autre - the objet petit a. This dialectical movement from recognition of lack to a desire to fill it is well illustrated in the Ramsays' relations with Charles Transley.

Given that most of his corpus is devoted to unpacking the relation of ethical responsibility and its impact upon the self, it is understandable why critics often find Levinas’s inquiries into other fields of philosophy, and especially in this regard, his remarks on art and aesthetics, pejorative or cursory. While I will devote a more sustained focus in the first chapter on Levinas’s treatment of art, consideration of how his ethical view might impinge on contemporary American horror cinema seems to rest tenuously on bridges constructed between his thought and Derrida’s, whose work has included more explicit inquiry into the theme of",

Both Bennett and Barad argue for a vibrancy of matter, which means that matter is an active participant, help­ ing to constitute its surrounding environment and political milieu. Bryant continues this trend explicitly within the context of an ontology. For Bryant there is a kind of politics of objects where different combinations of objects result in different manifestations of qualities and events. This is not a reduction of events to formal causality. Rather, this is a radical inclu­ sion of objects of all sorts within the realm of agency. According to Bryant, “if experimental activity is necessary, then this is because generative mech­ anisms” of objects “can be dormant, inactive, or veiled by the agency of other objects or generative mechanisms” (Bryant 2011, 48).

This rift between the living pres- ence of the other in the ego and its real absence is a cleavage so unbearable that we often want to reduce it not by moderating the love but by denying the absence while rebelling against the reality of the lack and refusing to accept the definitive death of the loved one. Such a rebellion against fate, such a denial of the loss is sometimes so tenacious that the mourner borders on madness. The refusal to admit the irre- mediable character of the loss or, what amounts to the same thing, to admit the incontestable character of the absence in reality, borders on madness but tempers pain. When these moments of rebellion ease, pain reappears as vividly as before.

As one of my favorite lines from Gender Trouble explained, “If there is no radical repudiation of a culturally constructed sexuality, what is left is the question of how to ‘do’ the construction one is invariably in” (31). In his famous explorations of masochism and fetishism, Tanizaki defi- nitely seemed to be “doing” his male and female constructions with the performative flair that Butler celebrates. Especially in the works on which I wanted to focus, from what Nakagami Kenji calls Tanizaki’s “overripe” period in the 1930s (“Monogatari” 130), relations among and between the sexes seemed no less perverse, and no less promising.

In Bodies that Matter, Butler acknowledges the constraints that limit the possibilities for self- invention. In particular, she maintains that performance is “reitera- tive and citational,” not self-determining. In The Psychic Life of Power, Butler continues to engage this issue by dwelling on the relation between power and agency. Power does not merely act on us, since it enacts us into being.

Kittler extends Foucault by exploring the media that forms the basis for the discursive practices of processing, storage and transmission. For Kittler, media themselves, the ‘technologically possible manipulations’ that determine what can be a discourse, became active archaeologists of knowledge as they set the protocols for data processing and thus governed the transmission and storage (as transmission in time) of information. At this point, ‘German media theory shifted the focus from the representation of meaning to the conditions of representation, from semantics itself to the exterior and material conditions of what constitutes semantics’ ( Siegert 2015 : 2). At this point, a radical anti-hermeneutical approach came to characterize the brand of media science that came after Kittler, usually focused on questions of s…",

Her work points to changes in the way in which “the social” is conceptualised: Theories of affect and the deployment of affective capacity are valuable at this conjuncture, she suggests, “to grasp the changes that constitute the social and to explore them as changes in ourselves, circulating through our bodies, our subjectivities, yet irreducible to the individual, the personal and psychological”. (Clough 2007: 3) (Pedwell and Whitehead 2012: 117) Sara Ahmed’s contribution to debates on emotion and affect has also been important and she shows how power works through affect to configure indi- vidual and social bodies (see Ahmed 2000). In The Cultural Politics of Emo- tion (2004) Ahmed’s critical point is that emotions can tie us into conditions of subordination. She also recognises that change is difficult to achieve because relations of power are: “so intractable and end…",

Perhaps there is no contra- diction here, like the teacher who writes on the blackboard in Godard’s Bande à Part, “Classique = moderne.” The point to remember is how often the younger Sontag pulled back from excess, how cautious and qualifying and reasonable she could be, having first staked out a doctrinaire position. The “against” title she used in her essay is a time-honored strategy for marshalling polemical energy; and when the author’s contrarian oppo- sition rears up against a seemingly ineluctable good (such as Joyce Carol Oates’s essay “Against Nature,” Laura Kipnis’s Against Love, or my own “Against Joie de Vivre”), there is an added fris- son of throwing down the gauntlet to conven- tion and common sense itself.

(Grosz 1995: 168) Thus, for instance, Mulveyan concepts key to a performative emphasis such as the dichotomy narrative-spectacle, while useful, are still locked in the very gender binaries that subtend them. Mulvey’s distinction between the image that advances narrative and the image that halts it is quite pertinent to both the contexts of the melodrama and the aﬀective-performative. After all, the exaggerated use of style in melodrama likewise injects a spectacular and arresting force into the linear inertia of the narrative. But Mulvey’s notion of the spectacular moment mirrors the fetishistic reduction that she herself imputes to the patriarchal mechanisms of the ﬁlm apparatus. By consider- ing spectacle a purely visual, static form, Mulvey overlooks not only accom- panying layers of sensual address in the image, but also its temporal movement and inhe…",

Reading, on this new, relational understanding, is an empirical process that emphasizes connections over verification and gives renewed agency to all manners of hybrids. It brings the reader face to face with a “crowd of squabbling, jostling, interconnected actors playing their parts” and places her as well within that performance to compose, translate, and interpret.59 This methodological sketch is, of course, hardly programmatic. Its generality underscores the difficulty of approaching hybrid networks specifically. Felski, who also takes stock of this difficulty in her two essays on Latour and literary studies, offers an interesting solution to the lack of specificity of network analysis.60 Instead of trying to solve the impossible question of the nature of literary networks, she focuses her analysis on the modalities of their mediations: what Latour…",

In general terms, Kristeva is attempting to explore the different ways in which abjection works within human societies, as a means of separating out the human from the nonhuman and the fully constituted subject from the partially formed subject. Ritual becomes a means by which societies both renew their initial contact with the abject element and then exclude that element. Through ritual, the demarcation lines between the human and nonhuman are drawn up anew and presumably made all the stronger for that process. (One of Kristeva’s aims in Powers of Horror is to present a rewriting of many of the ideas and beliefs put forward by the College of Sociology, specifically those associated with the nature of femininity, abjection and the sacred.

In Stephen King’s Pet Sematary, the return of the dead from the grave might be seen to materialize the affect implicit in both Blanchot’s and Kristeva’s remarks, since the horror they evoke appears predicated not only upon our apprehension of what Blanchot would call “beings deprived of being” (39) but also because, as corpses, they return us to “what [we] permanently thrust aside in order to live” (Kristeva, Powers of Horror 3).

One might ask how we are to think life’s immanent flow in relation to death itself, that most personal mortal event. Yet if death exists in all feeling, if life, that is, is always a series of affective increases or decreases in power, the means to thinking life through empowering repetition and the eternal return lies through art or, more specifically, modern cinema’s production of sensation and singular essences. For through its potential to expose virtual essences, affects, percepts and time’s flow as becoming and pure duration itself, through its revelations of impersonal singularities that negate one’s personal present death with an impersonal dying that opens to past-future becomings,",

      "text": "ognizable. Thus, it is our hope that this volume will oﬀer a substantial response to Teresa de Lauretis’s recent call in Critical Inquiry to “break the piggy bank of saved conceptual schemata and reinstall uncertainty in all theoretical applications, starting with the primacy of the ‘cultural’ and its many ‘turns’” (2004, 368). Such uncertainty requires risk, to be sure, as the specter of essentialism continues to haunt feminism. We think the risks are worth taking, however, since the emerging body of thought we are calling “material feminism” promises bold, provocative, and potent reconceptualizations of the material terrains of our shared worlds. notes 1. More evidence of discontent can be found in recent critiques of feminist anti-essentialism. Many have argued that at this point the denouncement of es- sentialism has become a rigid orthodoxy, more prohibitive and policing …",

In fact, much of Foucault’s corpus can be seen to have ethical undertones – and indeed to raise issues that appear, at least superﬁcially, to touch on an ethics of the other. His early work on madness from the 1960s, for example, argues that the Western Enlightenment scapegoated unreason as inherently different – and inferior – to reason. In the plea on behalf of the irreducible alterity of unreason found in History of Madness (1961), we see an almost Levinasian gesture towards the divinity of the other (though the language used does not approximate Levinas’s quasi-mystical discourse). And in his work on the penal system and the model of power it generates, Discipline and Punish (1975), he consider…",

Giorgio Agamben also identifies the ability to recognise ourselves as human based on our mirror images as the founding moment of the Western ideal of selfhood. Agamben contends that “man has no specific identity other than the ability to recognize himself” and “Homo sapiens, then, is neither a clearly defined species nor a substance; it is, rather, a machine or device for producing the recognition of the human.”17 The so-called “Thalidomide baby” of Plath’s poem is deprived of precisely such an ability, a moment of affirmation and self-recognition, thus they are excluded from the definition of the “human.” The anomalous embodiment of the child is incompatible with the logic of attaining a self- same identity based on self-recognition in a mirror image to an extent that the child’s monstrous otherness instils destruction in the very ideological framework, as “The glass cracks across.” Furthermore, the deployment of",

And each one of us, the special image or the contingent centre, is nothing but an assemblage of three images, a consolidate of perception-images, action- images and aﬀection-images.15 In eﬀect Deleuze has reduced aﬀection to a formal process of technical fram- ing, and in the process he has disembodied aﬀect, locating it outside the sub- ject in the world of technically assembled images.

Hence the crystal image is one that is \"present and past, still present and already past, at once and the same time\" (79). In such images there is an indistinguishability between the actual and virtual temporalities within an image. The actual is the present of what is seen in the image, and the virtual is the past and future that coexist in the actual image of the present.

He illustrates the meaning and relation of these terms using the rose. The rose may operate as a signiﬁer that is used to convey a signiﬁed, which is passion, and the two together (the signiﬁer and signiﬁed) create the sign: ‘passioniﬁed’ rose (Barthes 2000: 113). Another example may help clarify. Take the word woman. The word, ‘woman’, just the sound of the word, without any content or attached meaning, is the signiﬁer. The sig- niﬁed, however, is not the female person to whom I might point before me. Rather, the signiﬁed is the concept or idea of woman that I imagine.

Deleuze and Guattari describe Lacan’s work as ‘complex’, which seems to be their code word for useful but flawed (they say the same thing about Badiou). On the one hand, they credit him with discovering desiring-machines in the form of the objet petit a, but on the other hand they accuse him of smothering them under the weight of the Big O (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 310).

For readers, this implicit paradox of the worst holds as its negative index the possibility for a sorrow experienced in an ultimately pessimal mode of self-knowledge in which even death itself, in other words, death as an escape from life, is a disappointment. Death’s disappointment is its non-possibility for escape, but due to death’s de-actualization as nothing- ness it necessitates itself as everything.

Merleau-Ponty’s oeuvre offers a detailed theory of embodiment, in which he dis- covers that the body is not something we “have,” but is rather something we ines- capably are. His keen attention to embodiment as consciousness thus provides a helpful method for corporeal attunement – useful for developing the ﬁgure of bodies of water.

The possibilities of gender transformation are to be found precisely in the arbitrary relation between such acts, in the possibility of a failure to repeat, a de-formity, or a parodic repetition that exposes the phantasmatic effect of abiding identity as a politically tenuous construction.

We can take Foucault’s Discipline and Punish as an example of this kind of his- torical ontology, in so far as it relates to modern forms of power. On the other hand, it is a matter of attempting to breach those limits, not in a spirit of deﬁ ant transgression, but in a slow and patient effort to modify the forms in which we live. Here we can take feminism and gay liberation as examples of social move- ments that have brought about signiﬁ cant modiﬁ cations of the social forms in which we all live. In Foucault’s conception, therefore, critical philosophy is essentially a form of thought that wrestles with the question of our historically imposed limits, and tries to connect up with practices that push beyond those limits.

These images provide a clear, since ampliﬁed, instance of the process by which a gendered identity is constituted through the necessary act of imagining, as well as resisting, bodily boundaries. We identify with a masculine identity that is con- stituted before our eyes, enacted through these narrative images of physical hardening. Judith Butler takes up this point when she suggests that ‘the body is not a “being,” but a variable boundary, a surface whose permeability is politically regulated.’ Butler sees the body as ‘a signifying practice within a cultural ﬁeld of gender hierarchy and compulsory heterosexuality,’ but the purchase of her analysis can also be extended in order to think about the racial constitution of the body (Gender Trouble 139).

Comparison is, perhaps, the wrong word here, since we are talking not so much of the placing of one work in relation to others as of the registering of the relational position of signs and works within systems of meaning. Perhaps the most famous expression of such a view of the literary work, now called a text, comes in Roland Barthes’s essay of 1968, ‘The Death of the Author’.

We inherit the past from spectres and both the present and future are indebted to them as they shape the current moment. So, if we inherit from these spectres of the past then what are they? Where can they be found and, if possible, can they be identified? For Derrida, the spectre is not a physical being but instead has a non-present presence. The spectre is often more visible by the marks and traces it leaves on the present rather than in any physical form. Drawing on the ghost in Shakespeare’s Hamlet Derrida suggests that the ‘time is out of joint’ (2006, 20) and that history is not linear but rather anachronistic and prone to repetition, there…",

The focus here is on a broader philosophical distinction between the ‘time-image’ and the ‘movement-image’. At the same time, Deleuze does see certain cinematic examples of ‘slow cinema’ (i.e., the cinema of Michelangelo Antonioni) as suspending the logic of cause and effect, and connecting images in terms of external causality (Walsh 2004: 196).

A beautiful globe, female figures looking and looking good: lines of flight and lines of sight – movements, projections and identifications enabled by code and vision machines shedding all but the semblance of nature, species, gender. The flight of the heroine, her fears, her desires, her fantasies and anxieties, takes off elsewhere: other identificatory possibilities and configurations (post-, trans-, hyper-) generate other prospects and projections. The logic of a particular version of the “post” – post-human and post feminist – seems fully realized in Alien Resurrection: the categories of human and gender appear obsolete, along with all the ideological bases – nature, bodies, feelings, ideals – that support them.

In Discipline and Punish, the body politic became the collection of our human bodies shaped by power and stamped with knowledge—the Power/Knowledge of the Leviathan-State.94 But since power was supposedly diffused, the tension, again, found no solution.

But, at this stage of Foucault’s work, it is by no means merely a correlative phenomenon.

Probyn concluded that ‘the productive force of desire can then be seen as it incessantly spins lines between the thing and the representation. Desire then is the force that connects and disconnects images and things’ (ibid.). Understood thus as a productive force and as an essence, desire is dissociated from the ambiguities of representation, and displaced from the usual, psychoanalytic ‘site and citing’ of desire ‘within a project of origins’ (1995: 15). This enables a point of departure from which to constitute ‘queer belongings’ in a network of material relations. Although speculation such as Probyn’s provided new and useful directions for queer theory and feminist art criticism that are unencumbered by the ambi- guities of the psyche, feminists have had reason to be deterred by the elaborate complexity of Deleuze and Guattari’s writing.

One echoes Kristeva’s personal experiences of both natality and death during her pregnancy – the two jointly signifying the process of becoming.

Of course there is love as well as war, laughter as well as howling, joy as well as torture. But have these two sets of features, positive and negative, really balanced out in the account book of human history to date? The answer is surely no. On the contrary, the negative aspects have not only been predominant, but in many times and places overwhelmingly so.

A concept of affective bodies as intense gatherings of forces, which is, in fact, a Spinozist understanding of the body that centers around the individual’s desire to flourish and applies to political bodies just as well (cf.

From my perspective, the most essential point is that the text as a methodological instrument presupposes a work on a dead body. Text is a discourse ﬁxed in a written form where the usefulness of the results of textual analysis relies on the assumption that the text always remains the same. When Eco claims that the text is a lazy machine, this is a euphemism. The life of the interpretative process is entirely the duty of the reader (Eco 1979: 24) and not the author whose narrative strategy has been ﬁxed once and forever. After ﬁxation, the author is “dead”. For Barthes, “the death of the author” is a methodological assumption with great impact on the advent of textualism (Barthes 1975 and 1977).

Kristeva characterizes the chora as ‘an ancient, mobile, unstable receptacle, prior to the One, to the father, even to the syllable, metaphorically suggesting something nourishing and maternal.’30 We can read this as an observation that the chora is the space out of which imagination and creativity rise into language.

Cinema and the Critique of Representation Deleuze's two-volume work on cinema, L'image-mouvement and L'image-temps, translated as The Movement-Image and The Time-Image, presents cinema as a conflictual field of thought, an arena where two fundamentally different ways of organizing thought and creat- ing relations clash.

She conjures up a radically new understanding of maternal, “heretical” (that is, subversive to the established order, unorthodox) ethics, yet she does so within a discourse (psychoanalysis) that is steeped in paternal authority. She documents how people are both fascinated and repelled by the foreigners in their midst, but she sees this attitude toward “foreignness” as a necessary and constitutive feature of our self- identity. She points to the importance of biological drives and energy, but notes that they can only be apprehended via our language and culture. She writes with feminist intent, but she is critical of the move- ment known as feminism. No wonder, then, that Kristeva has…",

Finally, Bernard Stiegler, in an essay that forms part of a longer work on what Stiegler terms ‘the pharmacology of spirit’, also develops one of Derrida’s key notions, in this case the ambiguous nature of the pharmakon. In ‘Plato’s Pharmacy’ Derrida demonstrated how the double meaning of this word - as both dangerous poison and health-giving drug - operates in Plato’s Phaedrus to complicate the relation between speech and writing. Without any indication that he is conscious of doing so, Plato simultaneously condemns writing as under­ mining the delivery of true meaning in speech and acknowledges that speech depends on just those properties for which writing is denounced. Stiegler’s essay extends the notion of a double-edged pharmakon into an account of the workings",

Some feminists will certainly continue to object to what they see as the cooptation of ‘woman’ in Deleuze’s work by an essentialist formulation which does seem to exclude real women. However, cultural feminists, such as Judith Butler, who see gender as a largely performative effect, will probably wel- come the Deleuzean notion of ‘becoming’ (Butler 1990, 1993). This is especially true of ‘cross-dressing’ as a kind of performance or masking, which characterises the mutual lure of the orchid and the wasp.

Cixous needs to be read less against herself—less as a proper name, a cult sponding to certain shifting preoccupations of global importance, though they might be articulated, in her own style, from a French vantage point. Through her readings we sense a concern both aesthetic and ethical for the world, and a grow- ing preoccupation with a site, a milieu, that is, with a need for new and other links with the world, the self, and, it is hoped, social collectivities.

Without engaging fi lm theory per se, Deleuze merges his philosophical concerns with his ideas about fi lm in his books Cinema 1: Th e Movement-Image (1983, trans. 1986) and Cinema 2: Th e Time-Image (1985, trans. 1989), monumental and infl uential volumes that remain very challenging reads. 5 By the late 1980s, however, as queer theory fl ourished and fi lm theory entered a waning period, the Cinema books were only just arriving in English translation, as were other Deleuzian texts; at that point, their disparities from his other works and from more typical concep-",

In the second volume of Capitalism and Schizophrenia, Deleuze and Guattari nego- tiate this problem of a multiplicity of desiring events through becoming-woman. If psychoanalysis has its heritage in the geneal- ogy of the human, then perhaps a becoming woman will disrupt the inherently normalising function of the human sciences. This is the question explored by Jerry Aline Flieger, who exposes the centrality and risk of becoming woman (as becoming imperceptible) in Deleuze and Guattari’s project. Set against identity politics, sub- jectivism and essentialism, ‘becoming woman’ precedes all ‘molar’ identifications; in so doing becoming seems to have lost not only its feminist but also its political force.

Whereas this “metaphysical” work of transformation then seemed like the very “day of creation,” photography has now entered an age in which only the “added thickness” of the paper vouches for the tenuous distinction between real and fake copies.

Elaine Scarry’s now canonical study The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World established that this new ordering of the material world occurs for the victim during the scene of torture. According to Scarry, before this scene, objects already play a crucial role in the formation of the subject. In the case of the tortured person, such objects are not only changed, but actually participate in the prisoner’s resis- tance, in the reconstitution of a reduced subjectivity, producing Scarry’s re- ordering of the subject’s relationship to the material world, but also giving the object a memorial charge that retains the residual presence of the disap- peared subject.13 This dangerous potentiality posed by the object is palpable in the way in which such everyday items were policed and pillaged during the dictatorship.",

For Barthes, a full analysis of modern mythologies can only be undertaken once deeper structures are aligned with specific social, cultural and economic forms (for example, capitalism and capitalist ideology). In Mythologies Barthes begins to move structuralism away from the over- formalized approach developed by Lévi-Strauss: instead, he combines abstract analysis of underlying structures with more impressionistic assessments of social context.This move is taken further in his later work, notably S/Z, which com- prises a detailed analysis of the story ‘Sarrasine’ by Balzac (Barthes, 1975).

In a moment of a great sadness and despair, Witold has a sudden need to see Ignacy; he sneaks to his house at night just to adore the sleeping teenager for a while. Interestingly, Gonzalo rather refrains from any direct seductive action toward Ignacy and instead asks his teenage servant Horatio to play sport with him (watching Ignacy and Horatio playing stick­ ball also intensifies Witold’s feelings). In other words, the erotic fascinations in Trans-Atlantyk have to be mediated by someone else (cf. the Girardian concept of mimetic desire).20 However, the reader will not know whether Gonzalo’s attempts prove successful, as the novella ends in a typically Gom­ browiczian absurd and non-conclusive way, w…",

Likewise, Sneja Gunew examines the potential effects on feminism of new forms of racism which emphasise cultural, rather than biolog- ical, difference. These contributions to this volume highlight the importance of feminists being vigilant about the perpetual reconfiguration of institutions, bodies, temporalities and categories. As well as recognising that some transformations in gender relations may be problematic for feminism, we also recognise how easily ‘transformation’ can itself become a buzz word for conservative politics and thus that not all calls for trans- formation are progressive. For example, flexible capitalism, modern forms of consumerism or what Celia Lury (1998), amongst others, has called ‘prosthetic culture’, may themselves use the discourse of transformation to produce a subject who can re-produce existing power relations.

This disease of the poets and aesthetes, who wilted, however, provides a different image to the one associated with cancer. It betokens something subtractive, an invasive disease that causes the body to shrink and to degenerate (Sontag 1983: 18).

Against these narratives and drawing on Irigaray, Rodgers proposes to resituate the subject of sound studies “within the waves.” Rather than voyages of conquest, Rodgers invokes diasporic journeys that transform, as well as inform, the researcher. Informed by Irigaray, Rodgers’s analysis reveals the essential relationality of sound as a materialization of forms of life. Sounds set us in relation to other humans, other species, and other environments. They demand an ethical attentiveness to these rela- tions, rather than a continued investment in domination and control.

However,’ she argues, ‘cyborgs do not re-inscribe or re-embody the traditional binarism between such categories’. Plurality in contrast to hierarchy becomes, in Haraway’s schema, the telos of feminism. This begs the question of whether plurality endangers the fundamental binary opposition at the heart of femininism—are we really ready to move beyond sexual difference? Post-feminism too often reduces the post-structuralist move to subvert oppositional categories into an end in itself.

Through regular acts of cleansing—often performed, in contrast with ritual cleansing, only in private (Miner 1956)—individuals carve out expressions of gender, class, morality, honor, and civility by using the skin and, by extension, hair and clothing as ‘‘public surfaces’’ (Broch-Due and Rudie 1993: 38) in- scribed with visual statements of social signiﬁcation. Among precolonial and early colonial societies in what is now Zimbabwe, smearing—the application of a mixture of soil and oil or fat to the skin—was thus both hygienic and decorative, the glossy sheen of bodies being regarded as a ‘‘fundamental …",

The essay begins with a survey of concepts of embodiment from Husserl and Sartre through Grosz and Butler to autopoietic theories of embodied life. But, extending Deleuze and Guattari’s claim that the experience of death is the essence of life, Colebrook argues that these theories of embodiment, and autopoietic theory in particular, cannot account for unbounded and disembodied life. How can we think viral life, evil and the inhuman – forms of life which ‘make their way through the world without a thought of sustain- ability’?

What Deleuze thought Bergson missed, however, was that the intermittence of the strip does nonetheless produce, in projection, images we can accept as cross sections of real temporality.

In order to explore these factors, we shall turn our attention to the \"cognitive phenomenology\" of Edmund Husseri. In the next major paper, James A.

Death qua nothingness is the death of the other, death for the survivor. The time of dying itself cannot give itself the other shore. What is unique and poignant in this instant is due to the fact that it cannot pass. In dying, the horizon of the future is given, but the future as a promise of a new present is refused; one is in the interval, forever an interval.

The slippage of time and difference disturbs any moment of self-presence from the outset. Life is always in motion. In relating to itself, it never simply coincides with itself. The trace always lives on in the absence of its origin, the sign is always read in the wake of the death of its author (even when, in an empirical sense, its author is very much alive). Life drifts, mortally wounded. This is more than an interesting intellectual conundrum or piece of speculative ingenuity, however. It is also the realization that life is a negotiation, an interpretation of traces, and that here lies the possibility of affirmation. The complicity between death and life is not necessarily a morbid alliance. As Derrida remarks, ‘I would not want to encourage an interpretation that situates surviving on the side of death and",

Such ownership is not possible, and the illusion of that object once owned and now lost feeds the idea of melancholia which is itself carrying the delusion of the ability to mourn. Perhaps the most signiﬁcant intervention on the topic of introjection and incor- poration is in the work of Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok (Abraham et al. 1984; Abraham & Torok, 2005), in which broadly the terms map onto the Freudian terminology of mourning and melancholia, respectively, with some sense of incor- poration and melancholia being unsuccessful, thus following the logic of the “dis- eased,” the “excessive cannibalism,” and an illness.

Thereby, it maintains fidelity to what is yet to come.” The final chapter affirms that love is necessary for thought to exist at all. “To be able to think, one must first have been a friend, a lover.” So concludes an encomium of love joined to a radical critique of a world that refuses it: to be dead to love is to be dead to thought.

A feminist analysis of neuropsychology, she claims, will enable those studying feminist psychology to rethink the nature of feminist psychology and the politics of feminist intervention in general (1998: 67). In order to accomplish this, Wilson turns to what might seem a curious theoretical source: Derridean deconstruction. Wilson uses Derrida to examine psychology as a science under erasure, a science radically at odds with the binaries that seek to control it (1998: 88). But despite this significantly different strategy, Wilson ends up occupying the same theoretical space as Grosz. She concludes that the feminist emphasis on gender has meant that the possibility of thinking biology as “other than an excluded, distant, and foundational use has been foreclosed in the majority of feminist projects” (1998: 54).

Still, the most fi nely diced snapshots of movement do not capture movement per se, which lies precisely in the dyna- mism that still-shots evacuate. In theorizing movement as the “any-instant- whatever,” Deleuze does more than just demote starting and stopping points or statuesque climaxes to an equal plane with every other image. He frames movement in temporal terms, and as a quality of pure change that cannot be reassembled from component parts. Th at is, adding together 240 frames of a bird beating its wings, blending iconic as well as “transitional” shots, does not equal the ten-second movement of the bird, which the frames can indicate but not capture, unless projected in series. This locution of the “any-whatever” that Deleuze introduces so early in Cinema 1 , so as to distinguish philosophical essences from false idealizations, repeats frequently across both books: in the “any-instant-whatever” by which",

Writing and reading are embodied and creative acts, and Setti poetically puts it thus: “Reading Braidotti is as if being or walking always on a fluid and changing line” (this volume, p. 133). It is also Braidotti’s relationship to writing that is key to Martine Menès in “The Subject in Question.” These narratives by a French philosopher and a psychotherapist not only show Braidotti’s thinking as it grows through embodied writing, but also tell a story of the French feminists of the 1980s. From hereon we skip to Italy, where Maria Serena Sapegno experienced Braidotti’s influential thinking and feminist presence. In “Between Two Worlds: Nomadism and the Passion of an Encounter,” Sap…",

The writer plays with the signifi er pain included in painting in order to stress the violence and the ‘combat’ contained in the act of painting or creating a work of art. She writes, ‘I know it by hearsay, one is at pains to create artistically, especially in painting. We have numerous evidence of the pain felt by painters. Of their ways of being at pains, of painting painstakingly’. The following chapter, ‘Spero’s Dissidances’, is devoted to the American artist Nancy Spero, whose work was itself inspired by Cixous’s The Laugh of the Medusa.

The second element regarding living less wrongly would be to consider the relevance of what Adorno described, in Negative Dialectics, as a new prime directive. This new prime directive involved the responsibility of humanity to ensure that nothing akin to the Holocaust be allowed to occur again. In terms of International Relations, this would appear to indicate a clear focus for the discipline. It could also suggest the possibility of a wider agenda that does not end at the species boundary.

She uses narrative to com- municate what she believes her audience most needs to know and feel about the moment that depicts “trauma, violence, physical indignity” (297). Rather than precluding representations of pain or using argument to impose her way of in- terpreting the image or narrative at hand, she creates an elaborate context that she hopes will allow readers to feel in ways that inform what they know.

Barthes advances the project further in S/Z, a book in which he analyses Balzac’s short story ‘Sarrasine’, by elaborating a reading method involving breaking the text down into very short sections, or lexia, and interpreting these through ﬁve codes which organise textual meanings.

Relatedly, Grosz relies on the distinction between inside and outside, even as she focuses on enfolded surfaces. She writes that the body is “an open ma- teriality, a set of (possibly infinite) tendencies and potentialities which may be developed” (Grosz 1994, 190).

Richard Shusterman maintains (as noted earlier) that when the visual aspects of a text do strike us forcefully and are ‘visible’, those aspects are candidates for aesthetic appreciation. This, I think, parallels in some respects the distinction which Barthes draws in S/Z19 between the conventional ‘readerly’ text and modernist ‘writerly’ text—where the interrelations of writing, reading, and language itself become manifest and problematic. Now, it might be thought that such ‘visible’ or ‘writerly’ texts invite aletheic experience by their very ‘self-referential’ nature. This, however, would be an unfounded assumption. Some of Mallarmé’s later poems, for example, go far beyond the conventional handling of the medium, by introducing elaborate spacing of individual words, lines, and stanzas.

In that respect, to come back to Sara Ahmed, Noé drastically demonstrates that time makes the future perverse.72 Noé thus takes seriously the notion that from the perspective of hetero­ normative reproductive futurity, queer people represent a “a culture of death”.73 Drawing on Lee Edelman’s No Future and at the same time resisting it, Heather Love has proposed to read queer histories as struc­ tures of feeling in a backward sense. For her, queer histories, which are often rooted in past trauma, stigma and violence, pose a challenge to proj­ ects of futurity. On the one hand, queer people want to reclaim their iden­ tities and their histories from the catastrophe of the past; on the other, that",

Towards the end of his essay, Levinas thus speaks of ‘a new modality in the faith of today, and even in our moral certitudes’ (p. 100), one he ties, here and elsewhere, to the Jewish faith as an eschewal of the ensem- ble of ideas one would associate with theodicy. (I explore further this aspect of Levinas’s writings in the final section of the third chapter of this book, ‘Distress II’.) To the extent that this assertion moves us in a somewhat Kantian direction, it once more calls for thinking about the secular or social world as much as the religious sphere, which must be remade if ‘useless suffering’ is not to utterly overwhelm ‘faith’ or ‘meaning’ in a way that signals the ultimate redundancy of ethics.

The body through which thinking occurs is a site of opening of a world and others as much as it is a site where a par- ticular articulation of Being gathers, and an “I” comes to itself and comes to understand itself in relation to an intercorporeal word. I will end with a few critical remarks, remarks that do not intend to di- minish Merleau-Ponty’s accomplishments but to delimit places where Mer- leau-Ponty remains tied to ways of thinking that he seeks to overcome. These delimitations should allow us, then, to see where, together with Merleau-Ponty, one may try to move further in the quest to think without losing the natal bond with sensible Being.",

Turning to the ordinary is not as easy as the pragmatist makes it out to seem. In fact, it is impos- sible. The image of the ordinary as jagged, chaotic, and unsystematic is a representation of what cannot be represented. It projects the impasses of the enchanted ordinary onto an imagined disenchanted plane, a plane from which enchantment is to be condemned.

The ways in which Puiu depicts Viorel interacting with his physi- cal surroundings map his quotidian spatial (non-)strategies. By isolating the character in space, Aurora reveals how Viorel’s performance lacks continuity and cohesion, which shuts off the familiarity necessary for the navigation of social life. The character’s disjointed performances produce the social space he is part of, but of course this relationship is a mutual one: the post-socialist spaces of contemporary Romania delineate the limited performative repertoire available for Viorel as well. The patterns of this common dependency show an aimlessness that is different from",

That which is beneath reason elevates itself, by means of its function ‘beyond good and evil’, to what is beyond reason. But the keystone of the entire edifice is still missing. The hymn to the natural-organic order contrasts too crassly with the factual, established order.

However, in Braidotti’s view, the authority of such technology is as perverse as it is pervasive. She argues that the idea that visibility equals truth is a deep- rooted fantasy. Seeing the world, bodies, etc., is not a mechanical operation, simply registering what is objectively out there. What one sees is a product of positioning, and different accounts of the world involve political struggles over how to see and how to interpret. Braidotti argues that a politics of visual culture is required; vision implies responsibility, it is not a neutral activity, and women need to challenge the ways in which biomedical science presents its ‘advances’, looking for built-in power structures.

Later on in the text, she identifies femininity with maternity, stating that there exists an “other logic of a feminine maternal that defies normative representation” (Kristeva, IR, 259). In a patriar- chal culture, femininity and femaleness are non-normative. Beauvoir, among others, has clearly elaborated women’s position as the “other” in Western, i.e., metaphysical, thought. However much I might agree that her argument is correct in the context of contemporary society, its infusion with metaphysical and patri- archal values and structures makes Kristeva’s claim problematic on many levels.

Dillon, along with the more widely known thesis of the primacy of perception, Merleau-Ponty held to an ontological thesis of the primacy of phenomena (Dillon 1997, 51). Based on this second thesis, Merleau-­ Ponty promotes the principle of autochthonous organization, which according to Dillon, means that “the Gestalt organizes itself and generates its own internal coherence; the perceptual meaning, the configuration of parts within the Gestalt contexture, is intrinsic to the sensuous content” (Dillon 1997, 81). I point this out here, not only to indicate the similari­ ties between the self-organization of new materialisms and the autochtho­ nous organization of Merleau-Ponty, but also to develop and congeal an ontological framework built on the science studies of Barad, the political philosophy of Bennett, and the phenomenological insights of Merleau-Ponty.",

If media speculation about the ‘death of feminism’ has given rise to a body of popular texts that seek to define and diagnose the condition of postfeminism, then this book seizes on a selection of these texts in order to investigate the implied ‘afterlife’ of feminism, querying the extent to which contemporary culture is haunted by the ghosts of an undead feminism.

Affectively, contemplating this relationality elicits what Ben- nett first characterizes as “a nameless awareness” (2010, 4) of the agential power of things. However, that awareness takes on more clear-cut affective qualities in the course of Bennett’s discussion: it is a form of ecstatic marvel at the efficacy of the nonhuman world, which is arguably the default affective stance of New Materialism across the board. Other nonhuman-oriented thinkers, however, oppose both that focus on human- nonhuman entanglement and wonder as the main affect structuring philosophical engagements with materiality. For philosophers including the already mentioned Harman (2002; 2018) and Meillassoux (2008), materiality is by definition something that refrains from relation. That is one of the premises of o…",

Now, as with any communication, there is never a complete matching of codes and knowledge between participants; in the case of literary texts, the gap between writer and reader may be very wide because of the practice of preserving and valuing highly texts which are historically and culturally distant from the situation of the modern reader.

The objects of a Foucauldian power are never abandoned but rather permanently abducted by myriad governmental agencies, simultaneously conﬁned in the restricted domains of power and rendered productive in accordance with their rationalities. This form of power that Foucault has famously termed ‘biopolitics’ does not oscillate between killing and abandoning to a permanently insecure life; instead, in a formula that we ﬁnd no less disconcerting, it makes live (cf. Foucault 1990a, 138). The crucial point here is that, contrary to some overly enthusiastic readings (Hardt and Negri 2000, 2004), biopolitical power does not foster, augment, extend and nurture ‘life-as-such’ (which, in its very ‘as- suchness’ should be able to do perfectly well without biopower) but only the forms",

We are not permitted to remember 1793 and the turmoil of the French Revolution, neither its 1793 hopes nor—what is more to the point for Wordsworth—the subsequent ruin of those hopes. Wordsworth displaces all that into a spiritual economy where disaster is self-consciously transformed into the threat of disaster (\"//\"this/ Be but a vain belief,\" 50-51; my italics), and where that threat, fading into a further range of self-conscious anticipation, suddenly becomes a focus not of fear but of hope. For the mind has triumphed over its times. Thus the poem concludes in what appears to be an immense gain, but what is in reality the deepest and most piteous loss. Between 1793 and 1798 Wordsworth lost the world merely to gain his own immortal soul. The greatness of this great poem lies in the clarity and candor with which it dramatizes not merely this event, but the structure of this event. This part of my argument can be briefly concluded.

He further suggests that modern cinema may be able to reinstate our belief in this world, which I want to examine in more detail. After analysing both images and further relevant aspects of Deleuze’s writings on cinema, I proceed to the contemporary aspects of cinema.

She calls for a deeper understanding of the social changes that come along with new tech- nologies for remediating what is dearest to us—our very personal memories. In chapter 9, Anneke Smelik explores the digital remediations of the human body in science ﬁction ﬁlms and biomedical documentaries. She compares a recurring moment in both genres: the spectacular ride through a tunnel, either into cyber- space or into the human body.

On the one hand, immense and very important work has been done on Deleuze and Guattari in relation to desire and to plateaus, and to the body without organs. The possibility of building a desiring ontology that is completely different from the understanding of the sexes and sexual- ity as they have been claimed by Oedipal theories as well as societal and gendered politics has proven crucial to post-­Deleuzian scholars interested in finding alternative and more productive ways of think- ing about the nature of the body and its relations.

Perhaps, some wonder, as it is life which becomes the site of punishment, bodies are shaped and trained in ways that no life could possibly remain transpar- ent enough to herself to want to resist. A life on this view could be constrained, its possibilities for self-direction thwarted, even as the body in question becomes, grows, according to cultural valuations of that body.

However, for others this emphasis on the molecular constitution of becoming woman, combined with the tendency to separate this energy from the actual bodies of women, has been a focus of critique. The central concern is that this approach denies sex-speciﬁ c forms of agency that are important for struggles to redeﬁ ne female subjectivity (Grosz 1994, pp. 162–3). As Braidotti notes, Deleuze’s work displays a great empathy with the feminist assumption that sexual difference is the primary axis of differentiation and there- fore must be given priority. On the other hand, he also displays the tendency to dilute metaphysical difference into a multiple and undif- ferentiated becoming.

Even as Merleau-Ponty developed an explicit ontology that challenged the traditional understanding of subjects and objects, his analysis most often remains in the voice of the human sentient object.

In describing the engagement with the visible, Merleau-Ponty remarks that “[s]ince the total visible is always behind, or after, or between the aspects we see of it, there is access to it only through an experience which, like it, is wholly outside of itself” (Merleau-Ponty, The Visible and the Invisible 1968, 136).

Although Gender Trouble is framed principally in feminist terms, it has lent prestige to and has become perhaps the most inﬂuential book in this area. Derived in part from Butler’s proposal that gender is ‘performative’, ‘queer’ has been theorised, not as an alternative sexual identity so much as a critique of identity.

In recent years ‘queer’ has come to be used differently, sometimes as an umbrella term for a coalition of culturally marginal sexual self-iden- tiﬁcations and at other times to describe a nascent theoretical model",

Clarice Lispector is cited as the writer whose work has come closest to locating and conveying a feminine relation to others. Cixous describes Lispector’s texts as books “of the right distance.” Unlike the (masculine) approach which appropriates whatever he (sic) designates as other, Lispector’s writing, Cixous argues, entails a “relentless practice of deegoization” in which both self and other can coexist “as equals.” Recalling the author’s endeavor in The Book of Promethea, writing is again valued",

Byatt terms the “willed oblivion” of women in fiction (Byatt 1994, 120). They possess sexual and creative subjectivity.3 These female charac- ters also embody the efforts of early feminists, not those who organized collectively, but those who individually defied social expectations, resisted patriarchy, and “self-authorized” in order to create “authentic selves” (Lerner 47). In doing so, these women writers pick up where Victorian women writers left off, as they ask and reformulate answers to the Victorian “Woman Question.”",

However, the two differ fundamentally in that performativity is reiterative action that compels the body to become an established sex or gender upheld by cultural values as opposed to any biological predestination. Gender, thus, is realized through the ways a subject engages in the ritual of the culture’s naturalization of their body. Through exploring performativity, Butler’s text aims to ‘show that what we take to be an internal essence of gender is manufactured through a sustained set of acts, posited through the gendered stylization of the body’ (2006: xv).

As I outline in chapter 1, my contention is that this period’s filmmaking is sadomasochistic in its treatment of male characters. Through a queer reframing of Laura Mulvey’s and Gilles Deleuze’s paradigms, among others, I argue that this sadomasochism and its relationship to queerness find expression through a voyeuristic fascination with male bodies and a fetishistic one with the male face. A preoccupation with Deleuzian “facial- ity” intersects with Mulvey’s theories of gendered cinematic representation when applied to the male forms offered for spectatorial consumption. The focus of this book is on genre film, comedy and horror especially, because of genre’s close ties to the representation of masculinity, a historical trend that",

In this regard I would want to define one difference between Lauren’s perspective and mine by focusing on her distinction be- tween my engagement with “negativity’s drama of expectation and refusal” and her concern with “that muddled middle where survival and threats to it engender social forms that transform the habita- tion of negativity’s multiplicity.” Lauren’s work directs our attention to the scenic potential of what can seem an immutable relation to oneself, one’s objects, or one’s world. Her subtle readings of “social forms” and their susceptibility to change, however, differ from my own investment in reading the repetitions of the nonrelation that structures and necessitates those changes. Inherent in the prolif- eration of social forms lies what structures the social as form: the void of the nonrelation that in-­forms, which is to say, forms from",

I argue that the human aspiration to love expresses a longing for a form of communist relationality. This can be demonstrated whether or not one recognizes the communism of their own relationships. In this way, I shall muster the courage to speak of the universality of at least one communist tendency (the communist tendency of love).

The work of the philosopher Catherine Malabou in the first two decades of the twenty-­first century illuminates how Thomas seized on his body’s malleability (which religious and political authorities wanted to manipulate to shape him into a conforming Anglican subject) and decisively used it to shape himself. Drawing on Aristotelian theories of habit and on cognitive neuroscience, Malabou describes the human self as ‘plastic’: able to shape itself and hold its form, and thereby able to resist the forms that others impose on it.12 Malabou explains, ‘for Aristotle, habit implies the aptitude for change, along with the possibil- ity of preserving the modifications inherent in such a change’: the ‘twin energies’ of ‘constancy and creation’.13 Malabou depicts the plastic",

Whether they refer to a “phallocratic order” (Irigaray, 1985b, 68) or “hegemonic masculinist cultures” (Butler 1999, 7), the question feminists constantly return to is how to engage with the cultural legacy of masculine influence.

Deleuze’s words are already audible: “Desire: who, except priests, would want to call it ‘lack’?” (Deleuze & Parnet 1977, 91). Leibniz does not seem to see that the introduction of lack into every corner of desire, and into its satisfaction as well, makes lack into something paradoxically excessive, introducing a ‘primordial Discord’ (Lacan 1949, 96) into the relationship of the human being to the world. Constant disquiet is part of a “healthy man’s appetite ... unless it amounts to that discomfort which unsettles us and gives us a tormenting obsession with the idea of whatever it is that we are without” (Leibniz 1765, 189). For Sartre and especially Lacan, “a tormenting obsession with the idea of whatever it is that we are without” seems to be intrinsic to desire.

Currie maintains that it is in relation to contemporary ﬁction in particular that such an analysis of time is necessary, speciﬁcally in the light of ‘the strange temporal structures that have developed in the novel in recent decades’ (p. 1). Crucial to Currie’s account is the notion of the ‘anticipation of retrospection’ (p. 29) – derived and developed from Peter Brooks (1984, p. 23) – ‘which is involved in all narrative, and which offers the beginnings of a theory which connects the temporality of reading with the temporality of living’ (pp. 30–1).

As Renaud Barbaras argues in “The Three Senses of Flesh,” Merleau-Ponty’s own ambiguity concerning the meaning of “flesh” has led to two opposing interpretations. The first one reads la chair as a faithful retranslation of the Husserlian idea of Leib as the experiential body, but then we find ourselves with the strange concept of a “flesh of the world”: the reversible structure of embodiment (my own body is both sentient and sensed) cannot be extended to the world at large without turning the world itself into a sentient being (some aspects of this hypothesis…",

For Kristeva, bodily experiences of language occur through the interac- tion of the Symbolic and the Semiotic. The Symbolic relies on the regulations of rational discourse. The Semiotic is less tangible; it is the non-representa- tional part of the signifying process located in the pre-oedipal phase of the child’s development. At this stage, pulsions—energies that move through the infant’s body—structure its life and articulate a mobile and ephemeral totality, which Kristeva calls the semiotic chora. She borrows the term chora from Plato’s Timaeus, where it denotes “an essentially mobile and extremely provisional articulation constituted by movements and their ephemeral sta- ses” (Revolution 25). Kristeva notes that the chora, which she associates with “rupture,” “articulation,” and “rhythm,” “precedes evidence, verisi-",

Rather than the philosophical conservatism of meta- physical form, Malabou suggests, the accident reveals that form is not",

Why be reluctant to attribute a soul to a mute stone, a falling leaf, a tattered quilt, a painting of a trecento saint? The animism that has coursed through so many differ- ent systems of beliefs in so many times and places is very often forsaken, even abjured, in the name of historical knowledge. Scholars are far guiltier of this renunciation, of course, than shamans, poets, or great-­aunts. Where does the animate absence hide? In what corners might it still hover? How do we know it’s there? No whispers are audible, no sudden metamorphoses occur before our in- quisitive eyes. We nonetheless recognize it because of the in- adequacies we intuit in its quiet presence. We just haven’t said enough, or uttered the right charmed phrases, to bring it forth. No matter how tangled and well-­researched …",

The constituted otherness of woman has been subsumed into a discourse of masculine sameness. The only representations of women possible within this economy are duplication, opposition, or insertion. The masculine has spoken the universal on behalf of woman by erasing her from discursive history. In Hegel and Heidegger, the relation of Being to non­ Being implicitly relegated woman to the position of nothingness in an ontological hierarchy; psychoanalysis, in its description of linguistic signification, makes this identification complete by excluding woman from the circulation of phallic meaning.

Then, though Goethe does not explicitly say this, it is through comprehen- sion of that whole as virtual, that I am able to realize the relation of the specific other to my own presence, now also more clearly given than naive sensory perception can ever instruct me.

Who among depression sufferers could resist cultural tropes that link their disorder to artistic and intellectual achievement, to creativity, and to a profounder understanding and wisdom than is vouchsafed to more sanguine folk? In turn, who among the well could not welcome a return to more positive charac- terizations of those who endure depressive suffering? Some counter to the negative stereotypes (with their sequelae in self-stigma and discrimination), and some com- pensation for that suffering, can surely only be applauded.

In this way, the life of form is not preformed or predetermined, but capable of a future that escapes and outstrips its own present. This possibility, however, is not strictly subject to our power—we are also subject to it. From this crucial insight of Malabou’s philosophy, Durán examines how this capacity and vulnerability to be unexpectedly shaped or formed by a future that we did not see coming is the wellspring of a central motif in Malabou’s thought, disaffection: we do not know what can or will happen and therefore we are powerless to what occurs. Yet, while this may appear to disempower us, Durán argues that disaffection can be a concept or affect through which we can conceive of alternate futures: if we are not attached to the present, and the future is not predicated on any past, who is to say our disaffection, our",

Their subjective character in these circumstances is, therefore, no indication of what experience is like for us in other situations. Merleau-Ponty develops Heidegger’s account by viewing our existence in the world as primarily ‘pre-objective’, that is, as that of embodied agents manipulating things unreflectively, rather than that of subjects set over against the objects of our experience. Intentionality is in the first place, therefore, the ‘motor intentionality’ of my body acting, as it were, autonomously upon objects. It is motor intentionality which gives us, literally as well as metaphorically, a grasp on objects, so that they are perceived as complete things, even though they project only a two- dimensional image on our retinas.

Indeed, most of the novel consists of Pamela’s conﬂicts with other characters over the kind of reduc- tion they will practice. Most typical is the kind she has already practiced on her- self, namely, division. Division is a useful mode of reduction because it allows other characters to fantasize about ﬁnding some consistent character at the heart of another person. This way of forming an identity is dangerous not only for Pamela but also for Richardson. After Defoe and the opera seria, the novelist’s problem was how to represent Pamela’s interiority. Richardson ﬁnds an antithetical method—Pamela, as I said,personiﬁes her heart—but ﬁnds that his tools to hand are strangely open to manipulation by one of his own characters.

Similarly, I am suggesting that Anglophone novels deploy spectral content and form to reflect lived realities of capitalist development and resulting environmental inequalities and to incorporate ways of knowing that account for ongoing interactions with deceased ancestors and the animate voices of nonhuman matter; their narration of spectral experience does not necessarily convey a rejection of realist representation, but instead invites further attention to how definitions of and debates about realism participate in adjudicating whose experience of the world counts as real and the consequences those judgments carry for how we perceive and respond to social and environmental crises.

Monsters, goddesses and cyborgs do have some kind of connection, some kind of kinship, of course.And Haraway has long been interested in the ideas of kinship, relationality, affinity; she has wanted to find different ways of thinking about connections and relations that aren’t based on bloodline and family, in part to sidestep the pitfalls of psychoanalysis invoked to think the family in theory and in therapy, as well as to avoid the reductions of biologism – and also to arrive at a more open and pro- ductive set of encounters and coalitions which aren’t about surrender, mastery or ownership, nor about totalizing identities, about two becoming",

Those who do not die well in this era of custom deaths, then, have only them- selves to blame. It is no surprise that managerial behaviors are prompted by the expe- rience of abjection; technologies for taking categorical approaches to chaotic processes constitute, in themselves, an aesthetics that defines popular Western culture.

How indeed might life live if it is locked within the limits which biopoliticization places de facto on human life, whether by liberal democratic society or by fascist dictatorship? In this light, the conclusion of Agamben’s study of homo sacer in which he evokes a variety of nameless terrains and biopolitical cases to generate the ways and forms of a new biopolitics appears fruitless.19 Biopolitical life, even when purged of what Agamben considers to be the toxic exclusion of zoe, remains exclusively intra-",

Most importantly, the idea of feminine chastity which was emphasized by Petrarch and the Renaissance Neoplatonists acquired a new and unexpected significance when associated with a woman who was possessed of both political and spiritual authority. Attitudes to love derived from Petrarchan love poetry and Florentine Neoplatonic philosophy were widely disseminated among western courtly societies during the European Renaissance. Although, as I shall show, these discourses differed in several respects, both systems combined a curiously paradoxical conception of a beloved woman with emphasis upon the search of a male lover for a new identity. The female beloved was declared by poets and writers to be the true object of the processes of emotional enquiry delineated in their discourses of love, and was accorded an exaggerated emotional and imaginative",

This implies that assemblages always exist in populations, however small, the populations generated by the repeated occurrence of the same processes.

In “Four Theses on Posthuman Feminism,” Braidotti thinks through anthropocene feminism as a form of posthuman feminism, beginning with the thesis that “feminism is not a humanism.” For Braidotti, feminism is resolutely antihumanist and, she adds, anti-­Eurocentric. Her second thesis, “Anthropos is off-­center,” offers a zoe-­centric relational ontology that decenters humanism not from the outside but “from philosophies of radical immanence, vital materialism, and the feminist politics of locations.” Proclaiming zoe “the ruling principle,” her third thesis urges her fellow feminists “to",

While this introductory chapter focuses specifically on the tension between orgasm and plateau, the book as a whole inquires more widely into the relations and tensions between pleasure and desire, and between human and nonhuman sexuality as they appear in Deleuze’s writing. At the same time, it weighs his philosophical understanding of pleasure and desire against a number of contem- porary as well as historical Western theories and representations of sexuality. The role of pleasure, Deleuze and Guattari write in A Thousand Plateaus, is that of the negotiator between the subject and desire, a way for persons to ‘find themselves’. Unlike the associations with a temporary escape that come with the ‘petite mort’, orgasm, for Deleuze and Guattari, becomes nothing but ‘a mere fact, a rather deplorable one, in relation to desire in pursuit of its principle’ (Deleuze and Guattari 2004: 173).

It is this confrontation of one’s own mortality, within the understanding that the last man or woman faces the possibility of dying alone, which ultimately results in a challenge for the last person in narrating his or her experience. To aid in the exploration concerning the relationship between death and solitude, the paper considers two works of Emmanuel Levinas, God, Death, and Time and Time and the Other. In God, Death, and Time Levinas acknowledges that one’s rela­ tion to death is, “made up of the emotional and intellectual repercussions of the knowledge of the death of others” (Levinas 2000, 10).

For Fisher, Cixous’ fiction proves the theoretical premises announced in The Laugh of the Medusa, particularly her declaration that the writer’s responsibility is not merely to create works of art but to offer up “works of being.” Animate rather than static “works of being” do not arrest life in verbal taxonomies but offer us—through evocative portraiture—the gift of life itself. In the first of three essays in section II to deal with Cixous’ relation to other writers, Judith Still explores the theoretical relationship of a feminine gift economy to sexual difference in Cixous’ work and Derrida’s Given Time: I (1992).

Indeed, it is important for Griffiths to show that philosophers and folk psy- chologists offer the same account; that is to say they do so when philosophers rely upon conceptual analysis, as do the propositional attitude theorists. 19.

Griffiths stipulates that a number of philosophers are participating in a research program; he claims that those research programs are degener- ating; and he identifies core commitments—i.e. conceptual analysis as a methodology—as being flawed in order to show that the research program has to fail.

THE MYSTICISM OF HORROR The limit or failure of thought to positively conceive of the divine that is expressed in apophatic mysticism correlates to a similar form of thought- failure exhibited in genre horror.

Semiological research into literature proceed­ ed unevenly along these three axes; and it was not until the crucial work of Kristeva and Derrida in the later 1960s that it was possible to present the synthesis and reconceptualisation of their insights. Barthes describes these three attentions: Every sign includes or implies three relationships. First, an interior relation, which joins signifier to signified; then two exterior relations: the first is virtual, it unites the sign to a specific reserve of other signs, from which it is extracted to be inserted into discourse; the second is actual, it joins the sign to the other signs of the enuncia­",

Again, the human and the non-human are tragically interconnected; any attempt to apportion blame will soon be lost in a riddle of chance and speculation.

As Ducrot and Todorov put it, ‘what all the Saussurians retain in common, however, is that the linguistic unit, through its phonic and semantic aspects, always refers back to all the other units and that it is impossible either to hear or to comprehend a sign without entering into the global play of the language.’ (Ducrot and Todorov, 1979:19).

Wilder- son, Saidiya Hartman, and Calvin Warren; and what I call the “extinctual nihilism” of Jean- François Lyotard and Ray Brassier. This chapter argues that by bringing Mainländer’s work into dialogue with these contempo- rary pessimisms it might be logically strengthened, historically informed, and more pointedly directed in order to become a practical and effective model of ethical, social, and political normativity. I conclude all of this by exploring in greater detail what can be practically gained from the kind of speculatively driven ethical pessimism",

I stress the cinematic effect of reader as viewer; the poem is driven by images and their emotional correlatives in an almost symbolistic way.

Because of the anxieties associat- ed with castration posed by the woman’s image on screen, Mulvey posits, Hitchcock accommodates the male desire to see her fetishized and controlled in the course of the narrative. Mulvey’s analysis raises several issues vital to any discussion of fear and desire and attraction and repulsion in Hitchcock’s males.

This too, however, is not substantiated, neither in the text of the seminar, nor in the wider development of his theory. It is in ﬂ agrant contradiction with the fact that Lacan had always put the emphasis on the object pole of desire.

I want to establish that semiotics can be used as a tool for uncovering signifiers of Japanese mythology hidden in this particular pop culture medium and that visual literacy or cultural literacy can be developed as an outcome. That is why semiotics serves as a methodology of analysis in this book. The French semiotician Barthes (1972) argued that pop culture is an encompassing system that recycles socially encoded meanings of Western culture for commercial purposes. Certainly, he did not intend to assert that profit making is the only goal for which pop culture uses encoded messages. Nor did he mean to contend that embedding symbolic meaning in the mass media is a sui generis phenomenon of Western culture.…",

These, the so-called savage, barbarian and civilised formations correspond to pre-State, State and capitalist (para-State) social formations.

On the one hand, death can take the form of a substance continuing to exist but becoming incapable of producing certain local manifestations such as movement, affect, and cognition. On the other hand, death can take the form of absolute death, where entropy completely sets in and the substance is utterly destroyed such that it is no longer able to enlist other objects in maintaining its own organization and the other objects of which the entity was once composed now go their separate ways autonomously, enjoying their existence elsewhere.

Bearing in mind the multiplicity of spatio-temporal worlds also at stake in Uexküll’s model, as we saw above, this also returns us to the question of the Umwelt. For there is a rich set of resonances to be traced between Uexküll’s ‘pluralist ontology’ and Deleuze’s thinking of the time-image. Deleuze writes, in Cinema 2, of cinema’s opening to ‘a pluralist cosmology, where there are not only different worlds [. . .], but where one and the same event is played out in these different worlds, in incompatible versions’.105 Though the connection is not made explicit, this ‘pluralist cos- mology’ speaks to (and is possibly even shaped by) Uexküll’s ‘pluralist ontol-",

I oppose this position by arguing that, instead of a being-toward-death, almost everyone has what I call a “being-to-overcome-death.” In our sheer existence, we direct ourselves more to the preserving and continuing of life than to any devastating anxiety—which may also be present occasionally—about its eventual destruction.

With the concept of the lived body, Merleau-Ponty uncovers the fluid spatiality and orientation of the acting body, infused with meaning, understanding, and expressiveness in gait and gesture. Since consciousness is bodily, such a subject is thoroughly in the world, which always outruns her or him. Beauvoir identifies ambiguity as integral to an ethics bv which we might grasp the genuine conditions of our lives.

Moreover, the beholder becomes frightened by the sight of the wounds and suffering of another, which, observed by the beholder’s own frightened gaze, are turned inward to her or his body. To observe the suffering of others blends with a great fear concerning our own human form, the dread of the possibility that our face, too, might turn into a similar formless mass. We are thus subjected to the affective power of images which, as Jill Bennett suggests, “have the capacity to address the spectator’s own bodily memory; to touch the viewer who feels rather than simply sees the event, drawn into image through a process of affect contagion” (2005: 36).

In an experimental theology, “fermentation” might well be taken as a technical, theologi- cal term of central importance. In addition, transcendence, understood as a kind of fer- mentation, must also be uncoupled from the notion of “pu- rity.” Transcendence still marks difference, distance, and resistance, but because it marks them only locally, rela- tively, and provisionally, it parts ways with purity. If the gods exist in Latour’s pluriverse, they are not pure, uncon- ditioned, or exceptional. They are not free from the neces- sity of translation, negotiation, and compromise. Nor are they free from a need for techniques, instruments, technol- ogies, calculations, and metrologies. The gods too, like every other object, must receive the resistant availability of the proliferating multitude as the gift that it is. Latour has no patience for those who, in the name of",

According to Lacan, the seductiveness of the mirror image’s alluring wholeness directs our desires toward an illusion of totality and away from the erratic surges of energy that are our innate experience of the self. This experience imprints on us our lifelong relationship with the beautiful image and becomes in turn the analogue of our relationship with language and with the primary illusion of inherent meaning. To summarize in a generalization simplified for the purpose of clarity in this discussion, the artist’s image, according to the Lacanian view, seduces us, directing our desires toward a consuming passion for our “ego ideal,” dooming us to solipsism while we yearn for the illusion of wholeness. Viewed within this framework, art traps the conscious mind in a net of",

Even compassionate photojournalism has to meet two different criteria; our surrealist way of looking at photographs and our belief that photographs can give truthful information about important events. Sontag gives as an example W. Eugene Smith’s photograph of a dying boy on his mother’s lap (from the Minamata series documenting the mercury poisoning of a Japanese fishing village).

The ‘signiﬁed’ Barthes refers to is the stable meaning or concept which any method of analysis requires if it is to present itself as scientiﬁc or objective. Kristeva’s attack on notions of stable signiﬁcation centred on the transformation of Saussure’s idea of semiology, or what was increasingly called semiotics. Semiotics in mid-1960s France argued for its own objectivity by employing Saussurean concepts such as langue (the system) to stabilize the ‘signiﬁeds’ it studied. Myths, oral cultural traditions, literary texts, indeed any cultural text, can be scientiﬁcally analyzed, so structuralist semiotics argued, because at any one moment signiﬁers exist and function within a synchronic system which provides determinable sig…",

These mechanisms charac- terize disciplinary practices that go along with the formation and development of the human sciences since the eighteenth century. Foucault exposes them, for instance, in the model of the panopticon: Single cells divide the subjects that thus can become objects of scientific experiments and observation that may lead to classify forms of behavior and other things.

The reader is then left wondering whether the dis- missal of incarnational thought through a commentary on the use of ﬂesh and incarnation in the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty and others, has, once again, taken us back to ‘phenomenological religiosity’ and to the problem of differentiating ‘confessional’ and philosophical writing.

The model illustrated by Smith’s essay draws upon experimental data, and it employs the methods and explanations of the natural sciences. The model illustrated by Bruun Vaage’s chapter appeals to experiential and “textual” evidence, and it employs the methods and explanations of the humanities. Cognitivism, we claim, is a big enough tent to house both models of theory building. In the fourth and ﬁnal section of the introduction, we brieﬂy summarize the rest of the contributions to the book.

Although Levinas does not glimpse the erotic abysses that find expression as excess and madness, his ethics of eros points unambiguously to the negativity of the Other: sacrosanct, atopic otherness, which, in today’s increasingly narcissistic society, is vanishing. Moreover, Levinas’s ethics of eros can be reformulated as resistance to the economic reification of the Other. Otherness is not consumable differ­ ence. Capitalism is eliminating otherness wholesale in order to subordinate everything to consumption. Eros, however, represents an asymmetrical relationship to the Other. As such, it interrupts the exchange rate. Otherness admits no bookkeeping. It does not appear in the balance of debt and credit.",

For these thinkers, all thought and experience is affec- tive, that is, nonconscious, nonverbal, and “germinal … moved by the force of time to express powers of existence in coming action” (Massumi 2009, 1). Affect encourages engagement with the concepts of resonance, non- linearity, modulation, relationality, and, as this book suggests, rhythmicity. The latter, as it is discussed below, is understood as a halted moment in the event that points to its subsistence beyond perception’s actual registries and the setting of subjective experience. Affect complicates the question of subjectivity and challenges the assumption that there are already-formed subjects, identities, and essences in the world. Affect suggests an “empty- ing” of perception from conscious, cognized activity, pointing to the ability of a body to feel in a vaguely sentient manner.…",

The imagery becomes surrealist at times as if Eliot had entered the region of the unconscious in search of a solution for the wasteland and its miserable actors. Death is the ﬁrst image, seen to be something in the nature of a sacriﬁce. But it is a death without redemption. The opening imagery suggests Christ’s passion and death: The Gethsemane, the prison, the trial, the Golgotha. At this stage, it is worth noticing that “April is the cruelest month” (1) because this is the Easter/cruciﬁxion season. It seems evident that Eliot has now turned to Christianity to solve the problem of the wasteland. Yet Christianity seems not to be convincing. The cruciﬁxion might",

She has, she realises, always contented herself with loving (1991a: 104). But Promethea insists that, if this is to truly be a book of love, i.e., a book of divine love, Cixous must write that she too is loved. In so insisting that Cixous write that she too is love Promethea provides the occasion for her to reﬂect on the structure of love, in terms both of reciprocity and of mutuality. As I discussed in Chapter 2, reciprocity and mutuality are typically conﬁgured as occurring when two parties engage in loving each other: ‘I love you’ evokes an ‘I love you too’ – no blurring of the boundaries of subjectivity here.

Surveying the main identificatory models proposed in the past, I show that empathy, like the concept of abjection I develop in Chapter 1, does not depend on sympathy or the specificities of the body in question, but on corporeal intelligibility. Hanich’s work on the forms of mimicry that comprise somatic empathy is also useful in determining the moment of encounter with images of mutilation as an instance of sensation mimicry.

The binary oppositions that Mulvey deployed in ‘Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema’ equate masculinity with activity, sadism, and voyeurism and femininity with passivity, masochism, and exhibition- ism.

As Braidotti shows, via Deleuze and Guattari, the post- structuralist critique of the humanistic subject forces us to challenge the anthropocentrism built into conceptions of the human subject. This anthropocentrism, she notes, ‘prevents us from relinquishing the categorical divide between bios and zoe’ (Braidotti 2006: 40). Braidotti’s understanding of posthumanism is built on the possibility of affirming the vitalist power of zoe and provides a way of transpos- ing modes of sexualisation and naturalisation into productive force (Braidotti 2006: 42). However, and to return to the emergence of ‘sexuality’ as a concept in the early nineteenth century, this concept does not affirm vitalism but presents, rather, a distinctly human sexu- al…",

He critiques Chast’s memoir along similar lines: “There is a disjunct between her characteristic style and her subjects” (372fn). Going further than most, Couser pronounces what he calls “visual abstractions” – indeed, any deviation from what he deems a realistic style in comics about death and debility – “counterproductive” (356).

As Elizabeth Grosz clarifies: “Matter and life become, and become undone. They transform and are transformed” (5). These new ways of “becoming” lead up feminist theory to broaden its methodology. Mainly studying the function of “inhuman,” including animals, plants, and machines, con- temporary posthuman feminism considers “before, beyond, and after the human” to remind “the limits of the human” (11–12).

We are thus caught up in what Levinas designates as the domain of the political, where it is necessary to interrogate and calculate intersubjective relations in order to achieve social justice. Levinas 's observation does not, however, entail that he renounces his no- tion of a singular, ethical encounter with the Other, which would precede the political. Instead, he holds that the political community should be guided by the respect for the Other, who here turns out to be no one Jess than God the Father, recalling us to \"the human fraternity.\" Even if one disregards the theologico-patriarchal humanism in Levinas's line …",

(1) Cosmic horror ddefies easy categorization or indeed even boundaries. As Roger Luckhurst states, ‘the weird concerns liminal things, in between states, transgressions always on the verge of turning into something else’ (Lovecraft, Classic, xvi). At the heart of cosmic horror are the autoimmune metaphors: survival, transmutation, death and extinction (each will be dealt with here).

It is unclear exactly where the contemporary debates in negative theology and philosophy will take us, but it is important that we find out—otherwise, silence threatens to be nothing but the end of philosophy, and philosophy threatens to be pretty much anything.

This emphasis on the embodied nature of what Rosi Braidotti calls `being-a-woman' is one shared by a number of recent theorists. Sexual difference, they argue, is an embodied, and therefore a foundational difference. Being a woman means, argues Christine Battersby, a `shared positioning vis-aÁ-vis the founding . . . categories that inform our notions of individuality, self and ``person- hood'' '(1998: 16). It means living in, and with, unequal relations of power which are at once material and social, and symbolic ± a matter of language and representation.

If this or that object were to be undergo- ing truly Protean changes at each instant of its career, then we would either fail to recognize such a strange “object” altogether or, at the very best, we would have to achieve such a recognition by relying upon the object’s determinate surroundings, with their shapes, sizes, colors, and so on.

Yet the later Merleau-Ponty, Lyotard and Levinas have already confronted it and offered a number of fruitful suggestions on how to resolve it. The later Merleau-Ponty develops a notion of the ‘flesh’ as the common element between the subject and object of experience, drawing upon the fact that it is through the body that things act upon us, so that our bodies can be both subject and object, as when we touch ourselves. We can, perhaps, reinterpret this suggestion in terms of an appeal to the body as a causal mechanism whose operation can nonetheless provide us with reasons, rather than merely stimuli, because we each feel the effects of things on the body in the same way, and, consequently, as making our reactions intelligible.

It is impossible to work through the essays collected in The Resistance to Theory or Aesthetic Ideology without regarding them in an important sense as the extended dismantling of the premises and promises of the aesthetic—this “seductive notion” full",

Obviously, the ultimate goal of the theorists translated here is not the dialectical integration of the many discourses they cite. Rather, they offer a way of overcoming our often limited perspective on the various agents struggling on today’s political scene.

I have always loved feminist theory for its utopianism, and I hope to contribute to the tradition of dogged optimism that allows its practi- tioners to understand and experience life differently. In this spirit, there are three overlapping strands to this work, all of which seek to allow for a different kind of feminist political thinking: the laying out of Western feminist storytelling in this intellectual space I call home; the exploration of the political grammar of feminist narratives that make up these stories and their consistency with other stories about feminism and gender; the sketching out of interventions that start at the level of political grammar and propose ways of breaking open dominant narrative forms.

Love of earth, if not of world, is enjoined from many an alternative pulpit.1 Love of world or even of earth must rest on something ﬁrmer than imagination, however, if it is to distinguish itself from all manner of fantasies and free-associational literary pensées and justify itself as a modus vivendi. Where are we to turn for such a justiﬁcation? From our own standpoint within the Western tradition it is still to reason that we must appeal for a degree of epistemological reassurance. Reason is…",

My contention — one not entirely absent in the existing literature on Levinas, but here elaborated in much greater detail — i that for Levinas ethics is the way to metaphysics, that 'ethics' is the phenom- enological elaboration or experiential attestation of a more fundamental metaphysical claim that would reassert the necessity of a thinking of 'tran- scendence' as a first principle.

As the statue of Venus kills the bridegroom, the very danger which the scholar had consistently seen and which had determined his theory about the statue becomes real. The fan- tastic translates the Parisian’s neurosis into reality and thereby ra- tionalizes the narrator’s hitherto irrational fears both of love and of the Venus. It shows that they are in fact justified. Rather than sub- stituting a merely hypothetical danger for a real, instinctual one, the fantastic adds a second real danger to the existing libidinal one in the form of the Venus-bride-killer.

Drawing on Rosi Braidotti’s (1993, 2003) analytic of the ‘nomadic subject’ and her cartographic meth- odology, this chapter thwarts the conceptualization of the Jihadi Bride as a unitary subject, instead reappraising her within advanced capitalism and fractured postmodern reality as a complex entity reconnecting her with her bodily subjectivity and suppressed pleasures. It re-centres her through the screen cultures of the post-digital landscape. This alternative reading releases her from the shackles of religiosity to recreate her as someone capable of experiencing and producing desire enmeshed with the consumption and ex- periential economies of the screen.

He writes: We shall give the name relation of exception to the extreme form of relation by which something is included solely through its exclusion. The figure that is included solely through its exclusion is what Agamben names “bare life”. This is a life that is “separated and excluded from itself—only a bare life”. The problem of the relationship between mad- ness and reason in the twentieth century commences with three dis- courses that revolve around this notion of an inclusive exclusion. Madness can only be understood and included within rational discourse through its exclusion as beyond the realm of understanding; as a form of bare life, an empty space that can only be marked by an absence.

For this means the renunciation of being all; it entails valuing and elaborating the limitations which are concomitant with embodiment, This thought, that embodiment brings limitations with it, is not new, but these limitations have not been valued positively in the history of philosophy. For the resistance against the limitations brought about by embodiment has been one of the driving motives of the philosophical, metaphysical traditions. It has generated the desire to transcend these limitations and has inspired the thought-movement to cut the sensible and corporeal from the Intelligible and spiritual, matter from form.",

Yaeger charts several varieties of the female sublime, finding instances of it in such diverse writers as Elizabeth Bishop, Eudora Welty, and Nikki Giovanni. I would suggest that the quest for a female sublime shapes several of Lispector ’s texts, and perhaps none as insistently as The Stream of Life. In Lispector’s hands, this mode does not fol- low exactly any of the three patterns Yaeger identifies as “three strategies the woman writer uses to harn…",

It is also free of a binary logic. For Haraway, the “cyborg myth is about transgressed boundaries, potent fusions, and dangerous possibili- ties which progressive people might explore as one part of needed political work” (154). Haraway provides “an argument for pleasure in the confusion of boundaries,” and adds that “From the point of view of pleasure in [ . . . ] potent and taboo fusions, made inevitable by the social relations of science and technology, there might indeed be a feminist science” (150, 173). Sci- ence fiction provides a “catalogue of promising and dangerous monsters who help redefine the pleasures and politics of embodiment and feminist writing” (179). However, an analysis of how these fictions “redefine the",

And this occurs long before conscious awareness of the sexual difference becomes something to interpret. Little girls know that their genital sexual parts are hidden or enclosed within the folds of their skin—clitoris, vagina, labia lips—in imaginary comparison between themselves and little boys. And these parts are not experienced as breaks or cuts, but as parts of a whole that relate to jouissance. Rather, what is “natural” to one becomes an image of the measurable or visible as a standard for the norm, that, in turn, is equated with social reality. In mathematical terms, one could describe imaginary awareness of the sexual difference as having the weight or dimension of the line, whose topological density is that of an absolute real, a unary trait, or unbroken line.

An important strand of this politically committed early Lacanian film theory was the work of the 1970s feminist film theorists, particularly Laura Mulvey’s influ- ential notion of the male gaze. Mulvey drew links between the mirror stage and the psychoanalytic concept of voyeurism to model the way in which the cinema uses visual pleasure to oppressively enforce socially constructed differences in gender subjectivity. Extremely influential in the developing field of cinema studies, the work of the early Lacanian theorists sparked a great deal of critical debate and even animosity.

The punctum discloses itself only to gazing that lingers in con­ templation. In contrast, a sequence of images forces the observer, as Barthes puts it, to ‘continuous voracity’. The punctum eludes the con­ suming, ravenous gaze in which no ‘pensiveness’ dwells.32 Moving to the chapter ‘The Society of Information’, Han comes to reflect on Plato’s allegory of the cave.

As we have already seen in the chap- ter on Ernie Gehr, for Warburg images contain pagan energies preserved as ghosts waiting to be re-awakened at a later time. Thus, for Agamben, repetition—another vital term in his philosophy—comes to mean not a reoccurrence of the same but rather “the possibility of what was.”31 One could perhaps say that in Agamben’s use of the concept, repetition loses its mimetic quality to acquire a creative dimension.

In relation to the Surrealists, Blanchot speaks of a rhet- oric that becomes material such that we can be caught up in a storm or swamp of words that have values beyond our own, like an ocean that ap- pears at one moment to be convulsed by tumults and at the next to be as calm and expansive as a desert [PF: 94/89]. It is at this point that the trap becomes most difficult to avoid, because language has become as autono- mous as the commodity and so is at risk of losing itself to an alienated and alienating objectivity. Language in the literary work, as for the artwork in general, would then operate at the point of almost succumbing to this sheer objectivity, only differentiating itself from it by virtue of the enigma of its own appearance, which has arisen out of and as contingency itself. And in doing so it thereby provides a critique of the commodity-form by demon- strating its lack of totality—a potential, inevitably never fully realized in",

It literally means `conversation', but also indicates that which is perpetually `in-between'. The aim of this chapter is to intensify tendencies already evident in the novel so as to explore the impersonal forces it releases. Ultimately, it is a question of exploring what Deleuze calls `style' (the point at which writing becomes `gaseous'), with the hope of providing new ways of activating and evaluating Deleuzian concepts. Here, it is the concept of the `event' which comes to the fore and suggests itself as a form of entretien. The event is the `middle' which literature inhabits as a site in which to create fiction. Fiction in this sense is not opposed to the true, but rather depends upon the `powers of the false'.4 …",

Levinas makes his challenge to the philosophical privileging of self within the context of the centrality of metaphors of light and vision in the history of Western philosophy. As is the case with Merleau-Ponty, much of Levinas’s work is an engagement with and response to the phenomenological systems of Husserl and Heidegger. Levinas engages critically with the ideal existence of consciousness in Husserl’s phenomenology and with Being in Heidegger’s phenomenology.

In recent years, the widely inﬂuential critiques of visual pleasure that dominated feminist theories of representation in the 1970s and 1980s have themselves been criticized for discounting emotional and corporeal experi- ence, along with any positive beneﬁts to passive and pleasurable looking. Indeed, some thirty- ﬁve years after Mulvey’s ﬁeld- launching…",

But if the image is referred, as it should be, to its specific being as simulacrum (and not to mimesis), and eternity to the One qua integral virtual, we can understand that, for Deleuze as well, for Deleuze above all, the essence of time consists in expressing the eternal. As Deleuze forcefully puts it, the time-images, which can be situated in the creative power of the All, are \"volume-images which are beyond movement itself\" (Cinema 1, p. 1 1). This clearly underlines that the profound being of time, its truth, is immobile. But how are we to think this immobile totalization that founds the mobility of time?

If noir affect is a mode of con temporary culture, melo- dramatic affect may trump it as the pre sent’s dominant mode. In a world in which right- wing strong men (starting with Donald Trump himself) are openly enjoying power and propagating sexual vio lence and in which re- spectability regularly is undone by exposed secrets, melodrama may indeed be the acting mode.

For this reason, the term ‘embodiment’, as it appears in the history of post- minimalist sculpture, and more recently in that of installation and virtual art, is understood to refer to the spectator’s state of quasi-immersion in the artwork.

Her later work paid attention to cultural experiences of otherness that would undermine the subject who is set against a world to be known (Kristeva, 1988/1991).

The look, which goes by way of the symbolic, is more dangerous than touch, which goes by way of the body, for it produces the Platonic dilemma of doubling ‘where everything secondary is always inferior in relation to the primary’ (1992: 40).

I am thinking, for instance, of Ben Woodard’s “dark vitalism” (2012), Reza Negarestani’s “dark materialism” (2008), and Eugene Thacker’s “horror of philosophy” (2011). For these thinkers, the world-without-us is alien and actively hostile to human life and thought. If nothing else, such projects are further signs that we are beginning to think speculatively and cosmologically again—after a century in which, with the lonely exception of Whitehead, such efforts were viewed with suspicion and derision.",

It may be tactical, they argue, for women to have a 'molar politics'. And this molar politics would be concerned with a specifically female subjectivity. However, they go on to insist that this female subject ought not act as a ground or limit to the women's movement. To embrace; the female subject as a foundation or schema for action would lead to ressentiment: the slavish subordination of action to some high ideal (Deleuze 1983: 123).

As is well known, throughout his career Lacan borrows models, ideas, and terminology from other disciplines to theorize sub¬ jectivity in increasingly complex ways. These disparate models and their accompanying terminology come and go with such dizzying frequency in Lacan’s work that we would be mistaken in too readily hypostasizing any one of them. For instance, when furnishing his seminar audience with an optical model for grasping the imaginary order’s functioning, Lacan makes clear that this model of the inverted bouquet represents “a substitute for the mirror-stage” (SI 74). The model of the inverted bouquet offers a different way—perhaps at the moment it is introduced",

The ﬂesh is in this sense an ‘‘element’’ of Being.’6 Merleau-Ponty goes to great pains to expand his notion of perception from individual sense reception to a broader notion of the visible that evokes the body’s touch, motility, and expression and coalesces it into a ‘style of being’. He thus explains the discrete body’s entrenchment in and communicability with the world at large. Interestingly, this relation between the body and the world, between oneself and another, between vision and touch – a relation that Merleau-Ponty descr…",

He is clearly, unequivocally, a subject. In diegetic terms, yes, but every character on screen is also an object of the cinema spectator's gaze. Mulvey bypasses the evident truth of this by claiming that the spectator fantasises with the active male on screen, shares through fantasy in his power, which is the power to be active, to subjugate the villain, to demand the female's passivity as a complement to his hetero- sexual activity. Yet, in less cerebral terms, the cinema spectator, male, female or 'masculinised', looks at the powerful male on screen. The admiring gaze, on which male action cinema depends as obviously as fine art, can easily be converted into, or become one with, the desiring gaze. Kno…",

The unbinding of the human, the loss of identity and of linguistic capacities, makes it infantile and undignified, but it does not reduce it to the pure subsistence of naked life. That is part of what is terrible about it. ‘Man is the indestructible that can be destroyed.’37 It is instructive to compare Agamben with Foucault here, an ostensi­ bly crucial influence on Homo Sacer. The first thing to ask is this: where could a concept like ‘bare life’ possibly fit within Foucault’s discourse? The answer, of course, is nowhere: the concept is too unwieldy, too abstract, too metaphysical to work in a properly Foucauldian register. If Agamben can be understood as continuing Foucault’s project in Homo Sacer (bearing in mind that the basic problem of the text turns up in Agamben as early as Language and Death, which is framed in",

If it is true to say that much recent work in cultural studies has investigated bad feelings (shame, disgust, hate, fear, and so on), it might be useful to take good feeling as our starting point, without presuming that the distinction between good and bad will always hold. Of course, we cannot conﬂate happiness with good feeling. As Darrin McMahon (2006) has argued in his monumental history of happiness, the association of happiness with feeling is a modern one, in circulation from the eighteenth century onward. If happiness now evokes good feeling, then we can consider how feelings participate in making things good. To explore happiness using the language of a√ect is to conside…",

Despite the apparent contradiction with the characterization of Antigone as child, this romantic theme in fact ﬁts seamlessly with it. We hear that Antigone’s and Haemon’s relationship has not been consummated, and so the idealized love that Antigone feels for him is as much a utopian fantasy as her perfect childhood.

It is not a problem for most of the creative artists of our time (among whom one could include very few novelists) because most of these artists have broken, whether they know it or not, with the Matthew Arnold notion of culture, finding it historically and humanly obsolescent. The Matthew Arnold notion of culture defines art as the criticism of life - this being understood as the propounding of moral, social, and political ideas. The new sensibility understands art as the extension of life - this being understood as the representation of (new) modes of vivacity. There is no necessary denial of the role of moral evaluation here. Only the scale has changed; it has become less gross, and what it sacrifices in discursive explicitness it gains in accuracy and subliminal power.

Hill’s advocated reconciliation, like Cutter’s, is a disambiguation. Any monolithic conception of pain that we might have should be replaced with “a bevy of new ones.” As a start, we ought to disambiguate peripheral pain (bodily disturbances of the relevant sort) and central state pain (the perceptual representation of the bodily disturbances of the relevant sort). The reader will note that these opening chapters, along with many later chapters, are riddled with empirical claims. It is valuable for the philosopher interested in pain to see for themselves which models, methods, and assumptions are at play in contemporary empirical investigations into the nature of pain. It is thus appropriate that considerable space is given to the dominant empirical models of pain.",
