Laugh of the Medusa because the unconscious, that other limitless country, is the place where the repressed manage to survive: women, or as Hoffmann would say, fairies. She must write her self, because this is the invention of a new insurgent writing which, when the moment of her liberation has come, will allow her to carry out the indispensable ruptures and transforma- tions in her history, first at two levels that cannot be separated. a) Individually. By writing her self, woman will return to the body which has been more than confiscated from her, which has been turned into the uncanny stranger on display-the ailing or dead figure, which so often turns out to be the nasty companion, the cause and location of inhibitions. Censor the body and you censor breath and speech at the same time. Write your self. Your body must be heard. Only then will the im- mense resources of the unconscious spring forth. Our naphtha will

the day that she has seen, as she says in The Passion according to G. H. Her whole process consists in working like a madwoman so that a certain path can be frayed toward the point of blinding; while Blanchot completely capitalizes on his mad- ness, Clarice does not feel like keeping the treasure of madness to herself. In both writers the same place is in question, but Clarice wants to communicate her expe- rience. Blanchot, as we can read in Writing of Disaster, believes this experience of revelation to be incommunicable. Nothing moves him, except a desire to keep his treasure. In order for his treasure not to disappear entirely — because whether he writes to God, to himself, or to a madman, he nevertheless writes — he hid it in the brief scene of Writing of Disaster, in the primal scene of the child who saw but will not tell. Blanchot writes: I will not tell you. He draws something the…

her original self. Returning to Emma’s sense of the mural gazing back at her, might the sublime be an experience of looking beyond the image as image and seeing the image as being? Might this be why the image seems so startling when it speaks back to us? If this is the case, when we experience the sublime, we do not merely look upon an image; we may be encountering the image in its abso- lute otherness. We may be experiencing the full realization of the image’s intention when brought into existence. And yet, there might still be more that can learned from Medusa’s story. Con- sider Medusa’s original form, that which she was before Athena changed her. It is claimed that Medusa was not only the most beautiful of the three Gorgons but that she was one of the most beautiful woman ever made, which was why she had so many mortal and divine suitors. Medusa was, quite simply, so exquisite that s…

makes clear in ‘The Laugh of the Medusa’ (1975), it is about the mother within you (whether you are a man or woman) as ‘the rhythm that laughs you’.48 It’s about a kind of ‘feminine text’ (in the original French, androgynously ‘un texte féminin’) or writing (‘écriture féminine’) that aims ‘to smash everything, to shat- ter the framework of institutions, to blow up the law, to break up the “truth” with laughter’.49 In the decades since that essay was published, Cixous’s rhetoric may have altered, but the laughter remains. I hope to throw special light on this ­laughter­ – ­from the mild to the wild and the upside down and back-to-front. I want to give particular emphasis to what is humorous and affirmative, ironic and playful about her writing. This is not to detract from the fact that she is also a major thinker of loss and traumatic experience: her work is, indeed, all about what I call ‘Cixous cuts’. It constantly seeks to bear witness to the sense that

In "The Laugh of the Medusa" Cixous writes that "it is impossible to define a feminine practice of writing, and this is an impossibility that will remain, for this practice can never be theorized, enclosed, coded" (253). Despite this declaration of openness, Cixous assigns a number of rather exclusive qualities to women's writing: it is fluid, vibrant, dynamic. It overflows in floods and streams and waves. It enjoys a "privileged rela- tionship with the voice" (251), and not merely the voice, but the "equiv- oice" (252). Unlike the phallocentric system it overturns, feminine ecri-

(245). The relationship between women's writing and the masculine or- der of both history and literature is thus more than confrontational; it is openly combative. The language Cixous uses to describe the "struggle" of women's writing is suffused with violence: "We must kill the false woman who is preventing the live one from breathing. Inscribe the breath of the whole woman" (250). The whole woman emerges only with the violent death of her false counterpart, and women's writing with the top- pling of the male literary order. Woman must make "her shattering entry into history, which has always been based on her suppression. To write and thus forge for herself the antilogos weapon" (250; emphasis in the original). "The Laugh of the Medusa" is presumably a prototype of this weapon, and its effect is meant to be sweeping, cataclysmic. Indeed the only affinity Cixous acknowledges between woman and the old order is

philosophy of the body, of writing and of resistance. Her woman writer is a fleshly subject, desiring and desirable, writing in words that recover and reveal her sex. Laughter then functions as a subversive site where these lines of thought intersect, and makes room for the words to come. Woman as Metaphor and the Art of Flying ‘The laugh of the Medusa’ begins with a clear statement of its aims: ‘I shall speak about women’s writing: about what it will do. Woman must write her self: must write about women and bring women to writing, from which they have been driven away as violently as from their bodies […]’ (Cixous 1976: 875). This woman whom Cixous is referring to again and again when she says things like ‘woman must write’, is not a stable, singular, biologically determined entity. She herself recognises that this is not one typical woman, a general woman. She clarifies, ‘you…

Marder offers an incisive account in particular of the recep- tion (or non-reception) of Cixous’s ‘The Laugh of the Medusa’ in the Anglophone world, thanks to what she calls ‘the well-meaning, but nonetheless highly problem- atic, English translation of this one remarkable work’ (207). 64 Cixous, The Day I Wasn’t There, 87; Le jour où je n’étais pas là, 163–4.

Cixous goes some way to resolving the suppression and misunderstanding of Dionysus in the lives of men, where he is so often misrepresented as a philandering drunkard, a wayward and destructive Don Juan. As the god of music, dance and theatre, certainly of tragedy (thereby ambiguously sharing with Apollo the patronage of poetry), the god of the mask, and the god of fluid change and re-invention of the ever more fragmentary self, we have a source of discovery, a source of revelation and shocking wonderment at the transience of all life and all art, but also in his ‘effeminacy’, his sexual ambiguity and shape-shifting fluidity, a rebuttal of those stolid patriarchal virtues of constancy and conservatism. His is an enlivening breath, and a call to poetry, to the erotic, and a call back to water. 24 Cixous, ‘The Laugh of the Medusa…

2 Lisa Gasbarrone A distinctly Bakhtinian note is sounded in passages such as this. Yet, as I listened closer, I heard more dissonance than the productive dialogic ex- change I had anticipated. What I hope to outline here, chiefly through my reading of "The Laugh of the Medusa," is the nature of the conflict I per- ceive. The discernible similarities —the echoes, if you will —between Ba- khtin's theories and Cixous's writings remain striking. As Cixous de- scribes feminine écriture, "women's writing" or the feminine practice of writing seems to embody many of the characteristics of what Bakhtin called dialogic discourse. As the earlier quotation suggests, the resem- blance is especially apparent in those moments in which Cixous and other theorist/practitioners of women's writing describe the new relation- ship between self and other that they seek to establish through literary expressio…

unhuman, so devilish, that it filled those hardy manhunters with a sense of dread unspeakable! They did not move their weapons nor think of them; the menace of that horrible sound was not of the kind to be met with arms. As it had grown out of silence, so now it died away; from a culminating shout which had seemed almost in their ears, it drew itself away into the distance, until its failing notes, joyless and mechanical to the last, sank to silence at a measureless remove. In this the laugh of the maniac, or of the woman ghoul, the Medusa: or is it, we may suspect, more the laugh of the author, both in and out of the tale? The equivalence Bierce here establishes between writing and the uncanny returns us to Poe, and a recognition of the importance given to writing and reading in the creation of his uncanny effects. In 'Ligeia' the mock-Glanvill quotation is used to provide…

is consequently demonized or disavowed. She represents the subject-less female gaze, her desire/power silenced into an image (the Aegis on Athena's/Perseus's shield). Medusa's serpentine hair also makes her the "phallic" or bisexual mother whose otherness threatens male sexuality. A Medusan gaze is therefore per- verse, subversive, mocking.

of black and white may be traced, he implies, to the chasms or the figures ‘so mysteriously written in their windings.’ But whether the inscriptions portend racial massacre or refer more broadly to the yearning for escape from the shadow of death (the arm of the human form is ‘outstretched toward the south,’ toward ‘brilliancy and whiteness’), this commentary on writing within the abyss - or writing as abyss - calls attention to engravings which bear witness to the dilemma of mortality. In some primal scene, perhaps coeval with the formation of the chasms themselves, an unknown writer conscious of the ephemerality of speech and his own perishability as a speaking subject carved upon the wall those ‘alphabetical characters’ by which he might continue to speak after is own decease. Whatever their topical content, the ancient inscriptions on Tsalal thus refer to the genesis of …

question that Cixous herself addresses throughout ‘Sorties’ as she negotiates the doubleness of myth—its complicity with colonialism and its capacity to provide a space beyond it: Yes, Algeria is unliveable. Not to mention France. Germany! Europe the accomplice! . . . There has to be somewhere else, I tell myself.21 This book is written under the sign of the Medusa. Its title combines a reference to Cixous’ seminal essay ‘Laugh of the Medusa’ with a ﬁgure from ancient myth who has become an archetype through her multiple receptions. As Marjorie Garber and Nancy Vickers put it in their recent anthology The Medusa Reader: Poets have called her a Muse. Feminists have adopted her as a sign of powerful womanhood. Anthropologists read her image as embedded in the paradoxical logic of amulets, talismans, and relics. Psychoanalysts have understood the serpents wreathing her head as a symbol of the fear of castration. Political theorists have cast her as a ﬁgure for revolt. Artists

have understood the serpents wreathing her head as a symbol of the fear of castration. Political theorists have cast her as a ﬁgure for revolt. Artists have painted her in moods from sublime to horriﬁc. The most canonical writers (Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Goethe, Shelley) have invoked her story and sung both her praise and her blame. The most adventurous of postmodern designers and performers see her as a model, a logo, and ﬁgure for the present age.22 Part of the power of Cixous’ essay derives from the inscrutable ﬁgure of its title. The tutelage of the Gorgon as a beautiful and laughing presence makes a challenge to the traditional subordin- ation of body to mind seem both possible and plausible and, what is more, it requires us to look again at the hollow triumph of Perseus. Cixous’ use of the Medusa exempliﬁes the way that mythical ﬁgures tend to transcend the restrictions of their particular textual incar- nations. It is also shows how the potency of particular receptions

the smell of herbs can be picked up, while still at sea, miles from the coast. The chain of associations is never-ending, just as in Cixous’ work the act of writing is elicited in a way that instigates a continuing unfolding and enfolding that is both liberating and self-examinatory. Again, in Cixous, I learn that the act of writing is a ‘clambering downward’ that can be likened to a plunge, deep into the sea: ‘And when you descend into the sea, then you can imagine whatever you wish: head first and you are in a fetal position – perhaps birth is toward the bottom or the other way up, or straight ahead standing 19 See Roberto Calasso, The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony, London, 1994. 20 Hélène Cixous, ‘The Laugh of the Medusa’, in The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism, New York, 2001, 2052.

testify to her petrifying power; (2) On the fictional level, it is the epigram that erects ‘the statue of Medusa’, creating a monument, however, which lacks a referent in the outside world and emerges as purely fictional con- struct; (3) On the textual level, the epigram resembles a kind of monument itself. It preserves the statue of Medusa as engraved and captured by verse and, at the same time, mobilises it, setting its energies free to be taken up again by future readers or authors. In this respect, it picks up an aspect of the myth that Drummond excludes: it releases the creative powers that, in the myth, are embodied by Pegasus. With its demand for uprooting in order to communicate its message to others, the epigram complements the poem’s seductive powers. Drummond’s readers are urged to seduce the text insofar as the micro myth of Medusa points to a realm outside the poem, requiring its transgression. It is in the tension created between the knowledge of the

masturbation marks both the frustration of uninspired, purely mechanical acts of sexual release and, at the same time, the latent promise of the potentially transformative, orgasmic production of ever new forms. Indeed, in the ecstatic, breathless pages that follow, Cixous seems to make good on the transformative pro- mise: ‘‘The Laugh of the Medusa’’ virtually explodes into an orgasm of deliciously erotic abandon, the female text-as-body emerging into a volcanic eruption of ‘‘jouissance.’’ In this how-to manual of orgasmic writing, Cixous takes care to distinguish between feminine and masculine economies of masturbation. In what she calls the ‘‘classic’’ masculine economy of phallic sameness, ‘‘ . . . the act of writing is equivalent to mascu- line masturbation (and so the woman who writes cuts herself out a paper penis)’’ (253). This masculine economy of masturbation is not a simple ma…

"The Locus for the Other" 3 ous calls for the creation of a new literary movement, a revolution in writing, "The Laugh of the Medusa" is rousing, irreverent, joyous, dis- turbing, and willfully inconsistent. Cixous issues a call to women, to bring them to writing; she seeks to demonstrate by her text both what women's writing is and "what it will do." This call to letters has been celebrated for its effort to break from official (and, by definition, mascu- line) control of writing, to break with what Cixous calls "an arid millen- nial ground" (245). The thousand-year literary tradition against which Cixous is writing, a tradition ironically rich in manifestos such as hers, must be abandoned, she claims, if women are to speak finally in their own voice: "Anticipation," she writes, "is imperative" (245). In place of the repressive past, women will, through their writing, "foresee the un- forseeable" (245), uncover the feminin futur, for which "The Laugh of

that it is a useless undertaking to renounce the wish of her soul, then she turns with a childishly pious prayer to the great goddess, who understands her sorrow, and from her poetical mouth springs forth the immortal song to the 'craft-weaving' Aphrodite. It was allowed her to tell her sufferings, and so the ode is an expression of a heart, pious, but thrilling with hot passion. She calls on the goddess to help her in the present need of her soul; may she as once before float down from heaven and alleviate her sorrow. With genuine poetic fancy she recalls the image of the goddess, how she formerly appeared to her in person, asked with charming sympathy what was the cause of her sorrow and promised her the fulfilment of her heart's de- sires. To this recollection is added the prayer and the hope that this time also the immortal will be favourable to her and render her support: Immortal Cypris of the marbled throne, Daughter of Zeus, for all wiles are thine own,

[SC, 2], he again forges an image of Cixous’s Medusa who, writing “ .. .in white ink”, 27 laughs in a similarly Medusan style to Dogwoman. In the work of Monique Wittig, we find a similar preoccupation with the nature of origins and their relationship to self-definition. Here, though, as the title of her second novel Les Guérillères (1969) makes clear, such originary identities are always seen as collective in nature and can again be specifically related to Russo’s grotesque female body-politic. The journeys undertaken in this text function as metaphors for the develop- ment of the women’s movement, in the literal, mobile sense of the word, but in psychoanalytic terms, we might see in this recurrent pat- terning Lacan’s infantile and extra-uterine Imaginary Realm, defined by and bounded by the outer limits of t…

imposed by men through the concept of castration. Medusa is that mythic being whose petrified, snakelike hair terrifies men who, in defensive response, accede to erection and enter into the symbolic. Freud's short essay on the Medusa myth7 has inspired mu ch mas- culine writing. The meaning of castration is destroyed through laughter. Woman is not that terrifying being that men would like to make of her in order to dominate her better. To the contrary, she undoes the law of meaning through laughter and gives herself to be seen in her beauty and splendour. The comments anticipate the critique of the look and the being looked-at-ness of woman in La jeune née (The Newly Born Woman), but also forecast the read- ing of Clarice Lispector's Agua viva (The Stream of Life) that treats of creations of the sea, the 'méduse', or jellyfish that is both in and out of the water - or both in …

H therefore busies herself with ‘burning old books, manuals, professional papers, theoretical volumes’ (p. 6), clearing away the clutter of the past from the space of writing. I performs a similar operation with her body, reporting that she has ‘ordered new hands, to caress you and to write you, hands that will ¢t you’ (p. 42). These moves can be seen as sugges- tive of the fact that the stripping away of the self advocated at the end of Angst is beginning to be put into practice in Promethea. As well as making room for the other, this opens up the text to the reader (who can be thought of as another incarnation of the other). Promethea succeeds in drawing the reader into the narrative to a much greater degree than Cixous’s earlier texts had done. Humour plays an important part in th…

being at his wit’s end; he must instead direct his energies into the creation of an artwork that can both absorb and create a symbiotic writing. The ﬁnal passages from this episode see the omniscient voice of ‘Justius’ addressing the ﬁgure of the universal writer, and, once again, drawing parallels between the writer and the God-Man, or Christ. The writer is ‘excruciated’ to the ‘cross’ of his ‘cruelﬁction!’ (FW 192: 18– 19). The ﬁgure of the universal writer, Shem the Penman, also invokes the spirit of a transformed Shakespearean intertext. Justius retorts: ‘[d]o you hear what I’m seeing hammet?’ (FW 193: 10–11). He wants to know whether the penman will for the laugh of ‘Scheekspair’ help ‘mine with the epithet?’ (FW 191: 2). The name of Shem gradually morphs into the bard’s greatest dramatic character: Shem the Penman becomes ‘Pain the Shamman’ (FW 192: 23) and Shamman becomes ‘hammet’…

suggested by its strong interest in the enchanting powers of the femme fatale and mesmeric forces of poetry and storytelling. Shelley’s ‘On the Medusa of Leonardo da Vinci’ and Rossetti’s picture-poems ‘Aspecta Medusa’ and ‘Lady Lilith’ refer to the visual power of fascination and captivate readers through a continuous shift between verbal and visual media as they express a prom- ise of fascination that is never redeemed. Pretending to protect readers from harmful images and the perilous lure of the femme fatale, these poems, just like Keats’ ‘La Belle Dame Sans Merci’, turn out to exert the very same fas- cination they seem to be warding off. As I will show, the luring quality of these poetic narratives, which is at the core of Coleridge’s mesmeric poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, derives from their investment in various kinds of medusamorphoses, both those that make explicit use of the Medusa

Yet though Hypsipyle must have known the bad news was coming, she cannot help herself from doggedly questioning the messenger, so great is her need to delay full acceptance of the rumor’s signifi cance. She com- pletes her letter by wishing upon Medea the same woes that she now suff ers from, and worse, predicting the part of the myth told in Euripides’ Medea (lines 155–64).

the author especially for this collection (in its French original version). It describes Cixous’s relationship to the materiality of painting itself rather than to philosophical questions about art or aesthetics. The writer plays with the signifi er pain included in painting in order to stress the violence and the ‘combat’ contained in the act of painting or creating a work of art. She writes, ‘I know it by hearsay, one is at pains to create artistically, especially in painting. We have numerous evidence of the pain felt by painters. Of their ways of being at pains, of painting painstakingly’. The following chapter, ‘Spero’s Dissidances’, is devoted to the American artist Nancy Spero, whose work was itself inspired by Cixous’s The Laugh of the Medusa. Cixous sees in Spero’s art a pow- erful claim for the misfi ts and the victims, those who also fi ght social structures: ‘Woman…

and that reading is writing. Claudine Fisher continues exploration of Cixous’ fiction, focusing on Limonade tout était si infini (1982). For Fisher, Cixous’ fiction proves the theoretical premises announced in The Laugh of the Medusa, particularly her declaration that the writer’s responsibility is not merely to create works of art but to offer up “works of being.” Animate rather than static “works of being” do not arrest life in verbal taxonomies but offer us—through evocative portraiture—the gift of life itself. In the first of three essays in section II to deal with Cixous’ relation to other writers, Judith Still explores the theoretical relationship of a feminine gift economy to sexual difference in Cixous’ work and Derrida’s Given Time: I (1992).

Through figures of, for instance, heading off and away, adver- tisement, dreaming in literature, the art of veering, cuts, the portmanteau, side thinking, all wards, and a few other neologisms besides, this book attempts a new kind of drawing of the dreamer, realist, analyst, writing: Hélène Cixous.

sense of relief is one of the factors of that nervous motion of contraction and expansion called laughter. Life is simplified by the grotesque which is nothing other than a deformation per excessum or per defectum of the established forms. The grotesque, at least in this sense, relieves life of its inescapable grimness and releases it into laughter. Caricature is based on the display and masterful combination of the most minimal facets of the human soul, its weak spots, which gush forth from the irony of social life, which is itself, after all, somewhat ironical and insane. With irony, in the convulsive motion of laughter, caricature provokes in man this feeling of extreme lightness, because irony throws over its raised shoulders Zarathustra’s “dancing and laughing” cape of many colors. The ancients were able to perceive in irony the roots of Tragedy. They crowned their tragic sp…

I know why you haven't written. (And why I didn't write before the age of twenty-seven.) Because writing is at once too high, too great for you, it's reserved for the great-that is, for "great men"; and it's "silly." Besides, you've written a little, but in secret.

with her white dress and outspread arm dominating the visual plane. The second, after the poem’s conclusion, places the lifeless body of Oriana in front of the grieving knight as he kisses and partially embraces her. Except for the arrow that pierces her sides and a glimpse of her dark hair, Oriana’s prostrate corpse looks like it might be in fact her funerary monument resting on her tomb, with her hands improbably clasped upwards together in prayer. The loss of the woman is voiced throughout the poem by her lover’s plaintive and repetitive sorrow. The illustrations translate that sound into the image of Oriana, the agent of the illustrated poem even though she never speaks or acts except to watch the battle and then die by an arrow meant for the knight. Hunt’s designs ironically make visual and prominent Oriana’s inaccessibility, as well as her looming presence even in death, as much as the plaintive voice of her lover repeatedly calls her name and yet is restlessly

τι ἔρῃ τῶν λεγομένων βουλόμενος μαθεῖν, ἕν τι σημαίνει μόνον ταὐτόν ἀεί. Writing, Phaedrus, has this strange power, quite like painting in fact; for the creatures in paintings stand there like living beings, yet if you ask them anything they maintain a solemn silence. It is the same with written words. You might imagine they speak as if they were actually thinking something but if you want to find out about what they are saying and question them, they keep on giving the one same message eternally. (275d-e) Like painting, the written word fixes living things in time and space, giving them the appearance of animation although they are abstracted from life and incapable of change. Logos in its spoken form is a living, changing, unique process of thought. It happens once and is irrecoverable. The logos written down by a writer who knows his craft will approximate this living organism in the …

such as alliteration or assonance within the line, are kept to a minimum, and the poetry follows Wordsworth's precept in being, except for the metre, very like non-rhetorical prose in its diction. The epos and prose forms of this phase, such as the epistle and the formal satire, are naturally very close together. In satire observation is still primary, but as the observed phe­ nomena move from the sinister to the grotesque, they grow more illusory and unsubstantial. We note among epos forms a comic counterpart of the danse macabre: the "testament" poem, of which the best known English example is Swift's poem on his death. Closely related to the testament convention are Donne's Anni­ versaries where the death of a girl expands into a general satire or "anatomy"—this term will also meet us later. We are now in the area corresponding to comedy, and still within the vision of experience. The convention that marks a slight

Discarded, the last screen has just fallen. Stupefaction! Tattooed, the Emperor of the Moon exhibits a col­ orfully patterned skin, more a medley of colors than skin. His whole body looks like a fingerprint. Like a painting on a curtain, the tattooing-striated, iridescent, embroidered, damasked, shim­ mering-is an obstacle to looking, as much as the clothing or the coats that fall to the ground. Let the last veil fall and the secret be revealed; it is as compli­ cated as all the barriers that protected it. Even the Harlequin'S skin belies the unity presumed in what he says, because it, too, is a har­ lequin's coat. The audience tries to laugh again, but it can't anymore: perhaps the man should strip…

narrative, giving it more of a lightly comic feel in Agathon’s misinterpretations, but he does keep extremely close at times to Ovid’s source text, referring to Daphne’s ghostly white pallor and her shivering. He incorporates the representation in Psyche’s dance of the entire process of Daphne’s metamorphosis into a tree in Ovid, describing how her feet change into sluggish roots and her powerless attempts to resist the transformation with her arms. This latter comment by Agathon is again a misunderstanding that Wieland attributes to his character, since Ovid’s Daphne specifically requests the transformation from Peneus. She does not wish to resist at all, though Agathon might be suggesting second

any of its shapes, is a phaenomenon with which M. Comte seems to have been totally unacquainted. There is nothing in his writings from which it could be inferred that he knew of the existence of such things as wit and humour . . . . [And] there are passages in his writ­ ings which, it really seems to us, could have been written by no man who had ever laughed. (153-154) Mill's example at this point is indeed hilarious. As a replacement for the Catholic gesture in which one makes the sign of the cross over oneself, Comte proposes a gesture in which one touches the ''Principaux orga­ nes" of the body, expressing one's devotion to the biological principles through which one is sustained in life. "This may be a very appropriate mode of expressing one's devotion to the Grand Etre," Mill concludes. "[B]ut any one who had appreciated its effect on the profane reader, would have thoug…

to a few essays or articles: The Laugh of the Medusa’, ‘Sorties’, your participation in The Newly Born Woman. To carry out this amputation is unjust to your work which is plural; overflowing; which incessantly questions what it draws. The risk, with writing that is attentive to subtleties, is that laziness, deafness, or surprise should lead people to hear only one voice, to stop at a single aspect. That the reading should reduce and reify because this is easier. One must wonder how this happens. What happens—or does not happen—when one does so little justice to a body of work. Admittedly, there is misunderstanding about the term ‘theory’: the writing you practise is more like a form of philosophical reflection that you lead through poetry. But the What happens: events interiors, snatch them from the cradle, from the source. I want to watch watching arrive. I want to watch arrivances. I want to find the root of needing to eat.

Now even in tragedy, which by its very nature is majestic and admits of some bombast, misplaced tumidity is unpar- donable; still less, I think, would it be appropriate to factual narration. This is why people laugh at Gorgias of Leontini 2 when he writes of 'Xerxes the Zeus of the Persians', or of 'vultures, animated sepulchres'. Similarly certain expressions of Callisthenes3 are ridiculed as being high-flown and not sublime; still more are some of Cleitarchus's4 - a frivolous fellow who, in the words of Sophocles,6 blows 'on wretched pipes without control of breath'. Such effects will be found also in Amphicrates and f legesias and Matris, 6 for often when 1. I h a v e a d o p t e d t h e t r a n s l a t i o n p r o v i d e d b y A . S .

she is enveloped in foam. In other words, similar to her own Miss May, Gippius appears in this photograph in the guise of the eternal feminine or Aphrodite Uranus.7 But if Gippius styled herself as Aphrodite in this famous early pho- tograph, she was nonetheless intensely skeptical about the idea that the eternal feminine could be adequately embodied in a woman of ﬂ esh and blood. She had already gone on record about the difﬁ culty of suc- cessfully embodying or incarnating the eternal feminine in some of her early short stories, and she soon became very critical of certain aspects of the Blokian idea of the Beautiful Lady. Even though she was an early supporter of Blok and his poetry, helping him to make his literary de- but on the pages of The New Path (Novyi put’) in March of 1903, she ap- peared to take on the very idea of the Beautiful Lady quite directly in her early parody…

the pen and its black ink (“l'encre de la mélancholie,”) is striking. The blackness and stickiness (above all the blackness, but also the stickiness, which hints at constipation) project an image that is infused with that of depressive melancholia and that, given its application to writing, seems to characterize the act of literary composition itself. There is also the imagery of swelling and splitting. This picks up the analogies made for the author's anger and even, as I have described it, his agitation and flight of ideas. The combination of depression and anger echoes the central polarity of the poem, between lethargy and anger. Persius's illness exhibits an affective ambivalence that matches that of the Eumenides Painter's Orestes. He seems to combine the latent agitation of Orestes (this “splitting” and anger) with the apparent despondency (evident above all in the metaphor of black ink and earlier in the yawning). (The anger [furor or mania] matches that, it

into an apple and tosses the fruit toward his beloved. She picks it up and reads the words aloud. Unwittingly she swears to join herself in marriage to nobody other than Acontius, a man she has not even met but who has just managed, rather duplicitously, to bind her to him by means of his written words. This story, told first by Callimachus (Aetia fragments 67-75) and then by Ovid himself through letters in the double Heroides (20-21), reveals not only the deceitful nature of letters but further the tantalizing fantasy offered by an epistolary composition that the writer can achieve total control. When Cydippe, despite her best efforts to bring about a different result, finally must break down and marry Acontius because of the binding oath written out for her byAcon- tius that she read aloud and thus swore, the reader witnesses Acontius' power "through writing to fulfill his own desire./64 Before we move on from our considerations of the conventions

And yet, Caitlin does not merely pause in her note-taking to contemplate a striking painting—an act to which some may relate. Rather, Caitlin is overwhelmed by the image. It draws her attention with such force that it pushes out all other thought. In an instant, her concern changes from transcribing the professor’s lengthy descriptions to the visceral image that looms before her. Indeed, Caitlin’s orientation changes so drastically that she is no longer even able to attend to the professor’s voice. The image and what it makes her feel is all. The painting ﬂoods Caitlin’s senses and is felt throughout her body. It ﬁlls her nose and throat with the coppery smell of blood. She feels its wet sticky gore upon her ﬁngers. Her eyes rove and plumb its rich, dark depths. Her scalp crawls, skin tightens, and brow wrinkles. She breathes in deeply and swallows as she tries to take

As goddess of night, the moon, and the unconscious, she is the White Goddess, as Robert Graves has so aptly named her. ʺThe test of a poetʹs vision, one might say, is the accuracy of his portrayal of the White Goddess... The reason why the hairs stand on end, the eyes water, the throat is constricted, the skin crawls and a shiver runs down the spine when one writes or reads a true poem is that a true poem is necessarily an invocation of the White Goddess, or Muse, the Mother of All Living, the ancient power of fright and lust — the female spider or the queen‐bee whose embrace is death.ʺ 5 Thus it is intimacy with the female that the male fears, for her embrace may be fatal. In our last chapter, we shall examine in psychological depth differences between the sexes; what has kept them from achieving harmony in the past; and how this harmony, or sacred marriage, may be accompl…

Preface Anyone rash enough to write a book with a title like this had better brace themselves for a postbag crammed with letters in erratic handwriting enclosing complex symbolic diagrams. The meaning of life is a subject ﬁ t for either the crazed or the comic, and I hope I have fallen more into the latter camp than the former. I have tried to treat a high-minded topic as lightly and lucidly as possible, while at the same time taking it seriously. But there is something absurdly overreaching about the whole subject, in contrast to the more miniature scale of academic scholarship. Years ago, when I was a student in Cambridge, my eye was caught by the title of a doctoral thesis which read ‘Some aspects of the vaginal system of the ﬂ ea’. It was not, one would guess, the most suitable work for those with poor eyesight; but it revealed an appealing modesty that I have apparently…

ody was Hegemon of Thasos, who, one gathers, would make epic poetry ridiculous by altering the words, twisting them into the coarse and common, while keeping to the stately meter, the noble style of epic. Giving low content an elevated form is just what Manet does in Olympia by portraying a recognizable prostitute, a demimondaine, in a composition deliberately evoking the Venus of Urbino. Neither Titian’s painting nor his own is thereby made ridiculous, however. We may smile at the Venus turned into a courtesan, but Olympia, even if no longer shocking the way it was in its day, still has an unsettling effect and demands a serious response. Manet did parodies but not mock- eries. Whether the low in the form of the high or vice versa, incongruity between form and content has been an enduring method of parody. It is a breach of decorum, the rhetorical principle that calls for the

This is a religious body, the fl esh of putrefaction, the bodily in its suff ering and melancholy. But what of the body of delight and natality?

of those rapes. . . . That was the only revenge ... on the big bellied sex. (69) Rex's hypermasculinity masks a terrified womb envy. What finally defeats him is the sign of the taboo raised on high as a totem, a stone icon of Venus, sign of the "bleeding woman, her gaping hole eating seed and spitting children. It was life, that hole, that woman, it was endless fecun- dity." It is the power Helene Cixous has described as the laugh of the Medusa. When neither the police nor the crucifix (the sign of the bleeding man) daunts him, the woman "terrifie[sl him" into submission (87), and he is forced back into the hole from which he last emerged. "Rawhead Rex" begins as what seems to be a celebration of male sexual violence. But hard-ons don't last. At least half of the story is described through Rex's perspective, to the extent that much of the pleasure of reading it is designed wi…

beautiful images in Pierre Klossowski's "Diana's Bath." Here he shows us Acteon, first, to be sure, attacked by the goddess' hunting- pack (for, surprising her while bathing, he caused her loss of shame, without which the gods are unable to recognize one another). Acteon turns in sudden revolt against Diana and flogs her at length with the silver crescent (lunar symbol) he has torn from her, filling the country- side with his insults and his imprecations: "Shameless bitch! he cries at her." But Diana does not deceive; she is the simple illusion of stone. And all this violence is lost among the echoing woods under the vault of evening where the new moon is already rising. The goddess has assumed the prerogative of all divinites. She has regained the heavens, inviolate despite our modern rockets, from which she turns to us but one simple face, so that we are never able to tell if we are seeing her real face or only her mask - in other words, whether we are beholding

Mr K. was a tender father. 4 And Dora breaks down the circuit with the utterance of her 'no'. Or with her laughter: 'And at the right time, [Dora] would have covered them with laughter.'5 The exchange value can be annulled through a breakdown of meaning which is precipitated by laugh- ter. The breakdown of meaning through laughter, a first step toward liberation, is at the basis of one of the most openly polem- ical feminist texts, 'The Laugh of the Medusa', on the subject of women. Biting, acerbic, funny and persuasive, Cixous's own laughter soars in the article translated in Signs: 'The Medusa laughs and she is beau tifu!' , 6 is a caB to women to shatter the negative image imposed by men through the concept of castration…

slight playon typeface that announces the head of a paragraph that guides the reader by asking a question and puts a little variety in a text that otherwise, in one breath, sweeps over two hundred pages. This inspiration, or rather, respiration for her is a long-winded sign of life. The white spaces are reduced to a minimum. Death is pushed out in favour of life. The questions are the same. Cixous asks herself about how to write, with whom and in what posi- tion(s). The questions are worked through on quotidian, literary and quasi-mythicallevels. No death. Hope? That is saying too much. Is it hope? A gush of blood that surges and cornes to shake up your heart; as if waves agitated the calm of the sea. An awful desire to tear yourselfaway, to be raised up, to run, but no legs, to traverse the earth in one breath, you are the drive, to throw yourself on the breast of the sea, …

In a gesture of contrition and self- sacrifice, Serge offers a felt- tip pen to his aggrieved friend. Grabbing hold of the pen and sketching a skier with a little woolly hat on the Antrios, Marc defaces it— or, seen from another angle, he makes the painting his own. Abstract art is transformed into a representational image; whiteness now signifies the blinding sheets of a snow blizzard. The ink is washable, it turns out, and the Antrios has been returned to a pristine state by the play’s conclusion. But it is Marc who intones the p…

Here as often in Greek literature and in Sophocles, a person wronged imagines his or her enemies laughing. 1125 Don't make that sound. There is a very interesting scholium (an ancient or medieval note preserved in our manuscript tradition) on this line: "It is necessary for the actor to look up to heaven as he makes this cry and to hold out his hands. The chorus restrains him by saying 'Do not say anything excessive.' " 1203 Beloved Orestes.

Scroll). . .is a rare specimen of an existential work which deals frankly with scenes of the weird and fantastically ugly. The scroll contains in rich proportions a spirit of laughter that can be termed black humor. Giant maggots with glaring eyes and long beards are shown in a pool of feces, teasing the deceased who have been cast there. Snapping at the heads of the dead, who are drowning in the pool of excreta, are large beelike insects, which seem to have fl own out of monster comic books. It is as if we can hear the dead crying in agony, “Ouch! Ouch!” The faces of the deceased are exaggerated in comic-book fashion and a sense of the humor of the situation is clearly revealed. The artist took delight in rendering this wretched scene, while viewers of the scroll must also have been simultaneously delighted and terrifi ed.

7. It is noteworthy that the facial expression of the one woman whose face we are able to see does not convey the frenzy the term maenad invokes-a term used frequently in descriptions of this piece. In his influential The Life and Art of Albrecht Diirer, Erwin Pan- ofsky (1955, 32), for instance, describes the scene as follows: "[T]hey burst upon their victim with the fury of genuine maenads" I have chosen not to describe the women as maenads, resisting the intrusion of ancient tellings of the myth on our reading of this piece. Yet facial expressions are notoriously hard to read, particularly in the case of artists such as Mantegna or Diirer, who preferred to portray women with little vis- ible affect or with downcast eyes, as here. Research into Renaissance representations of maenads will have to bring further clarification on this point. 8. Of fifty-eight cases of insults that were prosecuted in Venice by the Avogaria di

suggest alternatives to both Sedgwick’s understanding of the character and earlier, heteronormative readings that similarly rendered her a help- less, gender-traditional victim of Marcher’s selfishness. However, none of these scholars questions the idea that Bartram is silent. The mid-­twentieth-­ century French context in which Duras interprets the story provides another option. For Duras, James provides abundant textual evidence that Bartram communicates in gender-specific ways that Marcher cannot understand. The anti-climax of the final scene becomes James’s authorial declaration that this was never actually John Marcher’s story. In her influential 1975 essay, “The Laugh of the Medusa,” Hélène Cixous cites Duras as one of three French authors, with Colette and Jean Genet, who epitomize “écriture féminine” (878–879, n.2). By the time La Bête dans la jungle is staged, Duras has…

as a contretemps. Onuphrius is applying the finishing touch to his mas- terpiece: the portrait of his girlfriend Jacintha. But suddenly his brushes turns “stiff,” the hand shifts, the paint lands on the nose rather than the pupil of the eye. Trying to erase the mistake, the painter changes the expression of the nose and spoils the painted smile with a pair of rather virile mustaches. A deviance of the hand makes representation impossible and turns the dream of realistic rendering into a joke, a “phallophany,” that is, the apparition of a phallus totally outside the scope of symbolic mediation. At first, “the blood had started to flow under the flesh,” under the surface (27). The painter could give an exact equivalent to life in art. But suddenly, the clumsy gesture reverses the process: the touch of white applied on the black pupil of the inanimate painted figure “like a drop …

and discovered that his fingers touched only the painted surface. He con- ceded that Parrhasios had won the contest, for while Zeuxis had fooled birds, Parrhasios had deceived another man. More intriguing illusions for considering gender are recounted in the several tales of artists and patrons becoming enamored of the images of women they created. When paintings depicted human beings, one of the pitfalls of wonderful mimesis was that the image was so lovely and lifelike that it actually inspired desire—a long- ing to possess the painted image that was as strong as if the subject were alive. The story of Pygmalion is the most famous of these: the sculptor Pyg- malion carved a statue of a woman so beautiful that he fell hopelessly in love; in pity, the gods granted her life. In the absence of divine intervention, artists have to settle for the original model, but even in these cases the role of woman is regarded as both object of desire and work of art. Here is an

and dancing intoxication, conveys an intimate complicity, even an identification, with femininity. 12 The Bacchic 'grapevine' and the mystical 'rose,' Dionysus and Venus, Bacchus and Ariadne ... one can imagine a series of mystical couples implicitly evoked in this funeral and resurrectional grouping. Let us recall Nerval's naming of the Virgin Mary as 'white Rose' and, among others, 'Les Cydalises': 'Where are our lovers? / They are in the grave / They are far happier / In a more beautiful region! ... Oh white betrothed! / Oh blossoming young virgin!'13 The 'flower' can be interpreted as being the flower into which the melancholy Narcissus was changed - finally solaced by his drowning in the reflection-spring.

Blanchot has become an absolutely mythical figure of the modern writer. And it seems to me that this erection of the figure of the writer complies not with what he’s been reproached for—his ruminations over death, his indulgence in death, etc. (there’s no indulgence in that whatsoever)—but with something like the idea that the writer is he who writes while knowing he is already dead. It is the enunciative position of the writer that presupposes his anterior death—and that, to my mind, is the great modern literary myth.1

378 THE THEBAN NECROPOLIS PRESERVATION INITIATIVE THE SARCOPHAGUS OF SETI I 379 from its undulating form. The form was milled into a pol- yurethane block while the surface was distorted into a ﬂ at plane for elevated printing. The printed surface of the sarcophagus was built up in 5-micron color layers of UV cured resin by Océ - A Canon Company. Once printed in relief and colour, the surface was mapped back onto the curvilinear structure and glued into its ﬁ nal position. This process of re-materialisation was experimental from the outset and modiﬁ cations were improvised as new difﬁ culties were discovered. The facsimile of the sar- cophagus of Seti I is an object with its own visual qualities, and in the same way that plaster casts were valued as ob- jects with unique qualities and scientiﬁ c value, so the sarcophagus has become more than an imitation. It is an object of wonder and excitement that reveals the evidence of the
