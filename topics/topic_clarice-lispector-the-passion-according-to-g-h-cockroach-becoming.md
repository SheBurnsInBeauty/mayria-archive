This is how the cockroach’s appearance and the contemplation it triggers in G.H. shows us how a commonplace natural being, even if it’s repulsive, can convey a redemptive or transformative mes‑ sage. For many, G.H.’s eating the cockroach might be an unthinkable act. All this is possible, but not absurd. Here, the absurd is the way in which an insignificant insect can lead this woman to rediscover her own human condition. One of Lispector’s contributions to the aesthetics of the absurd in Latin America is derived from this relationship between the characters of the insect and those of the human condition. This tradition can be found, for example, in Julio Cortázar, in one of his fantasy stories, “Axolotl,” from the book End of the Games (Final de juegos), where he experiments with this kind of narrative introspection that leads to the metamorphosis of a human being into another spe…

male/female relations as constructed by a particular society. At other times, Lis- pector places these interpersonal struggles in the broader context of the individ- ual subject's contact with impersonal cosmic forces, termed "reality" or "God" (although not in any conventional religious sense); this contact does not seem to be entirely voluntary, it is often fraught with violence, and it may be cast as an interaction between self and other. In one of Lispector's best-known novels, The Passion according to G.H. (1964), this "reality" inheres in a cockroach: a fe- male narrator watches it closely, kills it, and then, in a sort of mystical commun- ion, tastes its substance. In this tense encounter, observation yields repulsion, identification, and dizzying reversals of relative power as the woman feels en- gulfed by the cockroach, which is in turn victimizer and victim. I think it fair to …

of a particular use of language. We are, the epilogue leads us to suspect, lost in a repressive and exploitative sociopolitical construct where even our concept of God—our yearning to go "to God"—reveals itself to be a function of language. To change this situation, the text implies, we must rethink who we are and what, as individuals and as a society, we wish to be. Although it is highly unlikely that she would have ever put it in quite these terms, Lispector's work clearly reveals a lifelong struggle to un- dermine what we can now see as phallogocentrically established gender roles (Barbosa, Clarice Lispector: Spinning the Webs of Passion, 11, 94-95), this quality undoubtedly being her greatest single response to those who demand a socially committed "dimension" to her literature. Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that Lispector's texts manifest what can be described as th…

rical pieces. It swings incessantly from one interlocutor to the other. It is a mar- ionettelike text, hence well balanced. Kleist makes a very direct critique of narcis- sism. By contrast, Clarice performs an ongoing one. Her bear — more refined and more elaborated than Kleist's in this story —is the cockroach in The Passion ac- cording to G. H., where a relation to the other as animal takes the form of a passion. In Kleist, a quasi theorem makes the text look older and more rigid. The schema has the shape of a key and turns like one. In the ' 'Marionette Theater," in the part of the story organized around a center, there is a dialogue on the mystery of dance. Then there is a second moment in the text with the story concerning the young man with a thorn in his foot. The articula- tion of the two stories occurs around the sentence: "I said that, regardless of how cleverly he might present his paradoxes, he would never make me believe that a mechanical puppet could be more graceful

his protagonist, he "had to give up sex and soccer" (22). Further, some of the narrator's comments are clear parodic references to earlier novels by Lispector and to their female narrators. Works like Agua viva and A paixfo segundo G.H. appear, for example, to be the object of the following self- parody: A acqio desta hist6ria teri como resultado minha transfigura?Ao em outrem e minha materializagqo enfim em objeto. Sim, e talvez alcance a flauta doce em que eu me enovelarei em macio cip6 (26). The action of this story will result in my transfiguration into an other and in my ultimate materialization into an object. Yes, and perhaps I'll even achieve the sweet flute music and become entwined in a soft creeper vine (20). Rodrigo S.M.'s expectations seem to model themselves here on the mystical quests undertaken by the narrators of Lispector's novels…

of the collection. The poem's narrator expresses admiration for the poem's male addressee in terms that recall the old erotic topos of amor de lonh, claiming he has fallen in love with him from a distance.' This unnamed addressee, the gentle spirit, is exhorted to act out the narrator's own violent erotic fantasy of pulling the old lady of Rome by the hair. Taking violent possession of the beloved is eccentric to the usually passive attitude of the weeping Petrarchan lover. The re- vival of Rome requires the will to dominate, whereas the love of Laura demands humility, fear, pallor, servitude. Yet the similarity between these two loves, which I would like to explore here, is in an underlying morbid eroticism, the uncanny allure of scattered remains and lifeless body parts. This macabre aspect of the lover's carnal obsession with Laura, idealized in the gemlike verses of the rime sparse, is made explicit in the Latin prose of the

This exchange between self and other at the heart of Lispector's fiction is not peaceful, but instead is charged with double-edged violent forces. The passionate aspect of Lispector's writing, which many critics have noted and which Lispector herself stresses —in the title of A paixdo segundo G.H. (1964; The Passion ac- cording to G.H.), for example —involves not only the quest for positive connec- tions, as in the passion of love, or the intense introspection of her characters, who seek contact with truths that reason cannot fathom or represent. It also includes the sacrificial impulse that sparks her fictional imagination: a via crucis, with its Christian resonances of suffering in place of and for the sake of another, a process that does not always follow ethical and moral precepts, and that may be required of the characters as well as suffered by their author. In a closing autobiogra…

tesque. The narrator surprises the boy, who tries to imitate the work of art and bursts out laughing. The sublime boy becomes an imbecile forever. Clarice's text is also about grace and loss of grace. The youngest daughter wants to sit on a stool. She has a spontaneous desire. The father finds it funny. Her desire is sanc- tioned by the father, who legitimates this spontaneous grace and, by legitimating it, renders it less spontaneous. He approves, recovers. The little girl begins again, this time in order to please the father. In other words, she prostitutes her- self. She sells her desire to the father. She no longer does it because she wants to give pleasure to herself, she no longer eats her apple, but she does her little curt- sies to please the father. There is no commentary on the part of Clarice Lispector other than: " . . .it was no longer quite so amusing." This is the fall. It touches on what elsewhere

From feminine to human: cultural pluraHsm 85 the encounter of otherness, be it toward an impoverished person, Macabea in The Hour of the Star or the cockroach in The Passion accordz"ng to G. H. Yet, she has an amazingly broad range that allows her to write also and with great humour about human foibles and vulgar passions. She can sustain the writing of a passion long and painful as that of G. H., but she is also capable of writing chronicles for a newspaper as weIl as very funny stories full of human weaknesses and sexuality, as in Soulstorm. Cixous reads, and also appropriates, Lispector for her own ends by a strategy of canonisation. 3 She appropriates her writing by imitating it in her own text. By making her into a saint, a process of narcissisation takes place. To caU Lispector a 'delicate Titan', recalls the hero-worship of nineteenth-century idols. It may be that s…

articles, and books, unless otherwise noted, are my own. 1. This account, in an interview with Lispector's family members and friends after her death, is by Tania Kauffman, Lispector's sister. 2. In one interview, Lispector emphasized that both male and female writers imitated her work, and in another maintained that "it just happened" that the sole character of her novel The Passion according to G.H. was female, as if wanting to escape any restriction, either of her influence or of her fictional imagination, along gender lines (Gilio 1976, 44; Lapouge and Pisa 103

was already ill, and due to a very widespread superstition, it was believed that hav- ing a child cured a woman of disease. So I was deliberately created: with love and hope." The text above says that Lispector forgives her parents, but that she cannot be forgiven. The text below is but one inaudible scream. Clarice goes beyond the parental pardon, since she does not talk about it. She takes on the discourse of the parents, the way she heard it as a child, and that is criminal. It was not she who was conceived but her mother. Whence Clarice's writing of despair and solitude: to say, my father and my mother killed me, is prohibited. If she did, she would kill her parents. So she does not say it, and accepts being the most solitary human being from the cradle onward. "I am sure that in the cradle, my first desire was to belong." Clarice has a false memory of this founding scene, which, in …

on her desire to bury her “criminal” brother. She makes clear that even in the deadlock of that fatal position one can desire, and by this she shows that desire can transgress the reach of the law. “Even condemned to death by the law within which I had to realize the desire I am, I still can desire. And by the same gesture, I reveal that the law, which made my desire possible, is radically ﬁnite.” That law too is in fact but desire, that is, an instance which, it’s true, wants to reign the universe, but nevertheless only can want, desire that. Creon takes the law for an inﬁnite power that can realize the good it promises and he takes himself for the one and only subject of that law. But what is he forced to see when the play ends in its tragic catastrophe? That he is not exactly that subject of the law he thought he was. That the real “support” of the law is desire, and that in …

among other natural debris in an almost recursive recycling, but Cliff’s hunting mother burns herself in an act of retaliation: ‘Mother who goes forth emitting flames from her eyes. Nose. Mouth. Ears. Vulva. Anus. She bites the evildoers that they become full of sores. She burns the canefields’ (Cliff 1987, 163–4). The gothic fire imagery, haunting and torment of humans by a spirit is noticeably sexual and gendered; yet, it furthermore alludes to a symbiosis with the land as an act of decolonial resistance. Harriet and Clare experience a sort of catharsis in the biosocial space they seek to reappropriate that helps them deal with the oppressive conditions their ancestors have been a part of and from which they now face liberation as queer individuals. Clare and Harriet both strive for liberation from a restrictive colonial environ- ment, a liberation found only in ruinate with each other. What is also remarkable

associate sympathetic suffering with sexual desire or religious pleasure. As this scene opens, Eulalia has sought out her minister for spiritual comfort: she fears that she cannot marry her beloved Moreland, because of her father’s opposition to her union with a southerner. By way of consolation, the minister tells her a story from his own early life. When his ﬁancée, Emma, died shortly before their marriage by falling over a cliff while horseback riding, he plunged into despairing anguish, until: One of those blessed servants of God, who are appointed for a peculiar mis- sion, found me, and dragged me up out of the depths of the abyss of blackness in which my soul was plunged; he poured oil and balm into my wounds, bound them in the swaddling bands which wrapped the babe of the manger, and left me not till he had laid me a weeping penitent at the foot of the cross. Then a divine warmth …

their sexual desires. Collier's concern here is less with the language itself than it is with connection between words and action. He uses Euripides' Phaedra as an example of a woman possessed by an "infamous Passion" who nonetheless concealed her desire, remaining "regular and reserv'd in her Language" and thus managed to retain her modesty (9-10). For him, Phaedra's chaste language represents a deeper sexual virtue. She feels an "infamous Passion," but because she does not express it, it re- mains cloaked and ultimately destroyed. In contrast, openly sexual lan- guage not only expresses improper appetites but in itself engenders these appetites. Here Collier turns quickly from language to action, arguing that playwrights deliberately depict women as mad or silly in order to "enlarge their Liberty" (10), to allow them to behave in an openly sexual manner. Speech thus provides the opportunity for action. Collier's second objection develops directly out of his apprehension

had sought to force himself upon her. Further, after some prodding, he admits that the woman had to a certain extent encouraged him. So much for the now discredited claim for purity of intention, innocence of response on the part of such people (the hint that this widow knew pre- cisely what she was doing injects the phrasings of a different, more Rabelaisian discourse into this intricate sub-narrative). So much, too, for the difference-within-community Werther had previously stressed: now he too suffers a bitter, fruitless love. Deep in the throes of unenviable passion he sympathizes with the peasant; more precisely empathizes, for now there is a fun- damental identification, thus an undoing of the difference he had claimed in the earlier stages of his connection with the youth. Relations within their community of two have shifted, and so has the discourse in which he describes those relations to his correspondent: his addressee

to address the beautiful lady and console her in her grief. Her response is a parody of the vulnerable lady, articulating as it does all the grounds of her vulnerability. The lady was, says Philarchos (as one might imagine) ‘inﬁnitely amased to see her self thus surprised, att such a time of night, and in such a place, her chamber, all alone in bed, and wholy att my mercy, as she caled itt’ (U, II: 125). The archness of tone here is emphasized, given that this account of adulation for Poliarchos is one re-told by Poliarchos himself to two women, Veralinda and Pamphilia. His extensive account includes speciﬁc details that make it hard to take the scene seriously, as we hear how he ‘satt upon the bed (a little more then sitting), bending towards her and discorsing of many matters, yett all of love, wee passed till day breake the time away’ (U, II: 126), and ripples with erotic desire, as he throws himself on to the bed and holds her trembling hand as she tells how

be regarded as pornography; it merits the more exalted title of "pornology" because its erotic language cannot be reduced to the elementary functions of ordering and describing. With Sade we witness an astonishing development of the demonstrative use of language. Demonstration as a higher func­ tion of language makes its appearance between sequences of description, while the libertines are resting, or in the interval between two commands. One of the libertines will read out a severe pamphlet, or expound inexhaustible theories, or draft a constitution. Alternatively he may agree to hold a conversation or a discussion with his victim. Such moments are frequent, par­ ticularly in justine, where each of the heroine's torturers uses her as a listener and confidante. The libertine may put on an act of trying to convince and persuade; he may even proselytize and gain new recruits (as in Philosophy in the Bedroom). But the intention

and prevents mastery or appropriation of the text by the reader. The primary car- rier of Cixous's readings is an ongoing interest in poetry attached to the proper name of Clarice Lispector, whose texts are read alongside those of Joyce, Kafka, Kleist, Blanchot, and Tsvetayeva. Many of these proper names have crisscrossed Cixous's texts since the beginning of her career as a writer. Lispector has been a concern for a number of years, but the shift toward Eastern Europe is recent and now (in 1990) indicates how artists' interests announce political events that fol- low. If the texts chosen by Cixous reflect in various ways a preoccupation with writing as well as an insistence on pleasure, they are also linked to current issues in literary theory. Cixous's analyses offer at times welcome divergences from more established canonical lines. She takes up now-consecrated literary figures, mainly from the past. Rarely do her analyses extend to contemporary culture in a

ist, who is persuaded his pleasures will be keen only insofar as they arc entire, will therefore impose, when he has it in his power to do so, the strongest possible dose of pain upon the employed object, fully certain that what by way of voluptuous pleasure he extracts will be his only by dint of the very lively impression he has produced. When Justine protests that this leads to "the cultivation of cruel tastes, horrible tastes," Clement agrees, assuring her that "we can give our­ selves up to our passions, whatever their sort and of whatever their violence, wholly sure that all the discomfitures their shock may occa­ sion are naught but the desirings of Nature, of whom we are the in­ voluntary instruments."20 Justine is quick to carry this train of thought to its logical con­ clusion. She argues, "if through atrocious principles of cruelty you love to take your pleasure only…

viii D INTRODUCTION poetry that comes from the rapport of the body to the social world, ecriture fem- inine disrupts social practices in the ways it both discerns and literally rewrites them. For Cixous, in Agua viva Lispector insists on the effacement of the subject, which results in opening on a limitless perspective and undoing the frame of common or representable human experience. Lispector practices what Cixous has been looking for. It is the kind of affinity she feels, the kind of shock she receives at a first reading of Agua viva, that prompts her to take a long detour through much of Lispector's work, some of which is more thematically oriented and marked in its style by existentialism. Lispector's contact with the world is immediate: her language portrays the struggle that human beings engage in with their social milieus and with themselves. Yet the writing does not work through philosophical or dialectical terms that make up the heritage of Simone de Beau-

Lispector. Often her chicken stories are addressed to children. These children are adults, that is to say, the readers, who never really know whether they are the egg or the chicken. There is no chicken in Agua viva, but a tiny egg that refers to an immense egg. Our task will be to look for eggs and work on the relationship be- tween eggs and chickens. This goes back to what comes first, the chicken or the egg, the question of origin. In Clarice, the question is latent, in a comical or serious mode. She inscribes the question of life and its origins. I say inscription in order to speak more concretely of something that belongs to a literary text. It is something that would be grafted, scratched, or ingraved on something like a black board, a monument, or on something of the order of a textual surface. Clarice's texts, like Kafka's, are not narratives. They contain a secret, a les- son. B…

present the dark side of family ties, where bonds of affection hurt and constrict; yet the institution of the family sustains the characters, who might rebel, but usu- ally do not escape its grip. All the stories in Lispector’s collection turn on an epiphany, a moment of cru- cial revelation (Sant’Anna 1973, 198) when, in the midst of trivial events, or in response to a chance encounter, her characters suddenly become conscious of re- pressed desires or unsuspected dimensions of their psyches. Whereas the men come to terms with the implications of a socially defined masculinity, the women experience the reverse of their accepted roles as mother, daughter, wile, as gen- tle, pardoning, giving females. In their moments of changed awareness, they may realize not only their imprisonment, but also their function as jailers of women and men. The epiphanies, mysterious and transgressive, bring …

cated society. As a means of recommending manners and morals to their readers, both of these courtesy books relate the adventures of two elegant young men, Euphues and Philautus, whose coming of age Lyly depicts as an ongoing encounter with temptation in the form oflove and desire. In the indiscriminate, capricious fickleness of most of the female characters and the continually wrongheaded, hopelessly infatuated state of Philautus, Lyly depicts sexual desire as a compulsive, impersonal, and ridiculous passion, which can be understood only as a direct contrast to reason and wisdom. "What new skirmishes dost thou now feele betweene reason and appetite, loue and wisdom, daunger and desire" Philautus asks, rhetorically echoing conventional Petrarchan sentiments and antitheses. All in all we are expected to perceive that "the desease of loue . . . is impatient, the desire extream…

'It is sweet, indeed,' replied Clotilda, 'but its sweetness must wither ere night closes around. It is beautiful, but its beauty is short-lived, as the love evinced by man.

termed them, ‘two active homosexuals’ and ‘mortal sinners’ (p. 77). Instead of revealing her discovery of their sexual secret to her flatmates, she broods on it in silence like a witness to an unspeakable crime. She projects on them the role of monstrous Other, envisaging them in imagery appropriated from Gothic fantasy. The portrait of them she sketches one evening strikes her as resembling ‘a two-headed monster in a fairy-tale, the kind of the thing the hero had to fight … or a gargoyle, with two tongues for waterspouts’ (pp. 125–6). However, on deciphering the second secret that haunts her – her growing feelings of attraction for Ruth – she is forced to recognize that her own sexuality is not as orthodox as she had assumed. The discovery enables her to redeem the two women from the domain of the abject and acknowledge their full humanity. The transformation from monstrous to human tha…

to being sympathetic to the performed (as opposed to the actually suffered) passions of others. A woman’s love makes her susceptible to her lover’s mere performance of love’s symptoms and his repetition of amorous tropes because she reads his actions through her own feel- ings. Belinda notes “a certain Languishment” in Courtal’s eyes; she “often heard him sigh, observed him to look pale and tremble when on any Occasion he touched my Hand, Symptoms which I now began to know were infallible Tokens of a Tenderness far beyond that which springs from bare Esteem.”24 Thoroughly familiar with the theater and the performances of the passions, Haywood instills an irony in Belinda’s observation. Courtal’s signs of tenderness are “infallible” only because they convince Belinda that they are real. Though Haywood’s novels often include references to how rakes take advantage of innocent wom…

in the newspaper. Nadia Battella Gotlib dates what she terms Lispector’s “circu- lation of texts” from the mid-1960s: the beginning of a period of movement of Lispector’s texts among various of her publications in newspapers, magazines, and books: these texts circulate, appear and reappear, at times without any alteration, effecting a veritable ring-around-the-rosy of texts. . . . Indeed, not only do the fragments circulate, but also the characters. And Clarice herself, as Clarice, identifying herself explicitly as writer-narrator-chronicler. (Gotlib 1988, 189) These textual reappearances contribute to the blurring of autobiography and fiction in The Stream of Life. Texts that were first seen in The Foreign Legion and in the newspaper, and that were then assimilated into the unpublished “Scream- ing Object” in order to define the autobiographical persona, “Clarice herself,” reappear in T…

brought about his gradual awareness not only of how much he enjoyed the sadistic nature of his treatment of Miss F. and her tolerance of it. He also recognized that even if she was trying to manipulate him, his feeling so much in control of their relationship gave him a sense of excitement. A new theme then emerged in the treatment: namely, Mr. L/s fantasy that if he really wanted to marry again and have children of his own, it would be the beginning of old age and death; only a playboy existence of carefree sex and lack of responsibility guaranteed eternal youth. Now his adolescent way of presenting himself in the session (an excessively and almost inappropriately juvenile style of dress and manners) became the subject of analytic exploration; it emerged as a protective effort to avoid the sense of doom connected with the idea of adulthood. As revealed in a series of loosely connected dreams, the fantasy gradually crystallized in

economy that does not have limits like a tree trunk. And, furthermore, it is also — and that is where Clarice Lispector would go a step further—the danger of re- pressing the tree at the same time as the forest. Kleist makes an incisive critique of seduction. He continues to insist on the necessity of transparence, of the greatest lightness possible in language, so that what he calls the "idea" may appear. Kleist would like to be able to compose a poem by extracting from his own heart the very "idea" that inhabits him in order to deposit it with his hands into the heart of the other. Kleist's mad desire is similar to that of Clarice, who insists on making the hand appear in her text. Clarice wants things to circulate from hand to hand, from heart to hand, from blood to blood, and go to the other side of the poetic bark (ecorce) without which, paradoxically, she cannot do but beyond which…

hom osexuality had always occupied her conscious life, while the attitude aris­ ing from the O edipus com plex had rem ained unconscious and had appeared only in such signs as her tender fondling o f the little boy.

A long tim e before the birth o f her brother and still longer before the first reprim and at the hands o f her father, she had taken a specially keen interest in various young m others. From very early years, therefore, her libido had flow'ed in tw o streams, the one on the surface being one that w e may unhesitatingly designate hom osexual. This latter was probably a direct and unchanged continuation o f an infantile mother- fixation. Possibly the analysis described here actually revealed nothing m ore than the process by w hich, on an appropriate occasion, the deeper heterosexual libido stream was also

gaged in the task of revision that makes impossible a notion of the sub- ject as simple and consistent. Nothing could more obscure the image of the ideal woman and wife than this sketch of a literary woman, who through self-representation has gained the power to reflect upon herself, to take note of change, to imagine that she might not be restricted by 'law' from attempting to construct a multifaceted personality that might actually use the resources of fiction to gain social and political advan- tages. Such complexity was of course precisely what earlier commen- tators wanted to discourage" (Jordan 176-77). 44. Accelerating action or feeling is an important feature of Labe's artistic temperament. Just as intellectual passion stimulates the accel- eration of satisfaction in this text, erotic passion can stimulate the ac- celeration of amorous activity or fantasy in Labe's love lyric. One is reminded most strikingly of the quickening multiplication of kisses in

would suddenly lose their relish, did they not raise us above others, and com- mand submission and deference: and it may be thought, that our attachment to things grand and lofty, proceeds from their connection with our favourite passion. But the preference that is given to things grand and sublime, must have a deeper root in human nature. Many bestow their time upon low and trifling amusements, without having the least tincture of this favourite pas- sion: yet these very persons talk the same language with the rest of mankind; and at least in their judgment, if not in their taste, prefer the more elevated pleasures: they acknowledge a more refined taste, and are ashamed of their own as low and grovelling. This sentiment, constant and universal, must be the work of nature; and it plainly indicates an original attachment in human nature, to every object that elevates the mind: some men ma…

cockroach is not pure fancy, but a ﬂeeting insight into the essence of the workday, a defamiliarization that nevertheless reveals the “underside” of what makes such a day possible. Natanson believes not only that the intuition of essences takes place in sudden starts, in the immediacy of the moment, but that in presenting the world consciousness enacts the very intentionality it seeks to know. The reader of literature seizes upon such moments as they emerge in the course of a reading, and this means that the time of reading is invari- ably interrupted by the time of life. That constant interruption emerges in Natanson’s work as the very presentative rhythm of consciousness as it ﬁnds itself in the landscape of its ﬁctive universe. Bringing forth the past and charting the associations that reading unleashes, Natanson en- acts the temporal horizon of the reader’s consciousness, one who not only reads the world in literature but rediscovers the ﬁctive as the es-

Stewart is observing this from his own window: he watches her searching the apartment, and being surprised by the unexpected return of the man who lives there. This short sequence changes everything: Stewart behaves as if he were seeing Grace Kelly for the first time; she captures his full attention, and, completely fasci- nated, he can no longer take his eyes off her. Without a word being exchanged between them, we—as spectators—can see it all: now he very much desires her. She has quite literally entered the “window of his fantasy,” and started to function as the object of his desire. … Let us now look on the other, feminine (right) side of the formulas of sexua- tion.

This patriarch from outer space, wearing a crown of interlaced snakes and a purple cape, orders her rudely about, but nevertheless helps her overcome her submis- sion to the male rule on earth. Miss Algrave’s repressions are magically lifted, she finds pleasure and profit in prostitution, and even plans, with vengeful glee, to become her boss’s mistress. I would suggest that Lispector shows a similar glee in embracing the stereotypical simplicities and sensational bluntness of this very different narrative style, mocking for the moment her own more subtle and labored literary achievements. The parodic aspect of The Stations of the Body, then, cuts two ways: against sensational fiction, whose strategies…

In a moment of a great sadness and despair, Witold has a sudden need to see Ignacy; he sneaks to his house at night just to adore the sleeping teenager for a while. Interestingly, Gonzalo rather refrains from any direct seductive action toward Ignacy and instead asks his teenage servant Horatio to play sport with him (watching Ignacy and Horatio playing stick­ ball also intensifies Witold’s feelings). In other words, the erotic fascinations in Trans-Atlantyk have to be mediated by someone else (cf. the Girardian concept of mimetic desire).20 However, the reader will not know whether Gonzalo’s attempts prove successful, as the novella ends in a typically Gom­ browiczian absurd and non-conclusive way, w…

Água Viva, other than the very strikingly brilliant Passion according to G.H. (I do not know if there is any relevance to what you have said about the “heart,” but one shouldn’t forget that Lispector’s first novel is titled Near to the Wild Heart, which in a way cites James Joyce.) In any case, there is no doubt that Água Viva is a literary example that resonates well with what we have talked about so far. We have just touched on the “inter-­diction,” and one finds the nar- rator in Água Viva saying, on the one hand, “I do not know prohi- bition,” and on the other, “I am also taboo for myself, untouchable because forbidden,” all this while seeking to grasp the words that remain unsaid or unsayable.17 We have also raised the question of touch and its relation to penetration, and this question is equally at stake in Lispector’s text: the narrator attempts to touch the air when she writes — in fact, she claims indeed to “penetrate” the air

the desire of another. Observe here the power of Chloe’s imaginary identifications – that is, she sees in Daphnis the perfection she wishes in herself, both visually and tactilely; note how she touches herself to see if her skin is as soft as that of Daphnis (1.13.2). As noted, Longus’ text is a elaborate symbolic structure which relies heavily on the force of mental images, phantasia, conjured by words. To the extent that Lon- gus’ narrator is an indicator of the text’s implied reader, the reader of Daphnis and Chloe is expected to make such Imaginary identifications, which will add power to the significances of the Symbolic order, all items furnished for both education and pleasure. Further, as noted, since objet a is the true motivator of desire, and all substitutions for it merely temporary and (very) approximate, there is al- ways a restless, repetitive search for further substitute…

brutal attack on visual, olfactory, and auditory modes of perception, a vile synesthesia of the repellent and obscene. Moreover, we are slowly made aware that the corpse is in a state of perpetual motion; maggots are pouring like a viscous liquid across the ragged remains of the body, falling and rising like a series of waves. The poet is struck by the sheer beauty of this rhythmic movement as it mimics the music of running water and the sound of the wind. Even as he conjures up the horror of death jerked back to life, of ﬂesh uncannily animated by the worms that are consuming it, he wrenches us into an awareness of the remarkable symmetries that thrive in the midst of putrefaction. Yet this aestheticizing gaze does not annul the horror of what is being evoked but accentuates it; the rotting carcass is both like, yet utterly unlike, the blossoming ﬂower to which it is compared. As in…

delinquents. But she still gave the impression of someone restless and insufficiently absorbed. Emotions which had previously supplied the energy for her work now stalked and idled. Marcus noticed in her a new sentimentality which, ill-matched with her old persona of a brisk sensible pedagogue, produced an effect of awkwardness, of something almost pathetic or touching. She displayed a more patent affection for former pupils, a more patent affection, he nervously noticed, for himself. And just lately she had made the alarming and embarrassing suggestion that he should move into the vacant flat at the top of her house. Marcus had returned an evasive reply. “I’m afraid Muriel is rather typical of the modern young,” Norah was going on. “At least she’s typical of the brighter ones. She’s naturally a strong-willed high-principled person. She ought to make a decent citizen. But somehow it’s …

in which the narrator incorporates and appropriates Ligeia for himself ± or perhaps has already done so, because the time frame of the story is notoriously unstable. There comes a moment, Bronfen says, when `he now fully possesses the knowledge she had', and she goes on to amplify this by saying that `Ligeia is the complete possession of her lover'. This is the first textual crux, the first aporia in Bronfen to which I want to call attention, and I shall return to it below when I look at the tale in more detail, but perhaps it will indicate the next direc- tions of my argument (and feasibly save some unnecessary expend- iture of labour on reading) if I say now that this appears to be an undecidable sentence. From this phrasing we are meant to infer that Ligeia becomes completely subjected to her lover; but as soon as we begin to think of unambiguous equivalents which will employ any modu…

must respond to the calling, try to go beyond the limit, and do what she says and only look. But in this quasi indistinction between subject and world, if one goes there alone—as she says in The Passion—one has the feeling of getting lost, or going mad. It is true that one needs to be accompanied by the other, who will be a witness, even if the / disappears. The other is the witness of my disappearance. At that moment, the supreme scene of the passage to the infinite is not felt like total anguish, like the fear of disappearing and of not coming back. It can be imagined that in the act of love one accedes to what Clarice calls life on the other side and, at the same time, this access to the infinite finds its limit in the presence of the other. "You" limits the infinite through which I was going. On the one hand, Clarice suffers from an originary solitude. On the other, nobody ever seems to have wanted to accompany her where she wanted to go. She has always

Her apology – Forgive the zeal That, too presumptuous, whisper’d better things And read the book of destiny amiss (ll. 192–4) – is heartfelt, and facilitates the ﬁ nal move of the poem which, having precipitately cele- brated political freedom, is forced to retreat instead to the abstract and the intellectual: There yet remains a freedom, nobler far Than kings or senates can destroy or give; Beyond the proud oppressor’s cruel grasp Seated secure; uninjur’d; undestroy’d; Worthy of Gods: The freedom of the mind.

and may take some time. Discussing the bereaved’s state of mind, he remarks: In the meantime the existence of the lost object is psychically prolonged. Each single one of the memories and expectations in which the libido is bound to the object is brought up and hypercathected, and the detachment of the libido is accomplished in respect of it.48 Freud’s observations shed light on the difficulty that Pen encounters in relinquishing her attachment to Cara. They help to explain the conflict she experiences between her recognition, on a rational plane, of the fact of Cara’s death and the intense need she feels to keep her image alive through acts of memory and imagination. A strategy Donoghue employs to represent this conflict is to juxtapose representations of the two physical states which, according to Bakhtin, most clearly exemplify the grotesque body: the body in a state of sexu…

very identity of his hosts. For Lucy, this is the destruction of her identity as a monogamous ﬁancée and a virtuous woman by transforming her into a woman who walks the night and harms children. For Gilroy, it is the destruc- tion of his identity as a respectable lecturer and loving ﬁancé by forcing him to commit crimes, sabotage his own lectures, assault colleagues, and proffer affections to another woman. Gilroy is able to retain his identity (and life) owing only to the sudden death of the parasite. Robert Holt begins with noth- ing. Having lost his job and his home, he has little left for the parasite to take away. Weary on his feet, almost fainting with hunger, and seeing an open window in an apparently abandoned building, he makes the decision to act. To save his own life, he enters the building. This ability to act is what the par- asite takes away from Holt: “I did not obey the frantic longing which I had

The stings from those talons made me wetter. “She sucked at my breath now, and her hands were everywhere on my back, her prick a rod. Then I felt the wings. I felt their size, and they brushed me like a breeze from the middle of May, only softer. Each wing stroke a counterpoint to the joint rubbing against me, urging me to open to her. “It’s my hands that remember. Her scent is on them and will never leave. I smell it when I touch the clay or rest my hands on the stone. Every wing touch brushes me, my legs, my behind, and all through my hair and the down on my cheek.

of their love for each other, it is not presented positively: 'She seemed to be striving to obliterate not only herself, but the whole hostile world through some strange and agonised merging with Mary' (Hall, 82: 376). Sexual passion becomes almost a weapon against each other and a scourge to themselves. Sex becomes the site of the world's pressures upon them. It is social rejection that turns them to the company of their lesbian friends, Mary seemed frantically eager to proclaim her allegiances to Pat's miserable army. Deprived of the social intercourse which to her would have been both natural and welcome, she now strove to stand up to a hostile world by proving that she could get on without it. (Hall, 82: 384) This is very slanted. By referring to it as 'Pat's army', we are focused onto the least positive of all the women - Pat who: 'Collected her moths and her beetles, and when fate …

solidarity, he is raped by all nine of the troupe known as the Acrobats of Desire; but it is also this event which enables him to escape the cataclysm which overwhelms the fairground and all the people in it. The Count, meanwhile, ends up in a cannibal cooking-pot, and dies in triumphant pain, victim of his own drive towards non-being; while, ever the inveterate observer, Desiderio watches and narrates in horri- fied fascination from the sidelines. In seeking inclusion, therefore, Desiderio only experiences repeated exclusions, and the ultimate object of his quest is no exception. His allegiance to the Minister's absolutely rational vision has never been entirely wholehearted, not least 'because I was aware of what would have been my own position in that watertight schema' (p. 60). He thus enters the domain of Dr Hoffman with the ultimate object of his desire, Hoffman's daughter Albertina, covertly hoping to find 'a palace

in the relationship with God.’ They escape the world of differences by retreating into the world of oneness, and their capacity for forgiveness depends on this kind of mystical unifying fantasy, in which splits and contradictions are overcome. As the Rebbe says of his supplicants, ‘if they weren’t blind they would go to Him who alone can say “I”, to the only “I” in the world’ (An-sky, 1920: 33). Writing from a Lacanian perspective, and with appreciation of Konigsberg’s paper, Wolfe (2010) offers an alternative view. Noting the temptation to read the play as an example of ‘Liebestod’ – the consum- mation of love in death so sought after by Romantic protagonists – he also makes the point touched on above, that the love of Khonon and Leah cannot be read as a spontaneous romantic outburst. Rather, it is a love foretold by the Symbolic order itself; it is a love that in adhering to a paternal…

makes him different from Clarice Lispector, who does not move from the wound. But little by little, this difference is erased. If one takes a distance, one begins to see the world emerge in an analogous fashion. Genet or Lispector cherishes a world that for us, for them, is tenderly and violently other. In A Bela e a Fera (Beauty and the Beast), for example, there was the sudden apparition of the one- legged beggar. In Clarice, the chain of the other, the violently other, contains a terrifying beggar as well as a brigand, and the psychotic child as well as the cock- roach. It is a universe quite removed from the human sphere. This problematic world can also be found in Genet with differences, for example, in the choice of those who represent otherness. In Genet the others are often the Arabs. I allude to the blind Arab who has his white cane to protect himself from the violence of

exhaustion. He does not go over to the other side of the mirror and he dies of it. "An inconceivable change came over the young man." The narrator had not foreseen the consequences and will have understood the process of the loss of grace only in the last paragraph, which sheds light on the entire story. All of Kleist's marionettes have threads that we can choose to let go or not let go. I would like to put myself in a rapport with these marionettes that would be like a brushing or a slight touching, with as much lightness as possible. The texts read each other. A space that answers all of Kleist would be in relation with all of Clarice Lispector. Our memory has to be vigilant on all sides. The thematics of my reading deal with innocence, or with what I would call a second innocence. There are at least two types of innocence. I could speak of a virgin innocence and of an innocence regained, even if it seems tautological. Is

that leads to the metamorphosis of a human being into another species; in Cortázar’s particular case, a fish. Clarice Lispector achieves this mutation with astonishing accuracy, perhaps as a result of her own experience of having grown up with immigrant parents in a society where she had also retained a certain degree of exoticism as an outsider. Lispector once said that she was not influenced by the French existentialists, nor by the concept of Nausea as introduced by Sartre (Colasanti et al. 2008: 18). She stated: my nausea is truly felt because when I was a child, I couldn’t stand milk, and almost vomited it back up when I was forced to drink it (…) I mean, I know what nausea is, in my entire body, in my entire soul.18 She was not a Sartrean.

Now one begins to take off in a new relation between subject and object, in a nonsubjective world. Here one finds all the themes of The Passion according to G.H. Agua viva is not calculated in mathematical fashion. It is, as Clarice con- stantly reminds us, a text that follows itself, which lets itself be led, which takes risks with the acacias and is not afraid to let itself go. It is not an unconscious populated with Freudian scenes. True, it always takes place "behind some- thing," as Clarice says. It is prelogical, prediscursive. It happens because there is, because "there takes place." This place is largely that which would be de- limited by the range of the body: within reach of hand, ear, or the senses. It al- ways goes through something concrete. There is a propagation that does not al- low for the imaginary or phantasm. A reading that works on themes must work on big, large themes, for example, on everything that takes root, is source of the

is a succession of dark spaces. We sink into the very heart of darkness. The apple, which is at the place of light, is perhaps the heart. The question of sexual difference is constantly being raised by Clarice. There is an astonishing part in this passage where she enumerates three types of con- fusions. It is a word that looks light and familiar. But it is not. It is the very in- tricacy of passions. The scene takes place between Martim and Vitoria. Vitoria is talking. She is in one of these great moments of interminable monologues. She is alone. She arrives at something that could be called the paradoxical extremity of purity and she falls. There are admirable passages punctuated by Martim's inner reflections on how Vitoria bores him. This can be taken at the banal level of com-

by them. Yet, insofar as the comic expansion of Oedipus allows one to see these other oppressor triangles through the lens of the microscope, there appears at the same time the possiblity of an escape, a line of escape. To the inhumaness of the "dia- bolical powers," there is the answer of a becoming-animal: to become a beetle, to become a dog, to become an ape, "head over heels and away," rather than lowering one's head and remaining a bureaucrat, inspector, judge, or judged. All children build or feel these sorts of escapes, these acts of becoming-animal. And the animal as an act of becoming has nothing to do with a substitute for the fa- ther, or with an archetype. Because the father, as a Jew who leaves the country to settle in the city, is undoubtedly caught in a process of real deterritorializa- tion; but he never stops reterritorializing, in his family, in his business, in the

has no grief. The sole passion of his life will have been this feeling of ecstatic happiness, once and for all. That is because in Blanchot, we stay in the space of the classical moral law and of the categorical imperative. But there are always variants. In Kafka, it is not as clear as in Blanchot where it is written in a kind of a scintillating black and white. In Kafka, everything is very ambiguous. The man is insatiable and he still cries. A key for understanding is given too late. There are continuous slippages. It is either as if Kafka could not tolerate such cruelty or as if he told himself the story. Clarice Lispector completely displaces the dilemma. She never did enter the world of the law as it is described here. This does not mean that she is absolutely without law. If we look at the different positions, we can say that where Blanchot discovers that there are no stars in the s…

was, in effect, an entirely new vision of sewers, where the magical was overlaid onto the rational, in order to make the prosaic pleasing. However, in the particular space of the subterranean reservoir, where even if the sewage was not visible it was however present in the imagination, older associations emerged, or perhaps resurfaced - not unconsciously as might be suggested by the psychological model - but with the writers fully alert to the contradictory aspects of this experience and the pull of both fascination and fear. It was the unique character of this space that prompted a conflation of the rational, magical and monstrous - a point emphasised by the writers themselves, who knew this was an experience never to be repeated. Indeed, for the writer for the Daily Telegraph, the new vision paradoxically stimulated these older associations: in short, old and new were insepa…

Introduction N JOHANN WOLFGANG GOETHE’S Prometheus, an early dramatic fragment (1773), Pandora rushes into the arms of her father, Prometheus, and breathlessly reports that she has witnessed what must have been sexual intercourse between her friend Mira and Mira’s lover Arabar in an open meadow. Pandora is overwhelmed by what she has seen — Mira’s initiation into womanhood — and by the nameless, vicarious passion ignited in her- self. “Er küßte sie tausendmal,” she reports. “Und hing an ihrem Munde, / Um seinen Geist ihr einzuhauchen.” Alarmed by Pandora’s outcry, Arabar had fled and left Mira to exhaust her still live desire in Pandora’s embrace, who remains aflame with excitement. “Was ist das alles,” the girl asks her father, “was sie erschüttert / Und mich?” Prometheus answers with one of the oldest of conceits, “Da ist ein Augenblick, der alles erfüllt. / Alles, was wi…

In fact, I cannot respond better than to cite a passage from Cla- rice Lispector. At the beginning of her Água Viva, she speaks of her desire to capture the fugitive instant in which is found, she says, “the is of the thing.”15 That is going to be the preoccupation of the whole book. Now, just after that beginning, she goes on to say: “Only the act of love — the limpid star-­like abstraction of feeling — captures the unknown moment, the instant hard as crystal and vi- brating in the air.”16 I could go on quoting Lispector, but here, I only want to pause on the words “the limpid star-­like abstraction of feeling.” Simulta- neously, one is surprised by the terms here according to which jou- issance (“feeling”) is articulated, because an abstraction is hardly sensible, so it seems; and one feels quite sharply [vivement] how this expression, “limpid star-­like abstraction,” suggests…

Cape province. An indication of his capacity for change is given in the scene in which he repeats, rather mechanically, the view of the ‘Church Fathers’ that, unlike the souls of humans, the souls of animals ‘are tied to their bodies and die with them’. Yet he makes this remark when Lucy has found him asleep in the cage of the abandoned old bulldog bitch, Katy (p. 78). His body inclines him towards an afﬁnity that he is not yet able to articulate. Indeed, his most crass pronouncement comes in the following scene, in reply to Bev Shaw’s sense that he likes animals: ‘I eat them, so I suppose I must like them, some parts of them’, he quips (p. 81). Coetzee is careful to discredit Lurie in this scene in which his shameful appraisal of Bev Shaw’s unattractiveness is given in lingering detail (through Lurie’s focalization, pp. 81–2). This is before the attack on the farm, with the physical ass…

lyric feeling; all this made for an admirable charlatan type, in which there was something of the hairdresser as well as of the bull-fighter. From the first scene he brought down the house. He pressed Lucy in his arms, he left her, he came back, he seemed desperate; he had outbursts of rage, then elegiac gurgling of infinite sweetness. . . . Emma bent forward to see him, scratching the velvet of the box with her nails. Her heart filled with these melodious lamentations. . . . [T]he voice of the prima donna seemed to echo her own conscience, and the whole fictional story seemed to capture something of her own life. But no one on earth had loved her with such love. If Natasha remains at too great a psychic distance from the opera's fictions, Emma leaves too little distance. Flaubert insists upon the physical presence of the theater.

On the level of transference - and to affIrm that she too, like me, could write of love - Anne began to draw comic strips representing the lives of policemen and their sexual adventures. Little by little, onomatopoetics give way to bubbles enclosing words and dialogues of increasing complexity, and to her telling me that 'these cop stories, they're like a dream, a novel.' At the next stage, Anne imagines herself a writer of love songs - but in English. One will note the utilization of drawings, and then the foreign language, to reach a more and more exact representation of unconscious contents. The sending of letters to the analyst is the following stage, expressing more directly the psychic pain and lament. Inside the sessions where she brings her writings, Anne's discourse modifies

being at his wit’s end; he must instead direct his energies into the creation of an artwork that can both absorb and create a symbiotic writing. The ﬁnal passages from this episode see the omniscient voice of ‘Justius’ addressing the ﬁgure of the universal writer, and, once again, drawing parallels between the writer and the God-Man, or Christ. The writer is ‘excruciated’ to the ‘cross’ of his ‘cruelﬁction!’ (FW 192: 18– 19). The ﬁgure of the universal writer, Shem the Penman, also invokes the spirit of a transformed Shakespearean intertext. Justius retorts: ‘[d]o you hear what I’m seeing hammet?’ (FW 193: 10–11). He wants to know whether the penman will for the laugh of ‘Scheekspair’ help ‘mine with the epithet?’ (FW 191: 2). The name of Shem gradually morphs into the bard’s greatest dramatic character: Shem the Penman becomes ‘Pain the Shamman’ (FW 192: 23) and Shamman becomes ‘hammet’…

Once he has done so, he continues the family’s bloodline by marrying and procreating with his granddaughters and nieces. But his survival does not only depend on the literal consumption of the bodies of his family members. We later learn that Howard has used the bodies of his mine workers as the necessary ‘mulch’ required to grow the fungus in the first place and thus ensure his ongoing immortality. Noemí stumbles upon the graves of these workers in the family graveyard. When she questions Howard about the nature of the workers’ deaths, he merely emphasises the fealty of capital over human labour: ‘they needed to die,’ he tells her, ‘you must make the soil fertile’ (2020, 236). In Howard, the novel therefore locates its critique of the rapacious appetite of silver capitalism. To this end, it makes use of the gothically monstrous to express the refor-

And here we have the social victim becoming a real victim; the disinte­ gration of her morale is identified with the disintegration of the natural phenomenon. Nature herself seems to be siding against her, thereby reinforcing the cruelty of her destiny. It is not our purpose to judge whether or not such a melodramatic reinforcing de­ vice is successful (though, it must be admit­ ted, it is a well-realized sequence, achieving a genuine grandeur even in its excess) but to consider an effect of language, a form of expression. As in Variety, the subject becomes ap­ parent through the concrete facts but is not limited to the actual story; a whole series of significations radiate round it, which it does not exhaust, even though- a…

This is when the phantasmagorical character of the commodity turns into a utopia, anticipating a further, critical step in Benjamin’s aesthetic consider- ations: his stance in favor of the technical reproducibility of the work of art, its loss of aura and its bending to serialization. The end of beauty appears here in the downfall of the contemplative, ecstatic character of the aesthetic experi- ence, which is substituted by its shocking nature. The cult value of the artwork related to its hic et nunc, which is connected to the aura, is more and more
