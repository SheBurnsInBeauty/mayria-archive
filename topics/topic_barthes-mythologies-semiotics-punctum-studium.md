inary’ denotation reveals an ever unfolding chain of connotations. Barthes begins to move here from a structuralist to a poststructuralist approach while also demonstrating a certain connection between them. Barthes’ interest in the structuralist project of the scientiﬁc study of sign systems, and his attempts to classify and to explain systematic relations that create signs and myths, evolves into a poststructuralist recognition of a plurality of meanings and of a complex inter-relation between texts. Barthes advances the project further in S/Z, a book in which he analyses Balzac’s short story ‘Sarrasine’, by elaborating a reading method involving breaking the text down into very short sections, or lexia, and interpreting these through ﬁve codes which organise textual meanings. The ﬁve codes are the hermeneutic, proairetic, symbolic, semic and referential. The hermeneutic code refers to the aspects of a narrative or text that contain an enigma and its solution, a question and

Barthes chooses his words very carefully here, characterizing through them not merely the impact of Kristeva’s work but more importantly its major theoretical tenets. The ‘signiﬁed’ Barthes refers to is the stable meaning or concept which any method of analysis requires if it is to present itself as scientiﬁc or objective. Kristeva’s attack on notions of stable signiﬁcation centred on the transformation of Saussure’s idea of semiology, or what was increasingly called semiotics. Semiotics in mid-1960s France argued for its own objectivity by employing Saussurean concepts such as langue (the system) to stabilize the ‘signiﬁeds’ it studied. Myths, oral cultural traditions, literary texts, indeed any cultural text, can be scientiﬁcally analyzed, so structuralist semiotics argued, because at any one moment signiﬁers exist and function within a synchronic system which provides determinable sig…

1 Semiotics Roland Barthes Until the 1950s academic study of culture was largely limited to an exploration of high culture. Literature, art, architecture, music, etc. were deemed worthy of study because, supposedly, they articulated sophisticated and nuanced modes of thinking. Popular culture, con­ versely, was rejected as unworthy of analysis because the stories told by advertising, cinema and the then emerging form of television were thought to be constructed with so little precision, and their effects so simple, that any academic attention was undeserving. Barthes, however, realised that the mass media ought to be taken ser­ iously, and his 1957 essay collection, Mythologies, stands as one of the first attempts to evaluate the finesse and impact of mass media narratives. Indeed, Barthes Mythologies revels in popular culture, analysing anything and everything from wrestling…

the value-laden and selective realities that are offered in language appear to be natural, and thus the way in which the world really is. It may be noted that Barthes' work on narrative, similarly, is concerned with the structural conventions that a story must obey, if, paradoxically, it is to appear to the reader as if it was unfolding, not according to a convention, but rather naturally (Barthes 1977b). In Mythologies, in particular, Barthes analyses the way in which a second, 'mythological', level of meaning is added onto signs. The signs under investigation are not only linguistic signs, but also any carriers of meaning, including photographs and other visual images. Myth, for Barthes, works by allowing a particular image to reinforce our preju- dices, making them appear to have universal validity. A particular image (or signifier) is fused with a value system (which, at t…

lot of recent work in linguistics and cultural studies has shown. Roland Barthes's Mythologies (Paris, 1957) is a good example of how a second level of symbolization in Hasan's sense can be discovered in journalism, advertising and indeed non-verbal spectacles such as striptease and wrestling. All one can say to reinforce Hasan's theory is that the literary text invites this kind of interpretation, and indeed requires it for its completion, whereas the nonliterary text does not invite it, and is in effect destroyed by it. When Barthes, for example, analyses the contrasting rhetorical strategies used in advertisements for cleaning fluids and detergents ('The implicit legend of [chlorinated fluid] rests on the idea of a violent, abrasive modification of matter; the connotations are of a chemical or mutilating type: the product "kills" the dirt. Powders, on the contrary, are separating agents: their ideal

to both Saussure and Lévi-Strauss, for instance, through his continued use of mythological codes.Yet, in this essay, Barthes also makes clear the need to com- bine the scientific study of texts with more sociological understandings of mean- ing and practice. For Barthes, a full analysis of modern mythologies can only be undertaken once deeper structures are aligned with specific social, cultural and economic forms (for example, capitalism and capitalist ideology). In Mythologies Barthes begins to move structuralism away from the over- formalized approach developed by Lévi-Strauss: instead, he combines abstract analysis of underlying structures with more impressionistic assessments of social context.This move is taken further in his later work, notably S/Z, which com- prises a detailed analysis of the story ‘Sarrasine’ by Balzac (Barthes, 1975). In the study,Barthes identifies five codes …

book is somewhat naive, implying that a kind of pure, pre-mythic signi­ fication is possible. This presupposes a natural link between the signifier and signified which constitute the denotative sign. The development of semiology increasingly exposed the contradiction of a science based on systematicity and differentiation whilst still attempting to operate the distinction between denotation and connotation. It demonstrated in­ creasingly that the connotative system is an integral part of the signify­ ing system that gives intelligibility to each sign. Barthes’s Syst 'eme de la mode eventually showed how both denotation and connotation are inseparable in the functioning of the system of fashion. Semiology, then, aims to give an account of the structure of meaning of social practices and objects, like furniture, table manners, chess, etc. The initial systematisation of the method of this semiology was provided by Barthes’s Elements of Semiology, originally published in

Barthes’s Mythologies were originally magazine articles in Lettres nou- velles, written between 1952 and 1956. They are published with a post­ face, ‘Myth today’, which systematises their intuitive method in terms of Saussurean linguistics. The analysis of myth was for him ‘the begin­ ning of semiology’: it explains how the ruling ideas of a social forma­ tion come to seem universal and natural. It therefore joins the analysis of ideology which is proposed by Marx and Engels in their early text The German Ideology: Each class which puts itself in the place of the one ruling before it, is compelled, merely in order to carry through its aim, to represent its interests as the common interests of all members of society, that is, expressed in an ideal form: it has to give its ideas the form of uni­ versality, and represent them as the only rational, universally valid ones (Marx and Engels, The German Ideology, pp. 64—5).

Understanding Media Semiotics﻿ 2 Goals of the present volume The academic study of the media traces its roots to America in the 1930s. It was not until the late 1950s, however, that semiotics ventured into this domain of investigation. That was the decade in which the French semioti­ cian Roland Barthes (1915–80) showed, for the first time, the importance of studying media in terms of how they generate meanings. Semiotic method, as Barthes argued in his 1957 masterpiece Mythologies, is fundamental because, unlike other approaches to media, it focuses almost exclusively on hidden meanings. Incredibly, only a handful of textbooks of “media semiotics” à la Barthes have come forward since the late 1950s. A large part of the reason for this is the fact that semiotics has never really found a niche in the academic landscape and, therefore, that very few “full-time” professional pract…

that the “mystical character of commodities does not originate in their use value” or indeed to any inherent property of the commodities themselves.57 Divorced from origin, the commodity is enveloped in the mysterious fog of ideology. Marx’s mythopoetic analysis can be rendered compatible with Roland Barthes’s sensual, bodily semiotics in Mythologies. Barthes understood products and commodities as being part of a larger chain of signification. Barthes argues that all media has language and that language is myth as language gives and gifts meaning to objects, shaping environs with significance and ritualistic layers. If language is myth (in Barthes’s sense of imbuing meaning to the world), myth (in the more classical sense of ancient stories) can be used also as language to interpret the world, providing the coordinates of shared meaning. But both Marx and Barthes recognize that…

Barthes suggests further that the author ‘ought at least to know the inner “thing” he thinks to “translate” is itself only a ready-formed dictionary, its words only explainable through other words, and so on indeﬁnitely’.187 In these remarks, Barthes is developing the implications of an approach to language similar to Derrida's. Although he deals speciﬁcally with literature, his remarks clearly apply also to other art forms. Any attempt at an authentic or unique conﬁguration of signs in thought or in representation is merely a shifting play within that sign-system as a whole. It is a mixing of idioms already laid down. Recent ‘postmodern’ developments in the visual arts ostensibly manifest this very fact in so far as they self-consciously combine different stylistic tendencies or modes of representation and material in the space of a single picture. The work of Julian Schnabel and David …

Course: Ink, general linguistics ‘I had just read Saussure.’ These words appear in the second preface to Mythologies, which Barthes added in 1970 to reflect upon the original time and tenor of the book: This book has a double theoretical framework: on the one hand, an ideological critique bearing on the language of so-­called mass culture; on the other, a first attempt to analyse semiologically the mechanics of this language. I had just read Saussure and as a result acquired the conviction that by treating ‘collective representations’ as sign-­systems, one might hope to go further than

1996: 148). My main focus in the current chapter, though, will be on issues of signification or meaning construction, as well as on related issues of taste and cultural value (which are more closely associated with and more explicitly addressed by a critical, cultural studies perspective on media and communica- tions in modern society). I begin and end here by referring to the work of Roland Barthes (see especially Barthes 1973; 1984), starting with an account of his influential, but ultimately flawed, analysis of French popular cultural images in the 1950s and 1960s, and finishing with a discussion of some personal reflec- tions that he offers much later on the medium of photography. In between these sections, my commentary charts a series of conceptual developments in ‘social-semiotic theory’ that serve to draw our attention to different dimensions of signification, textuality and soci…

STRUCTURALISM AND SEMIOTICS 13 FURTHER READING Barthes, Roland (1990b) S/Z, trans. Richard Miller, Oxford: Blackwell. This book is, as its preface states, the trace of work done during a two-year seminar (1968–9) at the École pratique des Hautes Études. While it provides some interesting principles of structuralist analysis, it is nonetheless an extremely close reading of Balzac’s novella line by line. It is, perhaps, the implications of Barthes’ painstaking reading which remain of interest to students today. Barthes, Roland (1993) Mythologies, trans. Annette Lavers, London: Vintage. This is a highly readable and engaging text which outlines Barthes’ theory of the structure of ‘myth’ as well as offering a series of short essays on aspects of French bourgeois culture as examples of how the theory may be used to engage with the everyday. These essays range from readings of advertisements for soap powder, through wrestling matches, to an exhibition of photographs entitled ‘The Great

thought runs through Barthes’s texts – or, to be more precise, in texts written by Barthes after his discovery of Ferdinand de Saussure’s Course in General Linguistics. Sade, Fourier, Loyola, for instance, denounces ‘the old modern myth according to which language is merely the docile and insignificant instrument for the serious things that occur in the spirit, the heart or the soul’ (SFL, 39). A Lover’s Discourse, meanwhile, spurns the advances of what it calls ‘the illusion of expressivity’ (LD, 98), and Sollers Writer shines light upon the way in which a text like H halts the notion that language is merely ‘used to transmit ideas or information’ (SW, 84). In ‘Variations sur l’écriture’ lie the playful words, ‘Writing, expression of personality? Really? I myself have three writings, according to which I write texts, take notes, or correspond’ (OC IV, 280), while a letter to Michel Butor dated 2 March 1962 denounces Robert Kanters as an ‘idiot’

up in this stead. Preconditions Indeed, when one wishes to speak about the forms and contents that are the subject of generalized social communication, the main difficulty encountered is not in the multiplicity and the variety of their manifestations, which at first glance appear to be limitless. From this very point of view, Roland Barthes's Mytholo- gies have long been a relatively extensive inventory but in fact these essays actu- ally should be considered as determining a common semantic place that gives a social basis and founds the internal coherence of a semiotic universe, thus ac- counting for social discourse, which is both complex and simple. This is more or less taken for granted when we speak about ethnoliterature. Although it is pos- sible to situate it within the framework of archaic or archaistic societies, the con- cept cannot be transposed and mechanically applied…

discourse that incorporates these activities. In our own times, with the advent of semiotics (perhaps most decisively after Roland Barthes’ popular book Mythologies), and the subsequent emergence of cultural studies, performance studies, visual culture studies and their vicissitudes, the procedures once reserved for the discussion and illumination of artworks have been aimed at everyday objects and practices, often in order to divulge the operation and/or signiﬁcance—frequently said to be primarily ideological in nature—of quotidian phenomena, such as the language and role-playing of the female escorts at dating services. Yet what distinguishes the application of the subroutines of the art criticism of yesteryear from their deployment in the arena of inquiries like cultural studies today? The answer cannot be simply that art criticism takes art as its object, and that semiotics, cultural studies, et al. do not, since these latter-day inquiries sometimes do elect to focus

the shift from Barthes’s analysis of dominant discourses to his later concern for the subject of that discourse. They also wish for the scientific rigor of the early Barthes and find the late Barthes too personal. Behind this second critique lies an assumption about which forms of writing are better for com- municating about literature. But for Barthes, it would be illogical to eluci- date the pleasures of art from a neutral and abstract viewpoint because the fragments used to elaborate on the text of jouissance are part of the mes- sage conveyed about the erotics of rupture. In talking about the dispersed self, Barthes must reflect the unorganized and nonintegrated environment through a resistance to coherence and hierarchical structure. In addition to dismissing the form of Barthes’s late works, Culler and Eagleton challenge his focus on a more local analysis of the subject’s use of the semiotic systems that Barthes considered in his early career.

as the old formulas of romantic narrative, Mail employs multiple discourses that may be analysed via Barthes’ articulation of the mythologies and codes of the text. MYTH In ‘Myth Today’ Barthes draws on Saussure’s distinction between the sig- niﬁer, signiﬁed and sign in order to explain the workings of language. He illustrates the meaning and relation of these terms using the rose. The rose may operate as a signiﬁer that is used to convey a signiﬁed, which is passion, and the two together (the signiﬁer and signiﬁed) create the sign: ‘passioniﬁed’ rose (Barthes 2000: 113). Another example may help clarify. Take the word woman. The word, ‘woman’, just the sound of the word, without any content or attached meaning, is the signiﬁer. The sig- niﬁed, however, is not the female person to whom I might point before me. Rather, the signiﬁed is the concept or idea of woman that I imagine. It is the image of woman – an image that, in Western culture, includes

vi Preface and sign-based constructions (texts, rituals, etc.), which then allow us to reflect upon them consciously, rather than just intuitively. This book will not utilize the complex theoretical apparatus of semiotics, but rather its broader perspective of seeking to understand what love means through a consideration of the forms used to represent it (language, narratives, poetry, symbolism, rituals, etc.). It is written for a general readership, but with an eye towards making the study of love an area of interest among semioticians as well, given that there is, as of yet, no extensive semiotic treatment of this topic. The bril- liant 1977 work by the late French semiotician Roland Barthes, A Lover’s Discourse: Fragments, is not, strictly speaking, a semiotic study. It consists of a list of “fragments” that Barthes selected from literature and philosophy in order to provide pensées on love from various viewpoints.

Malinowski, L. Strauss for variations of the theory (pp.39-45). R. Barthes introduced the semiotic approach of mythology, which viewed myth as a ‘metalanguage,’ a linguistic version of the reality behind the myth (p.53). Also, see pp.68-75 for the theory of M.P. Nilsson who argued that all myths were traceable to the Mycenaean period. On page 110, Graf wrote: ‘the relationship between myths and the institutions that they purport to explain requires closer explanation. Not every ritual, cult statue, or temple was explained by an aition;’ also, see K. Dowden 1999: 221-243 on the relation between ritual and mythology and S.I. Johnston 2003: 156f. who advises caution in associating initiatory myths with particular festivals or rituals. 22 In lyric poetry, we often read about the love life of gods or heroes and we must assume that it was a source of knowledge for Alexandrian scholars who were interested in rare versions of the Homeric myths (see

by a truck while crossing the road. The ‘Struggle with an Angel’ reveals that no canon, image or text was out-of-bounds for Barthes: this was at the heart of Picard’s dis- pute with Barthes, and also one of the reasons for the latter’s overall success. The most infamous convergence of image and text is Barthes’ Mythologies (1957) a collection of previously published essays from Les Lettres Nouvelles that critique the ‘ideological abuse’ created by the media which presents images of society as somehow ‘natural’ and un- historical; Barthes, taking a diverse range of subjects – such as wrest- ling, the face of Garbo, margarine – reveals that the so-called natural meaning is, in fact, a delusional myth.5 Critics have argued about the results of the approach taken in Mythologies: on the one hand, the maintenance of an ideological position, Barthes argues, depends upon the general public accepting societies’ myths; on the other hand,

french theory and criticism: 1945 and after 201 The application of literary- critical practices to social or historical phenomena is also evident in the work of Barthes, whose Mythologies (1957) combines acute aes- thetic sensibilities with an ability to improvise with semiological categories derived from linguistics. In Roland Barthes: The Professor of Desire (1983), Steven Ungar notes that “instead of concentrating on the objective forms of [pop u lar myths], Barthes analyzes how they are produced, circulated, and exchanged— in other words, how myths manipulate the pro cesses of meaning in order to create what purport to reﬂ ect collective conceptions of reality and ‘human nature’ ” (21). Here, Barthes’s mode of analysis depends largely on a talent for grasping inferences and details in a way char- acteristic of literary and art critics. Barthes demonstrates, for example, how …

of Barthes’ Mourning Diaries in 2009 provides further proof, laid out in exemplary fashion by Neil Badmington (2012), that Barthes was first pricked by the punctum in the cinema, on trips to watch William Wyler’s The Little Foxes, Christian Gion’s One Two Two and Hitchcock’s Under Capricorn. The origins of Barthes’ idea of the punctum therefore lie in cinema, confirming the authenticity and validity of a film critical practice that pays metonymic attention to the detail. III Veering from Borges I began this book by departing from Proust; I want to end it by veering from Borges.

symbolically (semiotically) controls this tearing. He thus attempted to constitute the concrete object of a learning whose variety, multiplicity, and mobility allow him to ward off the saturation of old discourses. This knowledge is in a way already a writing, a text. (93) Here, as throughout this essay, Kristeva highlights Barthes’s studious regard for the “literary ‘machine’ ” as something demanding a critical inquiry that is specialized without being disciplinarily discrete. In conse- quence, this approach produces a “knowledge” that is never as absolute as the presumptive knowledge gained by a positivist science or even a lit- erary criticism with scientific pretensions. Along with questioning the borders between disciplines, in other words, comes an important chal- lenge to assumptions about what delimits the literary “object” itself and about just what sort of operations it involve…

in the myth is that it creates a second-degree semiology, characterized by the sign, the signiﬁer, and the signiﬁcance that are transferred to a new associative relation between concept and picture. Barthes emphasizes how a semiological system, as a mythology, contains the possibility of naturalizing the myth.30 In this way, the myth transforms history into nature so that the myth is considered as an expression of a kind of eternal, natural reason, and is taken to be a factual truth. The myth is a language that rationalizes the concept. It is an interpretation of an object language that creates a new system of connotation. In this sense, poetic language ﬁghts with mythological language, because modern poetry—in contrast to classical poetry—seeks to escape the mythological function. Modern poetry wants to create new connotations beyond the semiology of language, while the myths are founded on a semiological naturalization of the

whose center lies one of the most enigmatic literary works of modernity, Gustave Flaubert’s (1821–1880) La Tentation de Saint Antoine. He sees the semiotic per- spective as the most apt at seizing the deep anthropological value of this intertex- tual maze. Flaubert’s Tentation represents a series of temptations; it meta-repre- sents the temptations of the sacred and the paradoxical interplay between the force of creativity and the form of creation, triggering a reflection on its existen- tial meaning. Leone examines these temptations in six steps, revealing that grasping the essence of the temptation Flaubert dealt with means coming to terms with the semiotic nucleus of ritual. (Interpretations by Barthes, Foucault, Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) and the opposition between Flaubert and Nietzsche are of particular relevance.) It is through repetition of forms through time that the force of creativity with its potential for disruption and madness

The texts that make up Roland Barthes's oeuvre resist any summarizing gesture. Continually shift­ ing between methodologies, theoretical vocabul­ aries, and writing styles, Barthes's texts are themselves vehicles for elaborating and testing the connections between his chief preoccupations: history, textuality, and pleasure. Barthes's first major work, Writing Degree Zero (1 953), is a defense of linguistic and stylistic experimentation. A response to Jean-Paul Sartre's VV!zat is Literature? ( 1 94 7), in which Sartre suggests that in order to write politically one should use a plain style and language, Writing Degree Zero details a theoretical framework which combines avant-garde aesthetics with revolutionary politics: experimenta­ tion itself is recognized as political. Barthes makes a distinction between "language," the set of combi­ natory possibilities shared by the speakers of a language; "style," a subject's private vocabulary

35 Barthes’s ‘third meaning’ is precisely an attempt to evade this functioning of semiotic analysis, to depart from his earlier account of the ‘Rhetoric of the Image’. This is an attempt that leads him towards analysing film in terms of an ‘obtuse’ deconstructive trace. The obtuse meaning disturbs the assurance of critical metalanguage. This is because it is the signifier for which there is no signified, which cannot be reduced to its meaning (signification). It is the metonymy (the angle of a beard) which cannot be lent a metaphorical Notes 125

lectoral, in Roland Barthes sense, is the vector of attention, we might insist, even in works he once called illisible (Stewart 2007: 68-70), by which he was referring to the teasing phantom alphabets mastered by Michaux or Saul Steinberg (or even, one finds, Picasso) that Barthes himself also experimented with. But by the notion of lectorship I woidd mean, more broadly, those various instances, sculptural as well as lexigraphic, in which the shape of textual mediation, depurposed and turned (inward) upon itself, transmediates its own former (or still latent) verbal purport into a different tropological system. This is where meaning still borrows from the literary (and its wordplay) in Between Print Matter and Page Matter 67 the absence of script or grammar, making even spewed polymer art silently articulate by way of retinal metaphor.

INTRODUCTION 20 Roland Barthes provides a typically provocative epigram for the belief of a whole range of contemporary approaches: ‘in the text, only the reader speaks’ (1975, p. 151). The meanings of the text are realized or constituted by readers, on the basis of their knowledge of the semiotic codes which the culture makes available for texts to signify, and on the basis of their background knowledge of the world, and their beliefs, which allow the realization of references, and inferencing. Now, as with any communication, there is never a complete matching of codes and knowledge between participants; in the case of literary texts, the gap between writer and reader may be very wide because of the practice of preserving and valuing highly texts which are historically and culturally distant from the situation of the modern reader. Literary education provides tutored experience of a ran…

the eyes, like a trigger of the imagination, which is why this semiology (need I specify once more: the semiology of the speaker) is not a hermeneu- tics: it paints more than it digs, via di porre rather than via de levare. Its objects of predilection are texts of the Image-making process: narratives, images, portraits, expressions, idiolects, passions, structures which play simultaneously with an appearance of verisimilitude and with an uncer- tainty of truth. I should like to call ‘semiology’ the course of operations during which it is’ possible — even called for - to play with the sign as with a painted veil, or again, with a fiction. This pleasure of the imaginary sign is conceivable now due to certain recent mutations, which affect culture more than society itself: the use we can make of the forces of literature I have mentioned is modified by a new situation.

the reader’s bodily bêtise to which one relates via the fantasy. The knowledge the reader obtains about oneself via the intervention of the fantasy ultimately makes possible the image of a future self-as-oeuvre, a program that Barthes, with a gesture toward Dante, called the vita nuova. For the compilation of such an encyclopaedia, during his lec- tures at the Collège Barthes did use, although not explicitly, some classic concepts of literary theory, such as the literary space, the detail in literary description, time—both internal to the text (narratology) and external to the text (history of literature)—and finally (and sur- prisingly), the author. I will devote a chapter to each of these notions, addressing briefly the (often privileged) position they occupy in Barthes’ earlier work and how he, in his Cours, redefined them. In this way I would like to use Barthes’ own trajectory as a case study in or- der to investigate how these notions might be integrated in a reading

cluding the psychological and ideological positioning of the ﬁctional nar- rator in relation to the story being told. In contrast, he deﬁnes the text as the language of that literature, which is unanchored to the ﬁction and produces its own autonomous, constantly changing systems of meaning. Unlike the work, text for Barthes is never predetermined; rather, it is always in process and always in production.6 Barthes, of course, primarily applies text to linguistic wordplay at the sentence level, but Bakhtin, de- spite his stated antipathy toward linguistics, uses it in much the same general way, shaping the notion of text to his own theories of language and discourse. Bakhtin’s reconception of text to include dialogical discourse premises my own narrative analysis. In “The Problems of the Text,” Bakhtin distin- guishes two “poles” of text. The ﬁrst pole consists of a system of signs that i…

texts themselves, in ideological or psychological forces. Rather, Barthes’s study proposes a sort of structural anthropology of the Racinian world, as he analyses the signifying system underlying each of the plays. He ﬁnds in them a consistent setting – the antechamber posed between an inner sanctuary and the outside world – and a consistent set of charac- ters playing out variants of what Barthes describes as a ‘fundamental relationship’ (la relation fondamentale). He provocatively represents this relationship in the form of what he calls ‘a double equation’: A has all power over B. A loves B, who does not love A.9 Pushing the analysis ever further, Barthes shows how Racine’s plays revolve around the same drama of authority, involving the father and his son, the king and his subject, and ultimately God and his creature. Even on this cursory account of new critical readings of Racine, it should be apparent how very different they are in tone and content Impostures of French theory 13

may very well not show them at all; it takes the spectator outside its frame, and it is there that I animate this photograph and that it animates me. (Camera 58–59) According to Barthes, this animation is possible because his experience of the visual is tactile. Rather than insisting on the distance between the photograph and him- self, Barthes proposes to focus on embodied methods of interpretation. To develop this tactile method for reading photography, Barthes relies on the concept of punctum. The punctum is the detail or portion of a photograph that “rises from the scene, shoots out of it like an arrow, and pierces” the viewer (26). The punctum catches the viewer’s attention by accident and “pricks” and “bruises” him or her (43). Barthes’s use of metaphors reveals that the punctum is tactile and induces movement. In that sense, it triggers a 2. This excess in Barthes’s model resembles Kristeva’s Semiotic. Barthes’s and Kristeva’s

is right, and thus presents a strong argument for the “progressive” view of lit- erature. But, as we have already discussed, there are other views of litera- ture, including the idea that working within a tradition or a genre is also a wor- thy approach. The hard Barthesian ideas about originality seem to contradict Barthes’s own “The Death of the Author.” But these positions can be reconciled if we note that Barthes is trying to link not so much the Author but the conventions of discourse, particularly of writing. Barthes’s radical politics come through in his semiology, the study of signs. In trying to found this discipline, Barthes argued that bourgeois society impos- es symbolic meanings upon signs in order to force its values onto others. Those who dislike bourgeois society will find this sinister. Others will not. But later scholars did draw upon Barthes to argue that the imposition of symbolic order is not only based on class, but also on race, gender, and sexuality.

three (5–7) deal with the history of theorizing the sign or image in specific reli- gious contexts for the sake of contributing to general semiotic theory and its his- tory. The others (8–12) analyze religious phenomena (or cases of religious signif- icance) with semiotic tools. Some case studies are completely or partially studies of specific texts (5, 7–8, 10–12), while other case studies completely or partially deal with other media and modes (7–12).

Augustine’s inspiration for discussing this issue so extensively lies in the idea of the image or likeness of God. Gramigna investigates the intercon- nection between the concepts of image, verisimilitude and falsity. This provides

tance to which the difﬁculty of avant-garde French thought has contin- ued to give rise. So the interest of this controversy is not only historical; it also raises still pertinent questions about interpretative validity and academic authority, and it reveals aspects of the structure of intellectual controversy which we will ﬁnd repeated very precisely in relation to Impostures intellectuelles. One of the most intriguing aspects of all this is the entanglement of opposing discourses. As we have seen, Picard repeats some of the failings of which he accuses Barthes: misreading, generalizing from limited evidence, quoting out of context, making dog- matic assertions rather than reasoned arguments. If Barthes is a poor reader of Racine, Picard is certainly a poor reader of Barthes, and the similarities here look too consistent to be merely a product of chance. It is as if the discourses of the opponents are fatally bound up with one

On the other hand, if we ask how a wide- ranging whole of speculative knowledge that yet coheres in one principle can best be rendered intelligible, we might be equally justiﬁed in saying that many a book would have been clearer if it had not tried to be so very clear. Te reader does not arrive quickly enough at an overview of the whole, and the bright colours of illustrations hide and distort the articu- lation and organization of the system, which, afer all, matte…

works mentioned so far, it is also deeply rooted in that practice of historicist intertextuality and methodological alertness of which Ezio Raimondi is perhaps the most effective repre­ sentative in Italy.16 In fact, I believe that through the model provided by Raimondi it is possible to understand my own present research as the logical development of my earlier in­ quiries into thematic, structural, and symbolic fields, precisely because semiotics helps to understand how themes, struc­ tures, and symbols function in a broad cultural context, that is to say, how they become vehicles of communication. But before this introductory overview turns into a kind of autobibliography, I will shift my attention to the notions and problems that are dealt with at a theoretical level in the works mentioned so far, which are assumed here as cornerstones of my own critical discourse. In doing so, my intention is not to offer a theoretical system of my own, but rather to single

is the construction of an alternative reality by manipulating the relation between asetof signs(whether linguistic ornon-linguistic) as ‘message’ and the context or frame of that message. As Bateson argues in Steps to an Ecology of Mind, the same behaviour can be ‘framed’ by a shift in context which then requires very different interpretative procedures. The same set of actions performed in a ‘play’ context will not denote what they signify in a non-play context. Roland Barthes demonstrates this very entertainingly in his analysis of wrestling in Mythologies. The sport is praised for its ‘semiotic’ as opposed to ‘mimetic’ construction of meaning, its flaunting of its status as play. The spectators are never deluded into believing that a ‘real’ fight is taking place; they are kept constantly aware that it is a spectacle: only an image is involved in the game, and the spectator does not wi…

Introduction 27 ten overcrowded, impersonal auditorium in France’s most prestigious academic institution. It was clear that the transition intimidated Barthes, particularly insofar as it happened at the same time as the ill- ness and subsequent death of his mother, with whom he had lived to- gether his entire life. Traces of his mourning and his doubts can be found in the notes that sometimes seem rather flat and uninspired, es- pecially in comparison with the rest of Barthes’ work. And yet the four years in which Barthes taught at the Collège de France are still worthy of attention, and for three reasons: First, because they show how the respective fantasies that Barthes chose each year as starting point for his lectures can be traced retroactively to Barthes’ earlier work, shining a new light on that ear- lier work. This is also nicely illustrates Barthes’ own proposition that every bit of reading, regardless how objective it seems to be, is deter-

Following the shape of my argument, the chapters in this book are grouped into two parts. The first part presents an analysis of the Zeuxis narrative. I begin by explaining the relevance of myths and legends about artistic creation for the study of visual culture. While long-lived legends such as those of Veronica's Veil, St. Luke Painting the Virgin, Pygmalion and Galatea, the Corinthian Maid, and Apelles Painting Campaspe contrib- ute to our understanding of the history of Western art, the legend of Zeuxis Selecting Models stands apart. Zeuxis Selecting Models taps into the un- conscious history of art. In chapter 1 I also present an account of classi- cal mimesis. As acknowledged by the writings of Plato, Xenophon, and Aristotle, classical mimesis became a privileged mode of representation

Ces notations ne doivent pas se confondre avec le constat que des œuvres mêlent explicitement les deux – ainsi des œuvres du réalisme magi- que, ainsi des œuvres du récit poétique.

He explains the functions and the locations of punctum and studium, and he also points out that by chance punctum and studium may co-exist in one photograph. Marianne Hirsh borrows Barthes’ ideas of punctum and studium and further interprets the relationship between the spectator and the photos.

Introduction: Semiotics of Digital Culture xvii Part I here (and also Colombari 2019: 30–38 for the same critique from the side of Italo-French semiotics). From my perspective, the most essential point is that the text as a methodological instrument presupposes a work on a dead body. Text is a discourse ﬁxed in a written form where the usefulness of the results of textual analysis relies on the assumption that the text always remains the same. When Eco claims that the text is a lazy machine, this is a euphemism. The life of the interpretative process is entirely the duty of the reader (Eco 1979: 24) and not the author whose narrative strategy has been ﬁxed once and forever. After ﬁxation, the author is “dead”. For Barthes, “the death of the author” is a methodological assumption with great impact on the advent of textualism (Barthes 1975 and 1977). In a much more speciﬁc way when Ricœur …

wrought from consonant and vowel. Barthes reads each in terms of the other, his own writing playful and teasing, incisive and erudite, fully aware of its own onanistic pleasures and the degree to which it was driven above all by the simple need to know. In fact, his is the perfect rewriting of Genesis: it too is an originary myth about the temptations of pleasure and knowledge – albeit without an omnipotent God and his satanic counterpart – in which language itself assumes the central role. Barthes’s temptation occurs not in a single action – a mistake, a transgression, a fall – but instead as the condition of possibility for knowledge itself, knowledge that is inseparable from the

suggest that we bracket the whole question of science and scientificity in Greimas, and think of the body of texts that follow, as we do for other "structuralisms" or "poststructuralisms," as a code, an idiolect, a theoretical private language among many others resonating through the airspace of the contemporary public sphere. Let us therefore initially think of the "concepts" of Greimassian semiotics rather as a specific nomenclature, as a fresh and idiosyncratic, arbitrary, violent, often unlovely renaming of a whole space and collection of objects already familiar to us under other names and in different installations or perspectives: actants, narra- tive contracts, narrative programs, isotopies, modalizations, cataphora, and finally that peculiar act of nomination (the semiotic square) that is less a name than a visual articulation, a new hieroglyph (which then carries its t…

wherein it is proposed that the study of signs as providing the means for speculative and practical knowledge alike may hold the key to understanding aright the nature and extent of human knowledge. As the modern period in philosophy reached its end, a more judicious assessment was made by Charles Sanders Peirce. But this we will have occasion to see at length when we reach chapter 15. Here it is enough to observe that Locke's proposal for semiotic, once seen against the backdrop of Poinsot's Tractatus de Signis, surely appears as one of history's confluences within the Zeitgeist of the seventeenth century, revealing as it does that the very problem exercising modern thought in its rejection of Latin immersion in Aristotelian philosophy of nature was the problem on which Poinsot brought all the resources of Latin tradition to bear, namely, the problem, as Locke put it,122 of "the way and proportion that objects are suited to

Roland Barthes (1915–1980) This French structuralist offers us one way into putting the terminology of Saussure and Peirce into action, whilst offering more specialist vocabulary of his own. Barthes’ close analysis of both literature and products of popular culture was an attempt to expose the under- lying conservative or bourgeois ideology of what he was studying. In Mythologies (1957), he explores adverts for soap powder, kinds of food, movies and other aspects of popular culture. In ‘The Romans In Films’ he describes Joseph Mankiewicz’s Julius Caesar (1953) and the haircuts of the characters; the fringe signiﬁes the Roman nation- ality. Even though the actor is American, this particular hairstyle symbolises a nationality and a place: Caesar’s Rome as interpreted by Hollywood via Shakespeare. Further,the characters,except for Julius Caesar,sweat as a sign of their moral state.Caesar is immune to sweating because he is the object of intrigue,rather than a plotter

master-practitioners of the Textual? A tree is judged by its fruits, and the semiological apple branch has produced its share of delectables. Barthes made a true writer's oeuvre out of criticism. And a comely come-on, The Name of the Rose, became a mas­ terpiece. How can one ward off the impression that the savoriness of the creative or fictional impulse in such works laughs at its counter, learnedness? Or that this emotion or this verve, this subtle tristfulness or this gaya scienza (depending on whether one reads Barthes or listens to Eco) owes so little to esprit de systeme. It does happen that rhetoricians can be better than their rhetoric. Here intuitions exceed method. Fragments of a Lover's Discourse or Camera Lucida do not seem really to draw from the same wellsprings as the Elements of Semiology or The System of Fashion. As if whatever depth was contained in the aes…

Preface as enigma. Unlike the oedipal text Barthes takes as his model, the pre- oedipal text is marked by the nonsynchronicity of closure and the ex- haustion of the riddle. The smiles of the Sphinx allegorizes by its insis- tent plural the feminocentric text's, but also the female reader's resistance to closure and resolution. The essay on Maupassant, which while centered on Une Vie takes into account his entire fictional oeuvre, examines the validity for feminocen- tric texts of another supposedly universal law: the primordial role of the paternal signifier in the formation of the speaking subject according to Jacques Lacan. Read with the heightened attention to the signifier and its insistence Lacanism requires, Maupassant's texts appear to be in- formed by the anagrammatization of the name not of his father but of his mother. René Girard's sacrificial scenario—yet another ge…

theorists and writers not only on the level of paraphrasable knowledge and argument but also on the level of the "'heterological" materiality of the signifier itself. 2 I stress "to the extent that it does work" because, as a student of Barthes, Bataille, and Beckett, I am attracted to Barthes's shift of val- ue away from the work of textual meaning to the pleasure of the text and "'the sumptuous rank of the signifier" (Pleasure 65); I am drawn to Bataille's discursive subversion of utility, his disruption of the work of knowledge and argument through "unproductive expenditure"; and I am intrigued by the Beckettian possibility of what Leo Bersani calls a "'culturally nonviable" discursive practice, one that never ceases to affirm its own inadequacy and invalidity.3 At the same time, however, I am embarrassed by the political lia- bilities of this seemingly perverse attraction …

the relationship between the terms Negro, poiēsis, and humanism. The focus of that attention is the indicial force of the nominative. Names do more than des- ignate ­things; they indicate an orientation in life, not in some abstract nomi- nalist sense, but in the sense of a grammar that emerges out of a set of ­human practices in life that work in the creation of the world. In this sense, they are material indices of a par­tic­u­lar semiosis. And, as ­shall be argued throughout this work, they may well be indices of multiplicious semiosis, a dynamics referred to ­here as para-­semiosis. Giving a full account of what para-­semiosis means is the work of Sentient Flesh. The ­thing to keep in mind at this moment is the issue of what the usages of Negro and poiēsis have to do with each other and humanism as designators. The focus ­here is on the relationship between poiēsis and humanism; or rather, it is on a certain history of knowledge that

We know, for example, that narrative analysis of folktales leaves the problem of motifs hanging. Motifs are mobile sequences that can be substituted for each other to fill the same narrative functions. They also can assume different functions and appear as autonomous variants or as independent stories. The distinction be- tween two levels of semiotiC organization- narrative and figurative- theoreti- cally allows us to remove this problem by, among other things, explaining the structural permanence of stories and intertextual migrations of motifs. A better knowledge of discoursive configurations also allows us more pre- cisely to situate the scientific enterprise represented by the work of Georges Dumezil. This comparative grammarian's tour de force is a new comparative mythology. Essentially this consists of a transfer to the level of the signified of the methodological procedure…

It is the explicit purpose of this book to show the variety of negative contexts open to critical interpretation, insofar as such contexts may be related directly to specific readings of specific texts. Though, as discussed earlier, such a goal has inescapable metaphysical and onto- theological dimensions, it has been my purpose in collecting these essays to focus on the pragmatic aspects of what negation theory is and how it can be useful in the critical and theoretical enterprise-that is, to focus on critica…

erations. In his Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes , he had noticed in his family photos the recurrence of a certain pensive position of the elbow, one that seemed passed down from father to father. No doubt Barthes thought about the bequeathing of hand positions as he played, looking at his grandmother’s ﬁ ngerings on the score. Such markings do not so much resemble signs as they do traces. They put the current player into a nostalgic relation to time and call upon his imagination of signs: An earlier player had been pres- ent in front of this score, and Barthes experiences with his hands the absence and presence of his grandmother. In his Camera Lu- cida , he captured the noeme of photography with the phrase ça a été , that has been : a relation to time presupposed by any printed image. In keeping with Sartre, he observed the paradox in which the imagination can make an object present without our being able

Music is a “continuous big bang .” Semiology must step aside in order to give way to this chaos. Even though it is unreadable, this chaos inheres even in the most seemingly harmo- nious music. The greatest surprise we ﬁ nd in Barthes the pianist now comes into view: This most reﬁ ned and sharpest analyst of sign-systems loved music precisely because it freed him from codes and dis- courses. Rather than being attracted to the structures of music, he gave himself over to passions without language when playing the piano. He sought the imaginary excess of the body more than any measurement of sound-spaces. His passions did not require any theatricality or grand declarations in the style of Artaud about the deposition of the Word or the subversion of the organless body. These passions arise in our ordinary lives of shared feelings and

that gives her discourse its political purpose and its gravity, and which makes of these seminars the continuation of the project of Etrangers à nous mémes (1988) and Les nouvelles maladies de l’âme (1993). At the same time both volumes follow the pattern established by La révolution du langage poétique (1974) and Pouvoirs de l’horreur of a lengthy and complex theoretical (i.e. psychoanalytic) introduction which makes up nearly half of Sens and over one third of La Révolte. These are then followed by a dense exploration of specific theoretical and literary texts that they have been developed to make possible. Now Lautréaumont, Mallarmé and Céline are succeeded by Roland Barthes, Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Aragon as exemplary materials for Kristeva’s inquiries.

The text’s fragmentary form, its use of allusions, and the way it figures writing as a form of queer family-making help the text to achieve its communicative goals. Throughout the chapter, my most important interlocutors (other than Nelson) are writers and thinkers with whom Nelson herself engages in The Argonauts: Wittgenstein, Barthes, and Irigaray, as well as Judith Butler, Adam Phillips, Eve Sedgwick, and Donald Winnicott. This is a deliberate decision. It serves partly as a way of better understanding Nelson’s relationship with these thinkers but also stems from the desire to consider literature and theory (a categorical distinction that The Argonauts blurs) alongside each other, rather than one above the other. In their different modes, genres, and disciplinary
