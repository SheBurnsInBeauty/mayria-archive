explains that the experimental data of quantum physics shows that there are no pre-existing objects and subjects, but that these emerge from ‘intra-actions’, a coinage she develops because the term ‘interaction’ implies a separability the science rejects (2007: ix). The entanglements that comprise reality emerge and evolve through intra-actions, which are ongoing processes of contingent and shifting materialization. Barad’s account of quantum physics and entanglement describes the imbrication of ontology, epistemology and ethics in all human, and more-than-human, engagements with the world. Entanglement is thus key to what Barad calls ‘ethico-onto-epistemology’ (2007: 90). It not only describes what the world is made of, but conditions how we know (where knowing is inclusive of a broad range of modes of engagement that go beyond human cognition) and implies ethics as constitut…

constitute the objective referents of reality. 21. Barad, Meeting the Universe Halfway, 184. 22. I recognize Barad’s entanglement and Morton’s interconnection as highly developed ontological realisms that operate according to markedly different mecha- nisms and which are described by suitably different vocabularies. To ventriloquize: the intra-actions of agential realism’s components (apparatuses, objects, material phe- nomena) signify a mutual constitution of entangled agencies, while the components of Morton’s ecological ontology entail autonomous objects that emit demonic zones of causality, for instance. C.f. “Objects as Temporary Autonomous Zones,” Continent. 1, no. 3 (2011): 149–155. But theories of entanglement and interconnection do overlap in significant ways, not least of which is that their ethical implications pose serious problems for “representationalism, metaphysi…

I N H A B I T I N G M AT T ER 15 and feminist theorist, ﬁrst introduced the concept of intra- action in a dis- cussion of quantum physics: a ﬁeld that studies the intra- actions of the observer, the observed, and observing instruments/apparatus, all of which are “agential,” and none of which can be articulated in the absence of the other. Barad expands on these ideas in her theory of agential realism (Barad’s name for her particular brand of feminist theoretical materialism): “On my agential realist elaboration, phenomena do not merely mark the epistemo- logical inseparability of ‘observer’ and ‘observed’; rather, phenomena are the ontological inseparability of agentially intra- acting ‘components.’”38 For feminist materialist critics of technoscience like Barad, observers, tech- nological apparatuses, and what they observe do not predate their dealings with each other; because o…

temological, ontological, and ethical framework that…provides a posthu­ manist performative account of technoscientific and other natural cultural practices” (Barad 2007, 32). Barad’s agential-realism is deeply influenced by the physics/philosophy of Niels Bohr, and is founded on the concept of intra-activity. Unlike interaction, “which assumes that there are separate individual agencies that precede their interaction, the notion of intra-­ action argues that distinct agencies do not precede, but rather emerge through, their intra-action” (Barad 2007, 33). Important for Barad is the idea that there are no individuals outside of intra-action. On an ontologi­ cal level, the basic units of reality are phenomena, which she describes as “neither individual entities nor mental impressions, but entangled material agencies” (Barad 2007, 56). In one move, scientific atomism and Cartesian individualism are denied. It is not possible to “find” atomic particles just

ferently. Agential reality ‘is continually reconstituted through our material-discursive intra-actions’ (Barad, 1998: 104). Intra-actionality is constraining rather than determining; intra-actional reality remains uncertain, open to being reconﬁgured. In elaborating agential reality, Barad is bringing technology and science studies to bear on feminist theorizing of the body. For Barad bodies arise intra-actionally as phenomenon and therefore intra-actional bodies are not just a matter of shaping the surface of a body or a body’s morphology, as Butler proposed. Barad is taking up the very atoms or the very volume of bodies as non-conscious phenomena, not as a citational iteration but an intra-actional iteration (Barad, 1998: 106). For Barad, intra-actionality is how bodies materialize, how boundaries and volumes are produced. It is only through intra-action of observed and observing or me…

led to four premises: “the world is made up of actors or actants”; “no object is inherently reducible or irreducible to any other”; “the means of linking one thing to another is translation”; “actants gain in strength only through their alliances” (13, 14–15). Latour also “rejects the rift between an inner substance and its trivial exterior” (17). Latour doesn’t reduce truth to human power games, he accepts nonhumans as actors and measures reality in terms of how connected an actor is (19). Harman adds, “Any attempt to see actants as the reducible puppets of deeper structures is doomed to fail” in this understanding (21). Latour has since deployed symmetry in all of his studies, using it to avoid simplistic arguments resting on human agency. As I note elsewhere, “it’s an attempt to avoid Cartesian dichotomies by applying the same concepts and vocabularies across the entire actor-network” (Spinuzzi, Network 41). Yet, by

tion of a definite datum through the active involvement of measurer and thing measured” (Lindley 1996, 96). What, then, differentiates Barad from the correlationism of both phenomenology and quantum physics? While Barad may not provide an adequate or satisfying answer, her theory of agential realism and intra-action provide a way forward that both relies on material realism and enables measurement to occur apart from human consciousness. She mirrors Merleau-Ponty’s desire to weaken the border between the human who observes and that which is observed by focusing on the entanglement of all matter, including human consciousness. She rightly points out that “[t]he point is not simply to put the observer or knower back in the world (as if the world were a container and we needed merely to acknowledge our situatedness in it) but to understand and take account of the fact that we too are part of the world’s differential becom­

increasingly turning to Barad’s exploration of the entanglement of matter and meaning in the field of quantum physics, which reveals the liveliness of matter at the tiniest of scales.61 She describes a distributed and dynamic understanding of agency in which ‘distinct agencies do not precede but rather emerge through, their intra-action’.62 Barad uses ‘intra’ rather than ‘inter’ to emphasize that agency is shaped through encounter rather than exiting prior to it. This yields a dynamic view of matter: ‘Matter is substance in its intra-active becoming – not a thing but a doing, a congealing of agency’ (emphasis in original).63 Thus Barad claims a relational ontology in which phenomena are inseparable, always already entangled.64 She is most interested in how ‘matter makes itself felt’ as [‘it] feels, converses, suffers, desires, yearns and remembers.’65 Human persons are formed in dynamic relation to an emerging network of thingly agencies, which depend

knowledge, and objects that they would not be able to produce alone. While Barad does attribute agency beyond human consciousness, Bryant’s concept of distributed agency organizes and clarifies how agency emerges through interactions and relations. Specific inputs can only be processed by certain assemblages that are, in turn, constituted by a multitude of rela­ tions and entities. Some of these machines are agential and some of them are not. This is an important point. Bryant is not arguing for any kind of pan­ psychism and does not attribute agency to all machines. Rather, and as previously mentioned, agential machines must be able to both initiate action and act otherwise than it did. The result of this limitation is that there are millions of actions and events that do not directly result from agents. But if we do not want to rely on a crude form of Cartesian efficient causality, whereby objects merely clunk together and spin off in random

So far, we addressed law practically as one of the two things-within-phe­ nomenon. In the end, we consistently oriented our discussion here around what we named a binary model of intra-action. This particular sense of the funda­ mental Baradian concept has some value for thinking about law, especially about what the law does and how it acts. With full acknowledgment that, in AGR, one’s actions – most deﬁnitely a type of relation to others – also impact one’s very ontology, we still might say that, thus far, we did not address explicitly whether the commented framework can grasp the law as imagined in the Introduction, that is, involving a plethora of diverse entities. As can be seen below, the answer to the adequacy question posed in this book is somewhat diﬀerent in AGR’s case than in the previously considered ﬂat ontologies (with one still to follow in the next chapter). 5.4.…

ness” are not merely ideational; rather, they are speciﬁc material conﬁgurations. And the semantic and ontological indeterminacy is resolvable only through the exis- tence of a speciﬁc material arrangement that gives meaning to particular concepts to the exclusion of others, thereby eªecting a cut between “object” and “subject,” neither of which pre-exists their intra-action.7 The notion of intra-action (as opposed to the more usual “interaction,” which presumes the prior existence of independently determinate entities) entails a profound shift in the epistemologi- cal and ontological landscape, including changes in the nature of causality and agency.8 170 I KAREN BARAD

that the choice of measurement can retrospectively anticipate and actively materialize what one would have thought was already existent. The di­ lemma here is that our attempts to describe the strange outcome of this experiment can inadvertently ignore the mysterious sense of entangle­ ment, or intra-action, in the operational possibility of this “event.”9 There is a temporal configuration in the above description’s narrative order that preserves the logic of causal separation and the presumption that there are different moments in time, different places in space, and a very real differ­ ence between thought and material reality. To suggest that one affects or interferes with the other in a way that renders them inseparable doesn’t confound the nature of their difference (respective identities) so much as it emphasizes that these differences are joined or connected in someway.

in the causal explanation in order to make it plausible. Of course, one could cite the agents’ differing webs of beliefs as the differentiat- ing factor in diverse responses, but it is still possible for an agent to be moved by beliefs despite himself. Cases such as coercion and addic- tion feature an agent who is in accordance with the standard model (‘I believe the robber’s gun is loaded and I do not want to die’; ‘I am in a state of wanting and I believe that the drug will alleviate this’), but, phenomenologically, these stories do not seem to capture the real nature of human action (Frankfurt, 1988). It makes intuitive sense to say that ‘it was not me’ or ‘I wasn’t acting on my own will’ and such statements do have a legal – if not metaphysical – resonance. Coercion and addiction have been problematic for the empiricist model since Hobbes and the only real response is to say that the model of action proposed explains, but does not evaluate the actions

Thus, the emplacement of [agents] is essential to their activity, for the context makes all that occurs possible,” and concludes that “the point is not that [agents] do not make choices but that their choices are already immersed in the context in which they get played out” (93). Because we cannot start with conceptual schemes, we must start where we find ourselves: in the world with others. While we may have “prior theories,” there is no theory that can necessarily account in advance for what is about to happen. For this reason, we must take a stance of open- ness concerning our interlocutor. This involves adopting a principle of

bodily limits Karen Barad develops in her philosophical elaboration of an agential realism. Barad explains convincingly that in looking at the outer limits of “­human beings” on the one hand and of “apparatuses” (or media devices) on the other, visual clues can be quite misleading. Instead, she as- serts, “­human bodies, like all other bodies, are not entities with inherent bound­aries and properties but phenomena that acquire specific bound­aries and properties through the open-­ended dynamics of intra-­activity.”25 Es- pecially ­because it is made not by a biologist but a physicist, this assertion does, I think, confirm my approach of looking at the genesis of bodily and technical surfaces from the inside. The specific form this book has fi­nally taken is that of a fictitious exhibi- tion. This is not to say that from this point forward, pre­sen­ta­tion ­will re- place explanation, indication supplant argumentation. Rather, the fiction

815). Relata constantly change as an effect of their entanglements. It is the very intra-action where the object, the observer, and the tool for observation all af- fect each other that brings about observable effects and developments. Re- search can move beyond constructionist silence on the effects of materiality by offering what Barad calls an “agential cut” (2003, 815) that accounts for this intra-action. While Barad criticises constructionism, including Foucault and Butler, for having assumed matter’s passivity, it does not prevent her from rehabilitating Butler’s most important concepts of performativity, agency, and subversion by reading them in what she calls a diffractive way. She agrees with Haraway to look for diffraction patterns in empirical analyses that illuminate “the indefi- nite nature of boundaries – displaying shadows in ‘light’ regions and bright spots in ‘da…

Introduction 5 subject has been too self-absorbed and thus oblivious to the ways humans are, in fact, embedded within material contexts from which they neither can nor should entirely distinguish themselves. In like manner, posthumanist Karen Barad, another crucial figure in close relation to the new materialisms, has, against a background in theoretical physics, advanced a theory of “agential realism,” according to which “questions of ethics and of justice are always already threaded through the very fabric of the world.”38 As a consequence, she argues, for example,39 that human ethics must be founded on the inhuman, subatomic reality characterized by infinite potentiality, as quantum physics allows for the emergence of pairs of particles and antiparticles out of empty space. This might look like a simple category-mistake, but when we recall that there is no principal ontological difference between the subjective and

And furthermore it provides an understanding of how discursive practices matter,’ and p. 140: ‘In my further elaboration of this agential ontology, I argue that phenomena are not the mere result of laboratory exercises engineered by human subjects; rather, phenomena are differential patterns of mattering (“diffraction patterns”) produced through complex agential intra-actions of multiple material-discursive practices or apparatuses of bodily production, where apparatuses are not mere observing ins…

﻿Introduction﻿ 15 form itself, the actor may be machine or nonmachine, human or nonhuman, thereby inclusive of such monstrosities. In either case, the actor is an active contributor, or possessor of information, participating in production or mean- ing. As a concept that also refuses reductionism of a single-sided construct, material-semiotics explores how meanings are influenced by material and social elements which create performative weaves, webs, and patterns of meaning. In this weave of materiality and meaning, as Haraway claims, within their interaction, they are interlocked and unable to be separated. The term “intra-action” is defined by Karen Barad (2003, 33) as a concept that “signifies the mutual constitution of entangled agencies.” Through this entanglement, agencies are not independently distinct and only identifiable through their enmeshed relationship. This indi…

This is the key point, which Ramberg: I!Luminating Language ----------------·--------·--·------·--·----·---·--·--·-·---------------------·--·---- 217 might also be put as follows. What radical interpretation shows, if Davidson's account succeeds, is how the general supposition that some- thing is an agent-that is, a creature with knowledge of the world and with goals for its conduct in the world-may be implemented in, or employed to constrain, descriptions of the behavior of that agent in such a way that the inJivUJuating featured of that particular mind and lan- guage are systematically revealed. Now, Davidson's account offers a clear success criterion for the radical interpreter: the production of an axiomatic semantic theory that allows the deduction of the proper theorems. Proper theorems are those that will allow the interpreter …

and object, human and nonhuman are necessarily split from one another. Accordingly, this type of relating offers a materiality without boundaries always about to be cut in different ways: whether it is actuated from an affective materiality or virtual primordial stew or whether space, time, and matter only come into existence with each discursive–material entanglement. Barad’s theories suggest that matter itself only comes into being through intra-actions, what she calls the “cut” of an apparatus’s measurement. Whatever the form of relationality, these writers resist both

accurately reflected because the act of separation and the critical distance required are impossible. Rather, the world is continually articulated by an ongoing performance of difference. While reflection “reflects the themes of mirroring and sameness,” diffraction “is marked by patterns of differ­ ence” (Barad 2007, 71). At the heart of Barad’s agential realism is the principle of quantum entanglement. Quantum physics has altered ideas about space and the way that objects affect each other over distances. Barad takes quantum entan­ glement and extends it into metaphysics. The world and all the objects found in it are intimately entangled to the degree that individual objects are no longer the building blocks of reality. Rather, phenomena, which are materially and discursively produced, count as the ontological foundation of reality. On this account, matter, humans, bugs, bird nests, microscopes, fountain pens, and glass sculptures equally count in the production of

beyond the human. Karen Barad’s ‘agential realism’ borrows from quantum physics to reconceptualise agency as interaction (entities emerge from their interactions rather than pre-existing them) (2007, especially chapter four). The idea that individual agencies emerge through interaction or entanglement recalls the way Merleau-Ponty’s perceiver and perceived are mutually consti- tuted through the intertwining of the ﬂ esh. Many thinkers associated with posthumanism and new materi- alism engage explicitly with Merleau-Ponty, recognising the extent to which their work resonates with a phenomenology of embodi- ment. Astrida Niemans, for instance, proposes a ‘posthuman phe- nomenology’ that extends the experience of embodiment beyond subjectivised humans to other bodies, for instance ‘bodies’ of water (2017: 23–4). Diana Coole argues that, in his late unﬁ nished writ- ings, Merleau-Pon…

Introduction 25 and the model of representation built into propositional attitude psychol­ ogy. Evidence for this lack of fit comes from range of sources, from neu­ ral network modeling to detailed studies of action control and perceptual processing. Second, and correlatively, I explore tools for achieving social understanding and social coordination that bypass the propositional atti­ tudes. These range from direct perception of emotions to game-theoretic heuristics (such as tit-for-tat in the iterated prisoner’s dilemma) and what AI theorists term scripts and frames. This introduction has brought out some of the common themes that run through all the chapters. In contrast, the book ends with an afterword that seeks to identify some of the principal avenues for further inquiry. If there is one unifying theme for this volume, it is that the fully concep­ tual understanding that w…

that too much explanatory weight is placed upon an isolated moment of intentional deliberation, as if such discrete intentional states are not situated within the larger networks of desires, beliefs, and attitudes, of both the individual and society. This objection has been one of the justifications for anti-intentionalist frameworks of literary and cultural understanding: meaning simply cannot be controlled by the intentions of an individual, so we must look elsewhere if we are to understand cultural dynamics. 70 A very different response to the limitations of examining isolated, discrete intentional states is pursued by Livingston and Ponech, drawing on the work of Michael Bratman and Jon Elster. 71 Accepting that 'time-slice' analyses of the isolated actions of human agents are overly abstract and idealized-implausibly positing 'agents who are always starting from scratch in their deliberations'72-they argue that individual actions must be

Barad (2007, x) prefers the term “intra-action” – between human subjectivity and nonhuman materiality. Affectively, contemplating this relationality elicits what Ben- nett first characterizes as “a nameless awareness” (2010, 4) of the agential power of things. However, that awareness takes on more clear-cut affective qualities in the course of Bennett’s discussion: it is a form of ecstatic marvel at the efficacy of the nonhuman world, which is arguably the default affective stance of New Materialism across the board. Other nonhuman-oriented thinkers, however, oppose both that focus on human- nonhuman entanglement and wonder as the main affect structuring philosophical engagements with materiality. For philosophers including the already mentioned Harman (2002; 2018) and Meillassoux (2008), materiality is by definition something that refrains from relation. That is one of the premises of o…

4 Kai Merten that leads to real diffraction of matter on the quantum level. Metaphorical diffraction creates real diffraction, so to say. For Barad, these (partially metaphorical) diffractive onto-epistemological entanglements are not stable “objects” but, apart from being inextricable con- figurations of “subject” and/with “object,” they are momentary situations. To convey both these aspects, entanglement and eventness, Barad has coined the felicitous term “intra-action”: “In fact it is not so much that [entanglements] change from one moment to the next or from one place to another, but that space, time, and matter do not exist prior to the intra-actions that reconstitute entanglements.”8 Intra-actions in turn are created by “agential cuts” within “apparatuses.” Apparatuses enact agential cuts that produce determinate boundaries and prop- erties of “entities” within phenomena, w…

we see ourselves, for example, as consisting of the elements of various rela- tionships rather than as discrete individuals, or as collective enunciations or expressions of environments, then our actions—our expressions of agency— become not so much instances of our own picking and choosing, but rather examples of our propensity to act and react in accordance with both our inherent capacities to act and be acted upon and our environment’s capac- ity to act and, more importantly, to act upon us. Existence, when conceived as an expression of extended agential capac- ities, becomes an ongoing unfolding of interdependent relationships where the actions of one entity depend on the ability of another entity to be acted upon, and where the capacities of one entity are enabled by the capacities of another. That is, no act is possible without there first being a relation- ship from which the act…

Entangled Fidelities: Reassembling the Human 65 require further exploration and explanation. We need always to step at least one stage further back in the process of assembling in order to identify through the relations that occur, how some ‘actors’ are having an effect upon others. It is this that Latour is attempting to articulate when he writes about Actor Network Theory (ANT): We don’t know yet how all these actors are connected, but we can state as the new default position before the study starts that all the actors we are going to deploy might be associated in such a way that they make others do things. This is not done by transporting a force that would remain the same throughout as some sort of faithful intermediary, but by generating transformations manifested by the many unexpected events triggered in the other mediators that follow them along the line. This is what I dubbed ‘the principle of irreduction’, and such is

Beyond Oua/ism 41 Moreover, if the same tenn, for example, 'thinking', has different uses in different contexts, then it also has different meanings and we must be careful not to conflate these or otherwise become confused by them. While he challenges dualism then, and posits a dearly embodied con· ception of the human agent, Ryle does not directly seek to locate 'mental phenomena' in the body or even in action. He is more concerned with the manner in which mental concepts are used by embodied agents in spedfic contexts of actions: that is, with their occasions of use and their social and phenomenological contexts. Notwithstanding this, what emerges oul of this analysis, in my view, is an embryonic conception of the embodied actor and I will be attempting to draw this conception into the foreground in my exposition. There is much here that requires unpacking. I will begin b…

resembles the second, although it has one important advantage: it bridges the gap between the explanation of action and the justifi ca- tion by implicitly accepting the role of causality in intentional action as a formal requirement of explanation. The idea is that an action to be fully explained as an instance of ‘human’ or ‘full-blooded action’ must not just be explicable, but also intelligible and the requirement of intelligibility is the commitment on the part of the agent to a for- mal principle of rational recognition (and not coherence to some supposed given purpose). My action expresses something about me; it communicates my intention to an ideal other who, to use an apt metaphor, is able to ‘read’ my inner self from my outer expressions (Ricoeur, 1981). The hermeneutical theory is grounded in the assumption that an act-event is comparable to a language-event in that it is the substantia- tion of the particularity of a subject through a universal medium of

It seems likely that a similarly deflationary approach will prove profitable for understanding the sense of agency. Chapter 9 provides support for that thesis, particularly in the suggestion that agency provides a common thread between our sense of ownership for our own bodies and body parts (what I called φ-ownership) and our sense of ownership for our thoughts (ψ-ownership). Turning from our awareness of our own agency to analyzing what that agency consists in, chapter 10 explores the relation between intentional action and commonsense psychology. It points to a range of phenomena suggesting, first, that there are ways of thinking about the springs of inten­ tional action that do not involve the propositional attitudes, and, second, that we can navigate the social world and coordinate with other agents without engaging the explanatory framework of commonsense psychol­ ogy.

In this first part I introduce my terminology and methodology. I will defend the possibility of devising a new form of meta- physical realism that results from the intersection of ontology and epistemol­ogy. I introduce my precise understanding of realism and of experience in order to distinguish this investiga- tion from other attempts to formulate a realistic position based on ex­perience. In doing so I begin to spell out the correlation between phenomenology and process ontology as an adequate starting point to investigate the concrete, physical reality we are living in, and thus as an adequate method for developing a dynamic realism.

entities are interrelated by operations of perception­ – ­each one perceives others by being affected by them from outside and not, as in Leibniz, by having them inside as a programme for action. In Whitehead, actual entities in their mutual solidarity are respon­ sible for anything concrete through their goals, their creativity and their capacity for satisfaction.24 As in Tarde, and by contrast with indexicalist interiorities, Whitehead’s actual entities are aim- oriented, and whatever is exterior to them affects them only by affecting the aggregate course of action. Latour introduces the idea of a post-established harmony between non-substantial monads that struggle to survive in different tests of resistance. These tests are crucial, and one can only count how many units of action there are in relation to these tests of resistance.25 He draws on Tarde to propose a monadolog…

correlated with the need to join in and the satisfaction from participating in the rituals integral to society (sports, politics, music etc.) and religion. There is also evidence that seeing other people’s emotions activates the same areas as our own. Our theory of mind (i.e., of other people’s mental life-- intuitive psychology) seems not to be one inference engine, but the sum of many and, as more research is done, more modules will be discovered. Another critical feature of inference engines is that they often run in decoupled or imaginary mode while we consider the past or the future. This starts quite early as shown by the common presence of imaginary playmates in children, their ability to grasp stories and TV, and he notes that research seems to show that children who create playmates seem to be better at grasping other people’s mental states and emotions.

Specificity Barad (2007: 74) notes that ‘entanglements are highly specific configura- tions’, and so the specifics of my entanglement with Etyme certainly shape the how empathy is experienced in the game. For example, the humanoid avatar could be argued to facilitate such subjectivities in a more anthropo- centric way, as we may “identify” with the avatar as a character involved in a particular situation (see Martin 2013, also Riek et al. 2009, for a similar ar- gument about anthropomorphic robots).

The approach Floridi and Sanders develop is so interesting because they give an account of artiﬁcial moral agency in which moral agents do not nec- essarily possess free will or moral responsibility. This way, they take away the obvious objection that technologies, lacking consciousness, can never be moral agents as human beings are. It is crucial to Floridi and Sanders’s analy- sis that they explicitly choose an adequate “level of abstraction” at which it becomes possible and meaningful to attribute morality to artiﬁcial agents— such an abstraction is needed in order to avoid the obvious objection that artifacts cannot have agency as humans do. As criteria for agenthood, there- fore, Floridi and Sanders use “interactivity (response to stimulus by change of state), autonomy (ability to change state without stimulus) and adaptabil- ity (ability to change the ‘transition rules’ by which state is changed).” This

In what he calls “inverse archaeology,” he argues for locating feelings where they appear, on the surface, in the sensory capacities and electrodermal properties of the skin. Barad and Tomkins, like game studies, also share a problem with “representationalism” and want to locate meaning in the mat- ter at hand, not in signification. I use Barad’s notion of entanglement and Tomkins’s attention to surface in order to argue for a more everyday kind of entanglement, where representation is a form of matter that matters. The same year that Ivan Sutherland first demonstrated Sketchpad, Tomkins and other psychologists met in Princeton to discuss how the af- fects might fit into computer simulations of human intelligence. The aim of the conference, sponsored by the Educational Testing Service, was for psychologists to discuss the potential for computers to expand research into the field of personality. In his presentation at the conference, Tom-

illusory. To counter this illusion, she argues, we must go deep into the subatomic structure of matter to find a new model for empathy based on the fundamental entanglement of matter. In many ways, Barad’s model is the opposite of Sedgwick’s queer reading of Tomkins. Sedgwick, quite famously, argued for a queer theoretical practice that resists hidden/ revealed binaries, or what she called “paranoid reading.” She took this les- son in part from Tomkins’s insistence that the emotions of the face are not signifying the processes of some deeper system to be read on the surface of the body as expressions of that deeper system; rather, they are located, in a very real sense, in the matter of the body’s surface. As many do, I find Barad’s notion of a “hidden realm” of entanglement that might inform a new ethics very compelling. The modest question I pose, however, is this: Do we have…

The aim of this chapter is to demonstrate that action is best comprehended as a narrative discourse of ethics, rather than an expansion of the realm of physics. 4.2 Three Rival Models of the Explanation of Action Let us fi rst begin with a quick summary of the standard explanatory models of action in play. The word ‘rival’ above should be treated suspiciously because each theory of action has as its goal a very different aim and, if one ignores the aim, then the theories do seem to be competing to explain the same phenomenon. However, it is pertinent once again to put on the table a hypothesis which is central

II of this book examines a (small) portion of Newtonian physics. The point of this application is threefold: ﬁrst, to see in a real but relatively straightforward case how my approach sorts out what exists from what doesn’t; second, to see how ontological evaluation can yield principled results even in a context that far outstrips the commonsense arena that our ontological promptings were ﬁrst honed in; and third, to see how powerful methodological prejudices about explanation can conspire with routine generalizing practices in mathematics to produce (when that mathe- matics is applied) strong (and yet unjustiﬁed) ontological intuitions. I single out the substantivalist/relationist debate about space and space-time as an excellent illustration of this last phenomenon. I’ll show how the appli- cation of geometries to motion that yields simple and uniﬁed laws leads to intuitions about the …

Entangled Fidelities: Reassembling the Human 57 is determined in advance or open to reliable prediction, but it does show that if our behaviour is to change then appeals to the purely rational dimension of ourselves are going to be more limited than we care to recognize.6 I will now support this with reference to more overtly philosophical sources. In analysing how decisions come to be made and positions adopted, one factor that needs to be taken into account is how much most of us take on trust. In part this is a matter of necessity in that the details of many matters of concern or issues are so complex and potentially overwhelming that we are more inclined to address them by asking first whose interpretations are to be trusted than by examining the details ourselves. This makes good sense as there is often neither the time nor the capacity to enter into such issues at the required depth. Environmental concerns

ment to thrive. Entanglement is persuasive today partly because it does an end run around linear causality. Since quantum physics, we know that the act of measuring reduces probabilities to a single discrete measure. Entanglement solves this problem by opening up causality to the relation of observed event A to observed event B, thus replacing linear tempo- ral priority with relationality and a web of probable events.23 In this way, correlation within an ever-expanding web can begin to insinuate causality. With regard to consciousness, the environment has become an affordance for cognition and consciousness, which means that the environment now has a key role to play in the cognitive system that straddles mind and world. Perhaps because so many Romantic writers wanted to change the world, they resisted the necessity of an embodied mind tethered to the world. So too does ecolog…

than (or in addition to) neural structures makes it possible to characterize the phenomenology in much more precise terms than is possible in other approaches, and it allows us to state clearly the issues involved in the rela- tions among language, thought, and awareness. Chapter 4 was something of a surprise to me. Since topics such as intention, obligation, and social norms, to be studied in the rest of the book, are conditions not on beliefs but on actions, I felt it would be im- portant to understand something about the structure of action. My explo- rations led to simpler and simpler actions, while still revealing surprising complexity—much of which had been established previously, especially by researchers in robotics. What is novel here is the discovery of signiﬁ- cant parallels between the capacity for complex action and the capacity for language production. One outcome is a new take on what is special and what is not special about the language capacity, a hot topic in

us. Here the paradox is that the currently fashionable antihumanism of social and literary systems without agents runs counter to the participatory epistemology of contemporary physics, which has abandoned the clock- work world of its early modern paradigm (O’Neill, 1995). Modern physics has restored the fundamental effects of embodied perception in its theory of knowledge.The complicity between the embodied knower and the objects of scientific knowledge requires that anthropomorphism be regarded as a constitutive feature of modern knowledge rather than as an idol of human ignorance. Among those who have realized the implications of modern quantum physics, there is an urgent appeal for the renewal of holistic thinking (Berman, 1981). Of course, this means flying in the face of all the liberal- warnings about the errors and monstrosities of totalitarianism. But the real issue is one of wh…

However, if such statements were to serve their intended purpose of supplying the ‘primitive’ descriptions that could publicly verify the particular and law-like statements of science, on pain of a dead-ended solipsism, they could not be phrased in a subject’s private language, but only in a public language the meanings of whose terms could be intersubjectively communicated and understood by practitioners within a scientific community. As outlined above, the protocols of verification were to be expressed in a physicalist language locating and describing objects by publicly accessible spatio- temporal predicates. None of the foremost positivists wished to challenge the publicity requirement on the meaning of practicable protocols, but the requirement provided an initial indication that the manner in which all meaningful …

I find it surprising that the authors did not mention Ratto’s collaboration with a NGO and a Ugandan hospital to develop 3D-printed prosthetic limbs. This impressive project vividly exemplifies the entanglement of flesh, data, and other matter that characterize Barad’s notion of “the ontological inseparability of intra-acting agencies” (Barad, 2003: 206). To be fair, Ratto et al.’s project involved the printing of lower limbs, and not hands (for this, see the Victoria Hand Project), so the connection between prosthesis and handwork may not have been obvious. More to the point, since Ratto’s version of critical making prioritizes “processual acts” over evocative objects, it is understandable that he would not want to view the prostheses made in his lab as objects-to-think- with (2017: 153). In fact, viewing them in this way might diminish their status as humanitarian assistive d…

broader and dominant tendency of the humanities has been to focus on content, excluding the material. I have sought an ontological framework capable of integrating these diverse tendencies. However, second, such an integration requires an avoidance of reductivism. To the same degree that natural entities ought not be reduced to cultural constructions, social, semiotic, and cultural entities ought not be reduced to natural entities. This requires us to shift from thinking in terms of reduction or grounding one entity in another, to thinking in terms of entanglements. Entanglements allow us to maintain the irreducibility, heterogeneity, and autonomy of various types of entities while investigating how they influence one another. Finally, third, I have above all sought to write a book that is both accessible to a wide audience and that can be put to work by others in a wide variet…

of our minds. To express this a bit more technically, every object has an actual existence, possessing properties that endure through time, and an associated possibility space. The “points” in that space, representing ordinary possibili­ ties, are not mind-independent, but the structure of the space (given by the singular or remarkable possibilities) does exist independently of our minds. By committing ourselves onto­ logically only to the structure (not the rest of the space), we limit the number of trivial possibilities.

One of our most common experiences is that we interact with beings who have conceptual schemes and perceptual apparatuses diﬀ erent from our own (or that do not have such things at all), such as dogs, cats, ﬂ ies and so forth. Well, if interaction depended on conceptual schemes and knowledge, it would be somehow miraculous. Unless we wish to resort to the hypothesis of a miracle or a pre- established harmony, we are forced to admit that interaction is made possible by the sharing of a common and homogeneous space, and of objects independent of our conceptual schemes. Th e fact that negativity turns into positivity and resistance into possibility is thus not a conceptual alchemy but a piece of evidence that comes to us precisely from interaction. 20 In short, the point is not to know what it feels like to be a bat, but rather to note the fact that humans and bats unquestionably

It all happens independently of me.80 Because motor-intentional activity is called forth by the situation in this way, and is therefore to some degree independent of the autonomous will of the subject, it does not have at its heart the kind of autonomous representational content that a subject could have an attitude toward. This account of motor intentionality gives us the tools that we need to understand Merleau-Ponty’s notion of the “positive indeterminate” in experience.

Instead, I pursue an ‘operational’ approach to QM by trying to specify, in informational terms, what happens with quantum mechanical entangle- ment in working technologies deployed for encryption and computational purposes. The idea is to suspend details of theoretical physics and, by describing what QM actually does, reveal implications for our description and conception of being, space and time.27 To do this let us first imagine Alice and Bob playing a game that does not involve QM. They are sequestered far from each other, incommuni- cado; each randomly pushes either the left or right button of a machine that then displays either a 0 or 1; each then writes down the number 0 or 1. After each trial, their results are compared and scored as follows: if they both pressed the right button, and wrote down different numbers, they win; or, if either pressed the left button, and wrote…

and messages which, on arrival, may enable new extensions to be generated, and new connections to be made. Needless to say, the strands are multiply entangled. Further, they have differing strengths, differing adhesiveness, different ductilities. Some entanglements (see Callon, 1998a, 1998b) are tighter than others, some are more likely to snap than others. In all this connectedness, MM-as-a-discrete- entity, nevertheless, can still be regarded as lurking, somewhere in the interior of our distended tennis ball. So let us reduce this to a zero point – let us see only strands that cross over, are knotted at a point which is, as this metaphor hints, both a singularity and more than a singularity, more than one and less than many. Now MM also moves, and that movement is intimately related to time. Even social scientists must nowadays think in terms of space–time or time–space (e.g. Thrift, 1996; Adam, 1990).

of allowing human artefacts to be counted as mind-independent because all that they require is that at one point in time minds existed, which were the architects of the object. Nevertheless, minds do not need to continual- ly exist for those same artefacts to persist. However, this modal analysis of mind-independence still rules out being a realist about minds and mental states because trivially minds cannot exist in some possible world where there are no minds! At most, the modal analysis of mind-indepen- dence can serve as a sufficient condition for realism but not a necessary one. A satisfactory account of the condition of mind-independence thus needs to be weaker than the modal analysis in order to allow for the possibility about being a realist about minds. A realist about mental states or conscious experiences is one who holds that our world is a world containing creatures who are sometimes in states of believing, desiring, remembering, perceiving, etc. and that the

The popularity of the term ‘affordance’ alone indexes the seepage of entanglement. Perhaps no other word better captures the changes in what we think we know about consciousness over the past five decades than ‘entanglement.’ Where perception was once divorced from action, many argue that the sensory–motor system engages in perception for the sake of action.

It is the network’s ability to offer metonymy in the form of particular processes that stand in for the whole without looking like metonymy that makes entangled networks so seductive. Within a network, process, system, function, assembly, and emergence conspire to allow particular instantiations to slide into the rule or law, even as any notion of the outside becomes increasingly untenable.

This ontological fact of memory (distinguished from the particular contents of any specific one) Bergson calls ‘pure recollec- tion’ or ‘virtuality’. The non- synchronous quality of pure recollection establishes an element of indeterminacy in the relation between percep- tion and its object. This delay allows us to escape the immediacy of the present and to open up various different responses to, and encounters with, the world. 9 Bergson’s guiding thought here is that any given thing that interests us is always capable of more determinations than we can make use of at any point. In automatic or habitual recognition, our perception grasps the object and at the same time links it with others in the execution

as each merely formed part of the distant operator who conveyed to it his intelligent orders; but this art is only in the beginning. I purpose to show that, however impossible it may now seem, an automaton may be contrived which will have its “own mind,” and by this I mean that it will be able, independent of any operator, left entirely to itself, to perform, in response to external influences affecting its sensitive organs, a great variety of acts and operations as if it had intelligence.59 Tesla is confident that this can be achieved, because he models the machine on himself: “I am an automaton endowed with power of movement” (184). Cognition, he argues, can be realized in multiple media; substance is not important: “Whether the automaton be of flesh and bone, or of wood and steel, it mattered little” (185). Such speculations, if largely hypothetical and at the time still cl…

of these persons. By measuring the distance between instructions addressed to no one in particular and yourself, you have been made painfully aware of what Don Norman has called ‘the gap of execu- tion’.270 It would be foolish to ignore that which gave the impression that face-to-face interactions were so ‘concrete’ and on such a ‘real life’ scale, and which gave the feeling that it was individuals who were carrying out the action. Such a feeling, of course, was immediately lost when sociologists of the social substituted this healthy intuition with the hidden action of some invisible structure—at which point, nobody in particular was doing any action any more! It was also lost when interactionists retrieved a purposeful and personalized actor but without dissolving the frame ‘in which’ members were supposed to deploy their intelli- gence. A human agent is making sense of a world of objects which are by themselves devoid of any meaning. At which point we are back to

contribute to one another, inscribe themselves into each other. They are always already referring to each other, and, since they are inseparably interrelated, they form just one single reality that one could conceive of as “intra-active,” as Karen Barad does it for physical reality (Barad 2003: 83-93). Cinema, writes Pasolini, is the written language of the reality of action, but this reality of action, on its turn, is always already cinema. It is very intriguing that this idea of the world, even before and without cinema, having always already been cinema, comes explicitly, and precisely in these very words, back in film philosophy with Gilles Deleuze’s two volumes on the topic (Deleuze 1985,1989). But Pasolinis approach is relevant far beyond the realm of cinema. Read in the light of Karen Barad’s ideas about “Agential Realism,” we can see the close parallel between Barad’s and Pasolini’s critique of semiology, and of

crucial. On the ontological level, Molnar agrees with Hume and Lewis that there is nothing besides local matters of fact. Harman might well object that this implies an “undermining” of objects by reducing them to their subatomic constituents (2011a, 8–10); nonetheless, such a position is at least not incompatible with Harman’s claim that objects have a substantial reality outside of, and anterior to, their relations. Molnar would also not disagree with Harman’s argument that an object’s properties are always fully actual and intrinsic (rather than potential or virtual), even when they are not currently being enacted (Harman 2009b, 130). For Molnar, however, this intrinsic reality is itself largely composed of actual causal abilities to do things: to perform directed actions and thereby to interact relationally with other things. Because the properties of individual things are powers, they make possible a substantial sort

Bergson’s early project is to free the unadulterated flow of time from these artificial divisions of the mechanical world. He wants to liberate the continuum from the mathematical abstraction that divides it into a series of points. His method is to show that this medium in which part and whole are mutually transformed is not only distinct from the discrete multiplicity, but is its condition of possibility. Bergson thus presents us with two fundamentally different media for organizing the multiple nature of the given: a discrete multiplicity is defined by juxtaposition and space; a continuous multiplicity is defined by interpenetration and time. The first produces homogeneous quan- tities, the second heterogeneous qualities. One gives us a mechanical aggregate of separate events, the other a dynamic, organic whole. The first he considers an external property of language and social life, the second an internal experience of the ego. One is a series of points, the

association in fact consists in integrating the new element into a previous pattern of activity. Whether this previous pattern is in the nature of a reflex, as in the conditioned reflex or on even higher planes, it remains merely an assimilation, of such a kind that the bond of association is never just the simple facsimile of a ready-made relationship in external reality. (Psychologie de l’intelligence) With these “ready-made” data existing here as the represented action, it is easy to see how movement, the stimuli-response bond generated by this action, inevitably becomes the carbon copy of the given relationship in the case that it is dealing with identification through simple imitation or mimicry. The organizing assimilation occurring in the association of perception and movement (whether real or imaginary) is fundamental to the process of projection- identification, upon whi…

would be nothing to discover in the closed systems produced in the experimental setting. Consequently, not only are intransitive objects the premise of experimental activity, but the generative mechanisms discovered in experimental activity are also treated as operative in open systems once they are discovered, despite the fact that they operate in open systems in a fashion where the events they are capable of producing go unrealized because the mechanism is either dormant or countervailed by other generative mechanisms. Bhaskar thus argues that claims about generative mechanisms are transfactual. Experimental activity does not show that constant conjunctions of events must always be operative in open systems, but rather that where these generative mechanisms exist without producing actualities or events, they are nonetheless operative in these open systems. Bhaskar thus argu…

In distinction from the passivity of matter, modern philosophy has variously portrayed humans as rational, self-aware, free, and self-moving agents. Such subjects are not only deemed capable of making sense ofnature by measuring and classifying it from a distance but are also aided in such a quest by theories whose application enables them to manipulate and reconfigure matter on an unprecedented scale.

is an alternative realization in a different (moment in) time. Logically, there- fore, agential cuts produce entanglements but are not entangled/entangleable with each other. This suggests that “agential cut” could be seen as a comple- ment or alternative to the concept of entanglement, in that it stands for the diverse, even mutually exclusive moments of entanglement produced in different situations. Even if Barad nowhere states this explicitly, the idea of mutually exclusive agential cuts allows for a radicalization and widening of the notion of diffraction and the—quite impossible, but therefore radical and attractive—idea of diffraction as the encounter of the contrary, the mutually exclusive, the temporarily different. This frictional, paradoxical (notion of) diffraction is suggested in Stacey Moran’s, Nathan Frank’s, and Agnieszka Kotwasińska’s contribution to this volume …

from the ontological, even within the effort of a broad existential analogy like Rushdie’s for the illusory underlay of the real. For him, the “dancing grain” of light and shadow on screen, rather than the entrainment of its flickering single frames on the strip, exposes illusion’s false bottom. This difference locates those interwoven scales of image distribution—­the mo- saic luster of the single speckled frame, the mosaic clustering of one frame after another in their rolling (even when no longer spooling) aggregate—­ that cross between platforms and substrates at various pressure points of optic resolution and coherence in the history of motorized screen motion. With this chapter’s subtitle in mind again, there is, theorizations aside, no getting past the apparatus. Nor, when registered, does it speak only for itself. This is the engrained double valence of apparatus reading. One can not only read it, the machinic source, but read with it. One enters, thereby,

an automaton, the elements that the fact-builder wants to spread in time and space is not a black box. It does not act as one’ (SA 131). This provisional, functional unity in relation to a given context is what makes a fact substantial. Given this packaged functionality, “facts now have a vis in- ertia of their own. They seem to move even without people. More fantastic, it seems they would have existed even with- out people at all” (SA 133). Por Latour, the metaphysical work traditionally assigned to substances is now handled by the operational inertia proper to black boxes. On this platform, the term “sub- stance’ names the solid, packaged resistance that is essential to an object’s status as an agent. As the double-bind of resis- tant availability, grace manifests as the enabling strength of an object’s simultaneous movements of making-available and packing-away. The frequent obscurity of grace results, in part, simply from the fact that, in each and every object,

murdered by Ingram Fizer” (assuming Fizer was really the guilty party)? As explained earlier, my way of handling this situation would not be to talk about pre-existing capacities in the components (Marlowe, Fizer, knife), but about actual properties of the murder as a higher-order object. DeLanda: Yes, I totally agree that this is a problem. I pres­ ently do not know how to solve it, but I agree that if I do not find a principled way of limiting the number of possibili­ ties associated with capacities, then there is a big hole in my ontology.

names’ (PF 160). The representation is imperfect, but functional. Even when an agent has successfully wrangled a sufh- cient subset of the multitude into alignment, this success will have forced the agent to undergo a trial that continues to inform and deform its own composition. Empowered to act by a sufficiently queued multitude, the multitude’s swarming complexity will still animate its representative agent in surprising ways. Even in cases where the agent is conscious, its “action is not done under the full control of consciousness; action should rather be felt as a node, a knot, and a conglomeration of many surprising sets of agencies” (RS 44). In this sense, the line between the conscious and the non-conscious, between the purposeful and the pur- poseless, between the intentional and the non-intentional, is blurred. The human and the nonhuman bleed into each other as human intentions are animated by powerfully pur-
