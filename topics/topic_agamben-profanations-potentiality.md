and conditions it, but also seems to remain essentially subordinate to it” (HS, 44), and that “it is never clear, to a reader freed from the prejudices of tradition, whether Book Theta of the Metaphysics in fact gives primacy to actuality or to potentiality” (HS, 47). There is, then, for Agamben, a “constitutive ambiguity [in] the Aristotelian theory of dunamis/energeia” (HS, 47), which has remained unresolved. This issue is largely addressed in Agamben’s analysis of the necessary co-belonging of potentiality and “impotentiality” (adunamia) and of the precise way in which potentiality passes over into act (see potentiality/impotentiality), but Agamben’s argument concerning the primacy of pure potentiality over actuality (and of the human as a “being of pure potentiality” (2007b: 2)) can also be understood by returning to the original Greek word energeia. In the essay, “The Work of Man”, Agamben notes that the term

say they are identical). This can help absolve Agamben from the repeated charges of extreme political pessimism that have marked his work. First of all, it is worth recognising that Agamben does not consider himself to be pessimistic at all, saying in an interview that ‘I don’t see myself as pessimistic ... I am sure you are more pessimistic than I am.’43 We may wonder if this statement was made in good faith, coming as it does from a philosopher who gained international notoriety with his assertion that the camp is the nomos of the modern.44 Here it is worth comparing Agamben to Adorno, who presents an apparently similar set of claims regarding the historical trajectory of modernity, and the potential for absolute domi­ nation that it contains (a potential unleashed in the twentieth-century totalitarian states). Adorno is infamous for his political pessimism, which reaches an almost lyrical height in his late book Minima Moralia. To pick out a striking passage:

Chapter 3, in many ways, extends this trajectory of thought into a dia- logue with the work of the Italian theorist Giorgio Agamben. Despite the growing popularity that Agamben’s work is currently experiencing, there is little critical material available that would seek to unite his earlier, more literary work with his later philosophical, po liti cal, and theological rumi- nations, such as those centered on the fi gure of the homo sacer, the West- ern legacy of the messianic, the called- for forces of profanation or his development of an ontology of pure potentiality. Lacking this connection, I believe an opportunity is missed, not only to illuminate the overall unity of Agamben’s thought, but also to more fully develop a radical conception of poetics today in relation to the philosophical, as well as the theological. Beginning with his characterization of a scission within language that pos- its philosophy as that which can know its object without possessing it and

64 ■ On Language and Its Profanation of language.”66 It is for this reason, I would further speculate, that theol- ogy has become almost the central focus of Agamben’s work over recent years.67 Th eology discloses an inadvertent truth about the origin of lan- guage that is yet entirely material, and it is this truth which Agamben has become particularly attuned to, that which he seeks to disclose as an en- tirely profane revelation— and which, again, shares a good deal in Lacoue- Labarthe’s reading of Celan’s poetry. In what is still the most comprehensive assessment of Agamben’s work to date, Leland de la Durantaye has charted the progression of Agamben’s poetics as it merges with his general comments on the destruction of ex- perience in the modern era (and the accompanying de- subjectifi cation of the subject) and as it is for Agamben an attempt to isolate the “Idea of Lan- gua…

abstraction, in trying to overcome that confusion. In Griffiths the preju- dice was manifest in his scientism, leading to his eliding of normativity. In Agamben the prejudice stemmed from his post-structuralist founda- tions, and led to him misrepresenting Levi’s shame; for Agamben shame was the awareness of inhumanity’s trace in humanity and, while one is prepared to accept this might sometimes be the case, we are not driven to see it as necessary to understanding humanity, by the logic of potentiality. In structuring the book in this way, my intention was to set up two philosophical positions; the thought is that one’s rejection of one of these might well incline one to recoil to an embracing of the other. However, both contain, on a structural level, similar flaws. As we saw in Chapter 1, scientism is committed to an attempt to determine mean- ing through a theory of natural kinds; here meaning is determined by the

absolutely unrepeatable). The concept form-of-life, then, is designed to disrupt the metaphysical logic of presupposition, in which being as such can only appear as a brute, ‘bare’ presence. Form-of-life thus functions as a tool for bringing the intelligibility of pure being to light, for redeeming the object banished in the inclusive exclusion from the nothingness to which it was consigned. In this sense, form-of-life is an exemplary Agambenian concept, operating as it does in two registers at the same time, functioning to disrupt both the inclusive exclusion of bare life in metaphysical politics and the unthinkability of being as such within metaphysics. Agamben’s wager, and the wager of political ontology, is that these two operations are inseparable (which is not to say they are identical). This can help absolve Agamben from the repeated charges of extreme political pessimism that have marked his work. First of all, it is worth

Agamben’s work what I take to be his most salient, concrete, and even prac- tical point. Within this pro cess, the goal of the author, as paradoxical as it fi rst ap- pears to us, is to avoid creating a fi nished or actualized product, something that Derrida’s work has testifi ed to for quite some time. In this embracing of the potential over the actual, there is no product at all really, only the ongoing pro cesses that never cease articulating and rearticulating themselves. Th is is where true thought is locatable, though never contained, as it pulses and maneuvers under every thing that is said or written. Agamben himself has described this state: “Contrary to the traditional idea of potentiality that is annulled in actuality, here we are confronted with a potentiality that conserves itself and saves itself in actuality. Here potentiality, so to speak, survives actuality and, in this way, gives itself to itself.”2

the diagram is a site for the production of ordered existence, Agamben’s camp is a site of its destruction – hence the frequent criticism of Agamben’s universalisation of the model of camp as rather implausible (see Connolly 2004). Indeed, the constitutive feature of the concentration camp is its manifest non-universality, proven by the manifest presence of an exterior space that is not a zone of absolute annihilation. It is then merely logical that Agamben’s camps are something that one would wish to escape at any cost, provided that any possibility of ﬂight remains, since whatever there is on the outside is by deﬁnition less life-threatening. What makes Agamben’s disconcerting metaphor of the camp as the nomos of modern politics paradoxically and perversely consoling is that it allows us to give overly simple answers to the questions of freedom and resistance. Obviously, freedom lies outside the camp and

88 It is not a coincidence that this distinct perspective and these terms, coher- ing around the incorporeal, evoke the work of Aby Warburg. In the mid-­1970s, Agamben spent a year at the Warburg Institute Library in London, and his way of thinking about potentiality seems explicitly informed by the notion of Nachleben with which Warburg is preoccupied in his Mnemosyne Atlas (1924–1928). As we have already seen in the chap- ter on Ernie Gehr, for Warburg images contain pagan energies preserved as ghosts waiting to be re-awakened at a later time. Thus, for Agamben, repetition—another vital term in his philosophy—comes to mean not a reoccurrence of the same but rather “the possibility of what was.”31 One could perhaps say that in Agamben’s use of the concept, repetition loses its mimetic quality to acquire a creative dimension. This Warburg-inflected philosophy of potentiality has proven fertile outside its own domain and has quite recently spilled over into the field of

chapter. (6.) In Potentialities, Giorgio Agamben states that ‘For Aristotle, all potential to be or to do something is always also potential not to be or not to do’ (Agamben 1999: 215). (7.) Cf. another member of the Frankfurt School, Siegfried Kracauer, and his call for more, not less, rationality in combating the dehumanising aspects of the ornament (Kracauer 1995: 86; cf. Foster 2003: 75–6). (8.) This has also been given a recent formulation by Manuel DeLanda in his Philosophy and Simulation under an investigation of the copresencing of irreducible and decomposable wholes (DeLanda 2011: 185). (9.) In Heideggerian terms, this question is taken up under Gelassenheit, or ‘letting-be’: ‘man, as in-dwelling in releasement to that-which-regions, would abide in the origin of his nature, which in consequence we may paraphrase: man is he who is made use of for the nature of truth. And so, abiding in his origin, man would be drawn to what is noble in his nature. He would have a

to tumble back into the abyss from which it had earlier come—an abyss, as we have seen, Agamben too is familiar with. And sometimes, beauti- fully, the works do fall right back into this abyss, and we should not want to stop them. In fact, we should perhaps hasten their withdrawal into one’s own personal archive of errant thoughts and writings. If they did not do so, then we would have forgotten that “Th e pure potentiality of thought is a potentiality that is capable of not thinking, that is capable of not passing into actuality.”7 Th e impulse to delve into one’s potential, and to work with the infi nitely undefi ned mass of possibilities that are there, has, of course, its practical implications: the “fi nished” product is not only never fi nished— I would go so far as to wager that it has less intrinsic value in and of itself for the person who created it than we might ever suspect. Th at is, it is designed

possibility (and sought to react to). It is rather much closer to the notion of a nomos of exception or of a generalized space of the ban that we introduced earlier in this chapter. Dean suggests that, in wanting to connect Schmitt’s notion of land-appropriation (Landnahme) with the idea of exception (Ausnahme), Agamben goes oﬀtrack. Dean believes: “Agamben ignores the overall elemental framework in which the terrestrial character of the nomos is located.”51 Dean adds that the Agambenian linkage between Landnahme and Ausnahme ends up “enclosing the nomos in ‘the camp’ as to render the struggles over the rest of the planet … scarcely intelligible.”52 The problem with Dean’s reading of Agamben and, by extension, of the notion of a nomos of exception is that it ignores the role and place of virtual territoriality both in Schmitt’s work and in contemporary practices of aban- donment and exce…

relationship with potentiality. According to Agamben, we can understand ethics only through the ques- tion of the potentiality of action and effects demarcated by subjectivity and difference. Any other reading of ethics damns humanity to complete ethical determinism (where ethics emerges through pure inﬁnite obligation or unchanging Kantian maxims) or to utter nihilism (the idea that the complete lack of connection between subjects prevents ethics from being possible). Agamben sees ethics as acting through one’s own potential subjectivity and difference (HS 44). Only when one sees oneself as not stable can an ethical action take place. When Katniss decides to take her sister’s place, she acknowl- edges the sphere of potentiality both subjects reside in. At the moment her sister is chosen, Katniss sees two different possibilities. For her sister, Prim, Katniss sees the potential for at least one more year of life before the next lot-

1986). DeLanda: But let’s return to the question of the ontologi­ cal status of currently non-manifested dispositions. My own approach to this thorny issue is to begin by distinguishing different types of dispositions, some of which are relatively simple, some much more complex, and try to find a princi­ pled way to eliminate trivial possibilities in the simple cases first. If that works, the hope is that we can take some of the insights developed in the simple cases and apply them to the complex ones. The simplest dispositions are what we may call tendencies. We know that water (at sea level) boils at 100 degrees centigrade and that it freezes at 0 degrees. This can be captured by a counterfactual: if we raised the temperature to 100 degrees (or lowered it to 0 degrees), it would boil (or freeze). Or it can be expressed as part of the description of an object: this body of …

of a system. In the eyes of the sovereign, all people are potential homines sacri.93 The fascination that Agamben’s theory of sovereignty exerted doesn’t attest to the fact that today the state of exception threatens to become the norm, as Agamben claims. To the contrary, it points to the fact that we now live in a society governed by an excess of positivity in which a state of exception is no longer possible. We often are fasci- nated by things that are on the brink of disappearing.94 The state of exception is a state of negativity. It is only possible given an intrusion of the other or exterior. The positivization of society totalizes the normative state today by stripping it of all negativity and transcendence. It totalizes the inte- rior, obliterating any exterior. Terror is produced not only by the transcendence of sovereignty but also by immanence. The terror of positiv…

the quote. The sentence which is problematic for Agamben—‘he seems embarrassed’—is simply omitted; an ellipsis takes its place and leads us directly on to a passage from the following page—a jump of 34 lines or3 paragraphs. With Levi, Agamben employs him for as long as his writings super- ficially appear to lend support, rejecting his writings at the point at which Levi’s refusal to rest (stop wrestling with problems and seek secur- ity in theory) leads to disagreement with Agamben’s thesis. In order to give the impression that Antelme’s writing supports his thesis, Agam- ben ignores, and omits from quotation, what is explicitly said in the text. This is important because what is also clear from Antelme’s report- ing of the incident of the student from Bologna is that the predication of embarrassment went hand in hand with a reporting of the flush— i.e. the blushing, the pinkness—on the student’s face as he was selected

pertains to the role accorded to the concept of iterability. If iterability is to serve as a key to and/or theory of meaning, i.e. warrant our determining meaning through etymological investigation of concepts as Agamben’s practice implies, then it must be able to serve alone as something that can convey meaning. It cannot, and it is part of my argument here that

might thank that the proper response is to adopt the reverse of the response taken in the case of the ªrst class of putative counterexamples. This strategy would be to take the equator and impure sets to be concrete objects and try to explain away the mathematical properties as an appearance resulting from a confusion of those properties with certain of their natural properties. We would have to treat the equator as a natural object like the annual rings in a tree or an artiªcial object like the painted lines used to divide the lanes on highways. But, since annual rings are sections of wood having only a roundish form and vague boundaries, and dividing lines are layers of paint having only a somewhat linear form and vague boundaries, neither is deªnite enough for the mathematical properties in question to apply to them. Moreover, no part of the surface of the earth can be identiªed with …

which allow these operations to function that he seeks to draw out. Their overlapping concerns are perhaps most forcefully displayed in his exploration of the nature of the Nazi concentration camps in Remnants of Auschwitz: The Witness and the Archive (1998). Against the Nazi conviction that the camps were ‘unsayable’ because any description of their atrocities by survivors would not be believed, Agamben declares that it is possible to bear witness to the camps, it is possible to ‘speak Auschwitz’. This is because speaking is a human capacity, and occurs in its fullest form when it speaks of those who have the incapacity to speak, of those who have been excluded from the category ‘human’ and have been reduced to ‘bare life’. The idea that language necessarily includes the unsayable is a central concern of Agamben’s philosophy of language. Language, he finds, is structured by presuppositions. In his 1985 essay

ings, perhaps obscurely but often powerfully and irreducibly” (Ong 2004: 12). By tracing the etymology of a term, it is possible to uncover the possibilities of other forms of thought and life, and reactivate the ener- gies of the past in the present. Agamben’s project, however, is not simply to bring to consciousness that which has been repressed in the course of tradition. Relying on the ambivalence of the French term conjurer, which means both to dispel and to evoke, Agamben suggests that a philosophical archaeology must conjure up, or evoke, an absent origin, in order to dispel it. Its orientation towards the past is thus “a matter of conjuring up its

might arise here, but I will confine myself to a negative remark: the concept of “potential” should be avoided wherever possible. To say that an acorn is a potential oak tree is clearly true, but the real question is this: what actual aspect of the acorn allows it to be potentially an oak tree? To talk about an object in terms of potential is really to view it from the outside, in terms of some future relations it might have, and this enables one to dodge the question of what the actuality of unexpressed qualities might be, here and now. One could argue that unexpressed qualities are only potential, that they have no actuality here and now at all, but I tried to argue against this with my reading of the tool-analysis. I am convinced that objects far exceed their interactions with other objects, and the question is both what this excess is, and where it is. In any case, these questions are far from new, since they in large part dominated the philosophy of the Renaissance. Well

ing described by Agamben between sense and sound – as well as, and more fundamentally, the possibility generated by that crossing. After all, the colon indicates nothing on its own but the existence, beyond what has already been stated, of some- thing yet to come, something more. But the constant tension Agamben refers to – between an idealized notion of a poetry seeking to dissolve meaning in pure sonority and a philosophy seeking to dissolve sonority (and every other material aspect of language) into pure mean- ing – cannot be understood literally. Instead, the tension is ﬁgurative (note Agamben’s consistent use of the conditional “it is as if”). Both poetry and philosophy are inextricably bound by, and to, the materials with which they grapple: language, and the perceivable reality it has been developed to represent. Because of this, there is no way of categorically sep- arating the intentions and directions of philosophy or poetry,

value from - his philosophy. So what value can we extract from Agamben on this reading of his work? What political value is there in ontology and metaphysical critique? The obvious danger here is that political ontology will end up qualifying as neither a real politics (because it is not primarily concerned with ontic political matters) nor a valid ontology (because it imports political ‘values’ into what is meant to be disinterested philosophical speculation - think of how strange, even preposterous, the very idea of ‘political ontology’ would sound to contemporary metaphysicians working in the analytic tradition). In relation to the first worry (I will return to the second in the conclusion to this chapter), in which we face the problem of whether extracting Agamben’s claims about bare life from a sociological register will deprive them of whatever critical theoretical relevance and concrete political purchase they may have

including the relational properties of being in a particular position at a particular time and so on. On a more interesting level, a neutron is made up of one up quark and two down quarks and has the property of having no charge. Interests in the ingredients or in the properties of things can lead inquiries into divergent directions. An interest in ingredients seemsor seemed for a long time in the history of scienceto lead to a dead end, both physically and metaphysically. Until very recently, nothing could be said competently about ultimate physical ingredients. Metaphysically, whenever the pitfalls of atomism have been understood, they have discouraged philosophers from making assertions about ultimate constituents. An interest in properties, on the other hand, seems to have been less insecurely founded and to have had much greater utility. In physical terms it provided the justification for endless observation, especially when properties

even put into effect. And this is where most philosophers would invoke a traditional concept that can only be regarded as misleading: potentiality. For as soon as the specter of potential is raised, the key point has been evaded. It will be said that the various new events involving the plutonium, the plastic cup, and the gyroscope tell us nothing new about the actuality of these objects. Instead, these events only make clear that every object has the potential to affect other things in certain ways. On this point the classical and twentieth century theories are in reciprocal agreement. Namely, the classical models invoke potentiality in order to shut relations out of substance, since if a single hammer has the potential to build a church, a weapon, or a coffin, it might seem possible to forgive its accidental entanglements in any of these activities while maintaining its private integri…

and to conceal it and its purgation through the generation of myth. Now, Girard’s scapegoat undoubtedly bears some resemblance to Agamben’s homo sacer with regard to his exclusion from the community. Moreover, while Girard describes the erection of sacred institutions as the result of trying to control mimetic violence, he is by no means saying that they offer an authentic form of life, any more than Agamben is content with the act which he believes founds sovereignty by excluding homo sacer. In this respect alone Agamben and Girard might agree. Nevertheless, there is another subtle difference between them even here. By the very process of bearing the burdens of the community’s violence, the Girardian scapegoat, unlike Agamben’s homo sacer, becomes something unholy and holy; unholy or sacer because it is the target of the pent-up aggression of the community in mimetic crisis, and holy or sanctus because its death or exclusion is associated

of a mould shaping matter. Simondon criticizes the hylemorphic account because rather than being located in the individuation process ‘the principle is thought to be contained either in the matter or the form, because the actual process of individuation is not thought to be capable of furnishing the principle itself, but simply of putting it into effect’ (Simondon, 1992: 299). Again, a principle of individua- tion is asserted prior to the actual process itself and the principle tells us nothing about the actual operation of the individuation process in itself. For Simondon hylemorphism is a technical schema that has been poorly applied by analogy, thereby masking other types of operation. As he makes clear, the technical origin of the scheme does not invalidate it as long as ‘the operation which is the basis for the formation of the concepts used passes and is expressed entirely without alteration in the abstract scheme’ (1995: 28).

24 Vulnerable bodies The virtual distribution of bodies across violent structures of exceptionality is always open to (and perhaps serves as a condition for) the capacity of human life to be placed variably in camp-like situations. I believe that this is how Agamben explains differentials in the exposure of bodies to force and violence. This is also what I take Agamben to mean when he states that “the nexus between state of exception and concentration camp” offers the potentiality to be and not to be, to materialize and not to materialize. 34 For Agamben, the topological relations of possibility for the camp to manifest itself are always realizable, even if they are not always (often, fortunately) realized for all bodies and lives. This is precisely, in Agamben’s perspective, what constitutes the horror of the camp/camp-life. Indeed, what is particularly horrifying about the camp, as revealed through a topological

ages and viewers. For Agamben, the mutuality or reciprocity could be called intellectual and ideological; that is, he ﬁ nds his own commitment repre- sented in Benjamin and Titian and in turn off ers up those representations for us to follow. But that should not obscure the real connection between their accounts, and it should not distract us from the more general way in which biopolitical critique, or at least this instance of it, immerses itself in the aes- thetic of beauty. Is it at all surprising that the very indistinction that Agamben’s images capture is itself, as he puts it, a mark of “specialness,” with special relating to species, which in turn relates to specious or, in its obsolete deﬁ nition, beautiful (58)? And that elsewhere he identiﬁ es these images with “beauty” itself?46 We could remark similarly about a whole range of biopolitical critique from Antonio Negri …

for its velocity and trajectory, and that motion on its antecendent in turn. However, that matter might be considered a candidate ground constitutes a problem for two rea- sons. Firstly, it constitutes a critique of the passivist concept of matter that informs the dualism of matter and force in mechanical materialism, insofar as the idea that mat- ter could thus ground motion depends on conceiving matter as inert in the first place. The second reason, however, maintains that material grounds cannot satisfy the PSR since, if the above concept of matter is rejected in the interests of the ‘living force’ argu- ment with regard to material nature, and of which Leibniz was a proponent, then mo- tion cannot be self-grounding, since it relies on antecendent and coincident motions. Although therefore neither matter nor motion satisfy the PSR, it maintains the necessi- ty of the contingency…

property associated with them. Clearly the problems of hyperintensionality demand more than intensions (objects individuated by necessary coextension) for their solution.20 The above line of argument for ﬁne-grained properties is, however, misguided. For while there are many distinct ﬁne-grained entities associated with each property, those ﬁne-grained entities are not necessarily distinct properties. Consider another domain where something very similar appears to be going on—the domain of numbers. Take the cube root of 729 and the square of 3. It seems that one can be focusing on the former without focusing on the latter, and one can focus on both without focusing on the number 9. Moreover, in some sense one can give a different analysis of the former than of the latter. The proper analysis of the cube root of 729 certainly involves the cube-root function, whereas the proper analysis of the square of 3 does not. But should these facts incline one to say that corresponding to every

fact that the introduction of this velocity would lead to some obscure statements in the mixture theory (see the extensive discussion of this problem in de Boer, 1995 b). It should again be pointed out that, in the global form of the balance principle, the integration process covers the body Bα of the constituent ϕα. Only in this case do the local statements of the balance principles given in this section come out right. If the global forms of the balance principles are referred to the partial solid body ϕS, an additional term connected with the difference velocity between ϕS and ϕα(α ̸= S) must be added. This is also valid for the entropy inequality in the next section.

his work, but for the incisiveness of their interpretation and for their hon­ est engagement with the work's virtues as well as its limitations. We have not set topical restrictions, nor have we avoided including those who are unsympathetic to Agamben's ideas. In doing so we hope that this volume will contribute to the deepening dialogue about Giorgio Agamben's schol­ arship and, more importantly, foster a discussion about the larger issues his work addresses. The editors wish to thank the publishers for permission to reprint the following essays: William E. Connolly, "The Complexities of Sovereignty," in Sover­ eign Lives: Power in Global Politics, edited by Jenny Edkins, Yeronique Pin­ F:n, and Michael J. Shapiro (New York: Routledge, 2004), 23-40.

at the conclusion of his Le Thor seminar, which Agamben attended: “You can see my limit – I can’t” (IP, 59). This dictionary draws on the insights of scholars who have each, in their own ways, made important contribu- tions both to understanding Agamben’s thought, and to developing it in new directions. The limits of this dictionary, we feel, therefore coincide with the limits of Agamben scholarship as it currently exists. It is our hope that putting this dictionary into the world will enable those who can see its limits to transcend them.

The study has since been published in the series Beiruter Texte und Studien. Sobieroj's study was not available to us at the time the main body of this introduction was being written. The few facts about Ibn Khafif for which we have made space here are therefore based in large part on Schimmel's work. Later, however, Sobieroj kindly provided us with a copy of his dissertation, and we were thus able to make use of his work while revising our original draft. 41 Earlier contributions to our knowledge of Ibn Khafif are discussed in some detail by Schimmel in …

reaction between them resulting in a very different set of substances. Here again, one cannot say that acid and shells are real and their conjunction only an accident. The example can be pushed further by imagining that some of the cars contain subatomic particles, and that several underground rooms are able to split these tiny things by channeling powerful beams into their midst, even though no one is watching. For those who feel distracted by such bizarre examples, more prosaic scenarios are possible. We can assume that the entire complex of underground chambers has been shut down, all of them decommissioned and filled with cement. This having been done, the objects riding the wheel have nothing to hope for and nothing to fear when underground. They do nothing but circle, orbiting forever down into the earth and up into the sky. But even here there is a sense in which the objects chang…

bubbling over. Here, the model for a diffuse, localized tran- scendence is fermentation. In an experimental theology, “fermentation” might well be taken as a technical, theologi- cal term of central importance. In addition, transcendence, understood as a kind of fer- mentation, must also be uncoupled from the notion of “pu- rity.” Transcendence still marks difference, distance, and resistance, but because it marks them only locally, rela- tively, and provisionally, it parts ways with purity. If the gods exist in Latour’s pluriverse, they are not pure, uncon- ditioned, or exceptional. They are not free from the neces- sity of translation, negotiation, and compromise. Nor are they free from a need for techniques, instruments, technol- ogies, calculations, and metrologies. The gods too, like every other object, must receive the resistant availability of the proliferating multitude as the gift that it is. Latour has no patience for those who, in the name of

Speaking of some tendencies within medieval philosophy, in 7he Coming Community Agamben says, quite correctly in my view, that the contraction of the common into the singularity of its expression "is not an event accomplished once and for all, but an infinite series of modal oscillations" (CC, 19).

secret, the smaller enigma.”9 In contrast, the erotic is never free of secrecy. Contra Agamben, a face loaded with exhibi­ tion-value to the point of bursting promises no “new collec­ tive use of sexuality.”10 Indeed, exhibition destroys any and all possibilities for erotic communication. A naked face without mystery or expression—reduced simply to being on display—is obscene and pornographic. Capitalism is aggra­ vating the pornographication of society by making every­ thing a commodity and putting it on display. Knowing no other use for sexuality, it profanes eros—into porn. On this score, Agamben’s “profanation” amounts to just so much profanity. This profanation is unfolding as deritualization and desacralization. Today, ritual spaces and actions are disap­ pearing. The world is becoming more naked and more

These natural sensibilities become more tender and sentimental as the century progresses, un­ til some Children of Nature (Godwin's Fleetwood, for instance) refuse to hunt or fish because they cannot stand to harm their animal friends. Their love of natural scenery runs usually to the sublime ­ nature in her wilder or more formidable aspects. In appearance the Child of Nature is handsome, of course, but with none of the effem­

individual has a simple view of the future: a time will come when the sum of pleasures that life has left to offer is outweighed by the sum of pain (one can actually feel the meter ticking, and it ticks al- ways in the same direction). This weighing up of pleasure and pain, which everyone is forced to make sooner or later, leads logically, at a certain age, to suicide. (204) This perspective is common to many of Houellebecq’s characters. Annabelle of Particles commits suicide when she is diagnosed with uterine cancer (231); Bruno’s girlfriend, Annick, jumps off a Parisian rooftop when her ugliness, along with Bruno’s rejection of her, becomes insufferable (128). In the post-religious, materialist universe of Houellebecq’s fiction, the earthbound sufferer is not to expect any heavenly recompense for his or her pains, and thus no relief from them at the thought of a better world …

Pain article due. What a pain. How do I get into these things? Why is my neighbor driving my car and getting it smashed up when I don’t drive it but keep shelling out money to keep it run- ning? I’m the consummate nice guy. I rationalize it by reasoning that Alex does a lot of work around here, and he’s a nice guy too, so it’s the least I could do. It’s probably my way for atoning for the humiliating fact that we always have to turn to Alex for a lot of the simple repair jobs and emergencies that I used to be able to deal with but couldn’t possibly handle now. So my penance is giving up my wheels. It’s just too bad Alex is not as capable as I was. In 15 years I never had a single accident. In a few weeks he’s already gotten the fender smashed by some guy in a pickup truck with no insurance and a phony phone number. Time to sell the damn thing. I don’t drive it anymore anyway. [ 96 ]
