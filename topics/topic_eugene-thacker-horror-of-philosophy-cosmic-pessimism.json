As such, this book endeavors to speak to one of the central questions Eugene Thacker poses in his book In the Dust of this Planet, to see if we are capable to propose “a new darkness mysticism, a mysticism of the unhuman, which is really another way of thinking about a mysticism of the ‘without-us,’ or really, a dark mysti- cism of the world-in-itself” (156). Thacker’s recent work on “the horror of philosophy” is influential on this book in several ways. At the root of his work lies not an expansion of central motifs developed by writers in the horror genre, but rather what they tend to leave out, namely, the unthink- able itself, the direct intersection of horror and philosophy. Thacker’s discourse on the horror of philosophy involves a certain way of thinking through horror by horror. In Thacker’s formulation, supernatural horror offers rea…",

This formulation is evocative of an inquiry into the cosmic nature of human horror and bewilderment that can be inventively applied to Cioran’s views on mysticism, cosmos, and consciousness. “Mysticism revolves around the passion for ecstasy and a horror of the void,” Cioran writes, “One cannot know one without the other. . . . Consciousness dilates beyond the limits of the cosmos” (Tears and Saints 64). This quotation helps us to situate the notion of cosmos within the context of consciousness by recognizing how its inter- change registers a dual dissonance/synthesis between self and world, world and cosmos.

Thacker’s main point remains, however, that reality was not made for us, it has not been designed with a special view to human needs, but simply is what it is irrespective of our cultural projections and scientific models. The emergence of human beings is to be considered as contingent a phenomenon in the deep time history of the cosmos as the emergence of dust, heavy molecules, algae, oxygen and whale song. This conviction that the cosmos is indifferent towards human concerns and that human beings do not, in principle, have good chances for ration- ally mastering the environmental conditions for their potential thriving is also called “cosmic pessimism”, and Thacker understands Lovecraft to be the seminal author of this position (Thacker 2011: 80): “The view of Cosmic Pessimism is a strange mysticism of the world-without-us, a hermeticism of the abyss, a noumen…",

Or as Adorno argues of phi- losophy more generally, “The presentation of philosophy is not an external matter of indifference to it but immanent to its idea.”46 Fortunately for the rhetorically aspiring pessimist, there are a number of aesthetic forms and possibilities that lend themselves to pessimistic per- suasion. Although in the present book we make mention of a few of these, other scholars have already insightfully forayed into this area. Dienstag, for instance, suggests that “aphorisms and pessimism are fitted to one another” and points out that many of the great pessimists have written aphoristically. On his view, the unstructured and fragmented nature of aphorisms reflects a",

In his ground-breaking work In the Dust of this Planet, Eugene Thacker develops the implications of pessimism’s commitment to ontological indifference, contending that it challenges us to think not simply the world that stands in opposition to the human or to human consciousness, ‘the world-for-us’ versus ‘the world-in-itself’, but, far more radically, ‘the world-without-us’, the world as completely unrelated and unrelatable to the human.7 This is, for Thacker, the fundamental insight of ‘cosmic pessi- mism’, and he traces this thinking of the ‘world-without-us’ through black metal, demonology, mysticism, philosophy and horror fiction, showing how this indifference manifests across an array of discourses and fields.8 At stake in this reading is n…",

In exploring the ways in which Cioran deploys the fragment, we will aim to show how pessimism, which, as Eugene Thacker suggests, “is the lowest form of philosophy, frequently disparaged and dismissed, merely the symptom of a bad attitude” (“Cosmic Pessimism” 66), holds a close relation to the notion of “failed mysticism” and that, against its relegation to the margins of philosophy and despite its futility, what the scholarly world actually needs—and secretly, even if unknowingly, begs for—is more pessimism. It is difficult to explain the intense and acerbic nature of his pessi- mism, especially given the complicated character of his personal, politi- cal, and intellectual lives.

Similarly, Eugene Thacker draws directly on Lovecraft to underscore the prospect of horrors beyond human thought and experience, particularly as we think about the unknown and the unknowable (9). One assump- tion behind such readings is that Lovecraft makes more sense in a world that no longer appears to make sense or that is teetering on the brink of collapse. Through his view of humanity as something insignificant when contrasted with a cosmic background, Lovecraft anticipated the kinds of concerns over uncertainty proper to the twenty-first century. Although we are not threatened by physical hyperobjects,1 at least not those in the shape of Lovecraftian monsters, we struggle harder every year to accept that no matter how much we pretend to be in contro…",

For Harman, weird or speculative realism not only makes the universe a more interesting place but object-­oriented ontology’s undermining of human exceptionalism (as developed by Jane Bennett, Ian Bogost, Levi Bryant, Timothy Morton, and others who do not address Lovecraft directly) can serve as the start- ing point for a more humane engagement with the universe we inhabit. Also addressing Lovecraft from a speculative realist perspective is philosopher Eugene Thacker, who proposes in his In the Dust of This Planet (2011) that supernatural horror is a privileged venue for address- ing what he refers to as the “unthinkable world” (2).

Wilder- son, Saidiya Hartman, and Calvin Warren; and what I call the “extinctual nihilism” of Jean- François Lyotard and Ray Brassier. This chapter argues that by bringing Mainländer’s work into dialogue with these contempo- rary pessimisms it might be logically strengthened, historically informed, and more pointedly directed in order to become a practical and effective model of ethical, social, and political normativity.

(As Sid Waterman once put it, “I see the glass half full, but full of poison.”) So, while Schopenhauer himself was a curmudgeon, and while he does state that this is the worst of all possible worlds, his philosophy ultimately moves towards a third type of pessimism, one that he never names but which we have tenuously christened a cosmic pessimism.191 For Schopenhauer, the logical endpoint of pessimism is to question …",

Understood to be “about the limits of the human,” horror is a Gorgonian confrontation with a world that can be seen or witnessed and yet is not for humans or, as Thacker claims, is not made for us. 127 Horror’s “negative philosophy” (Thacker’s turn of phrase 128 ) is an insistent attempt at placing us, humans, face to face with a world that is not just or is no longer for us, a “world-without-us.” 129 The main aim of this “world-without-us” revealed by horror is to unsettle the belief that the world must exist for us, for humans and their bodies (with heads attached), and can only be",

If life is defined by a duplicity ­– the distinction between the living being and life ‘itself’ – then, according to Thacker’s historical survey of the ‘teratological noosphere’, in the undertow of the questioning of life we always find changing conceptualizations of afterlife, whose horrific avatars are so many embodiments (or disembodi­ ments) of this problematic duplicity.

It is time, in other words, that pessimism is redeemed from the margins of the history of Western philosophy, rescued from the periphery of our moral discourse, and placed squarely at the center of our ethical con- siderations as a reflection of a primal ethical truth that is immanent in material existence itself.

This is because, for pessimists, the universe is fundamentally indifferent to human wants or desires. As Thacker puts it, pessimism ‘is the difficult thought of the world as absolutely inhuman, and indifferent to the hopes, desires, and struggles of human individuals and groups’.4 For many pessimists, this indifference is rooted in the human experience of linear time and the contradictory nature of consciousness: humanity’s finite and temporal existence assures that the satisfaction of our desires is, at best, fleeting and, at worst, unat- tainable. Desire drives us to want what we do not have, and, even if we get it, we quickly move on to new desires, a cycle that shows human exist- ence to be a questing after something that ultimately cannot be achieved or maintained. Hence, pessimism assets a basic teleological indifference",

The logic of pessimism moves through three refusals: saying no to the world as it is (or, Schopenhauer’s tears); saying yes to the world as it is (or, Nietzsche’s laughter); and refusing to say either “yes” or “no” (or, Cioran’s sleep). Crying, laughing, sleeping – what other responses are adequate to a world that seems so indifferent? ~ * ~ Cosmic Pessimism. Beyond moral pessimism and metaphysical pessimism this is another kind, a pessimism that is neither subjective nor objective, that is neither about the world-for-us nor about the world-in-itself. A pessimism of the world-without-us. I could call this a cosmic pessimism… but this sounds too majestic, too full of wonder, too much the bitter aftertaste of the Great Beyond. Words falter. As does thought. And so we are left with a weakened pessimism, a pessimism that is first and last about cosmos, a suspicion towards the necessity and possibility of order. This",

Our brief analysis of the horror/terror of mysticism will be more fully ex- plored in coming chapters.

THE MYSTICISM OF HORROR The limit or failure of thought to positively conceive of the divine that is expressed in apophatic mysticism correlates to a similar form of thought- failure exhibited in genre horror.

We are not permitted to remember 1793 and the turmoil of the French Revolution, neither its 1793 hopes nor—what is more to the point for Wordsworth—the subsequent ruin of those hopes. Wordsworth displaces all that into a spiritual economy where disaster is self-consciously transformed into the threat of disaster (\"//\"this/ Be but a vain belief,\" 50-51; my italics), and where that threat, fading into a further range of self-conscious anticipation, suddenly becomes a focus not of fear but of hope. For the mind has triumphed over its times. Thus the poem concludes in what appears to be an immense gain, but what is in reality the deepest and most piteous loss. Between 1793 and 1798 Wordsworth lost the world merely to gain his own immortal soul. The greatness of this great poem lies in the clarity and candor with which it dramatizes not merely this event, but the structure of this event. This part of my argument can be briefly concluded.

Rather than to favor a binary concept of life, Thacker names the strange affinity between the thinking of the world as unthinkable and the living of a life that is unlivable. Thacker thereby curates a concept of the horror of “a life-after-life,” a nouminous life that “elicits a noumenal horror that is the horror of a life that indifferently lives on” (112). Recall- ing this discussion by Thacker, Ligotti’s notion of “beings born undead” comes to mind and is suggestive of a life that indifferently lives on: “We are aberrations—beings born undead, neither one thing or another, or two things at once . . . uncanny things that have nothing to do with the rest of creation, horrors that poison the world by sowing our madness everywhere we go, glutting daylight and darkness with incorporeal ob- scenities” (Conspiracy 222).

For Nietzsche, this development had speciﬁc implications for historio- graphy. After taking note of the steadily declining certainties in post- Copernican ways of knowing, Nietzsche wonders how the radical ques- tioning of overarching knowledge systems speciﬁcally impacts the study of history: does modern historiography perhaps display an attitude more assured of life and ideals?

For readers, this implicit paradox of the worst holds as its negative index the possibility for a sorrow experienced in an ultimately pessimal mode of self-knowledge in which even death itself, in other words, death as an escape from life, is a disappointment. Death’s disappointment is its non-possibility for escape, but due to death’s de-actualization as nothing- ness it necessitates itself as everything.

Rather, the nontherapeutic approach to trauma that she describes suggests a wild utopianism-a hopefulness in despair­ that is reminiscent of the politics of despair Sylvia Townsend Warner describes in Summer Will Show. For her examples, Cvetkovich turns to artists and activists whose work is bound up with the everyday experi­ ence of feeling bad. Cvetkovich is involved with an academic and activist organization, the Public Feelings Project, that has attempted to create a political move­ ment that takes seriously such apparently useless feelings. The Chicago­ based \"feeltank\" associated with the group organizes an annual depres­ sion march. The protesters march in bathrobes and slippers, carrying signs that say, \"Depressed? It might be political,\" and passing out fake prescriptions for Prozac. The point of an event like this is not only that the political landscape is bad but also that it makes you feel bad, and that",

Taking an approach that owes a great deal to Heidegger, Flusser argues that the particles of the electronic environment, the fragments of the world, rather than offering a free ﬂ owing, decentralized space, are radically ﬁ ltered by technical media in such a way that produces images that are projected back on to the world and used to make sense of the world. The notion of an image is important to Flusser not simply as a surface or a representation of an idea. The technical image, a concept that may be Flusser’s major contribution to media philosophy, is instead formulated as an ‘image that means ideas’ ( Jongen 2011 : 208); it is a way of thinking through",

To pessimists, optimists have the illusion that they have mastery over their lives. We keep believing that we have the power to make our lives better, even in the face of all our failures to do so. No tech- nology, morality, or foresight protects us from death and change, and even the shiniest new toy will eventually rust (as Cohle’s name indicates). But the optimist can, in effect, multiply the damage we all will suffer by adding illusions on top of the situation. When these illusions are pierced, it adds the pain of disappointment to the more mundane pains that time inflicts by itself. So, to the pes- simist, optimism is not just blind but, to a point, dangerous. In True Detective, this optimism is embodied in Rust’s p…",
