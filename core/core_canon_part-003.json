The overall picture which emerges for both Greek and Roman material is a matter-of-factness and casualness in illustrating these erotic themes which is very foreign to us. but exactly what we might expect. In view of the different threshold of embarrassment and shame which the ancients would have had. The Greek material displays little sign of emotional involvement among the participants: the pottery is aimed at a particular clientele, and a particular context, where it would be surprising if it did. It is noteworthy that the lack of embarrassment in the Greek",

The obvious avatar of this latest type of totalising control is Foucault’s concept of biopower. It is characterised by the state’s control of subjects through a range of techniques with the ability and power to direct and regulate their actual bodies in space and can be visualised in the architectural model of Bentham’s Panopticon prison of which more is said above in the chapter on Rem Koolhaas’s ‘Junkspace’.

Her texts refashion normative material into alternative situations through sensuous and sensual language, revealing the fluid and diverse pleasures of the body and its parts. Grosz addresses very adroitly the oppositions and contradictions that are, literally, embodied: The body is a most peculiar ‘thing’, for it is never quite reducible to being merely a thing; nor does it ever quite manage to rise above the status of thing. Thus it is both a thing and a nonthing, an object, but an object which somehow contains or coexists with an interiority, an object able to take itself and others as subjects, a unique kind of object not reducible to other objects. Human bodies, indeed all animate bodies, stretch and extend the notion of physicality that dominates the physical sciences, for animate bodies are ob…",

In her view, discussions focusing solely on the politics of representation ﬂ atten and reduce the complexity of culture. From this perspective, understanding the aesthetic forces Wollen describes involves looking at forces outside the cultural, not inside it (Grosz 2005, p. 48). This does not mean denying the importance of social discourses; indeed, this approach is invaluable in exposing the transformation of immanent power into highly stereotypical assumptions. Social construc- tivist (and deconstructionist) accounts expose the binaries Wollen uncov- ers as hierarchical relationships where one side of the binary – generally the white male side – inevitably dominates. Indeed, that is precisely what seems to be playing out in Wollen’s example – where the feminine, Ori-",

Inspired by the French uprisings of 1968, Deleuze and Guattari approached spontaneous mass rebellion as an explosion of desire.30 For them, desire is really desiring—a general, impersonal process that is onto- logical rather than psychological. Individual desires (for fame, fortune, sex, or romance) obviously exist; however, for Deleuze and Guattari, such individual wants and needs are secondary. Although we have desires, we are, first and foremost, of desire. In other words, human beings are an effect of the desiring process.31 This desiring process is a constant, prepersonal assembling-disassembling-and-reassembling of connections and associations. Anything can link up and connect with anything else in the prepersonal realm of desire: this-and-that, blank-and-blank.32 At the same time, however, this fluid process is copresent with stoppages, blockages, and m…",

Now, just after that beginning, she goes on to say: “Only the act of love — the limpid star-­like abstraction of feeling — captures the unknown moment, the instant hard as crystal and vi- brating in the air.”16 I could go on quoting Lispector, but here, I only want to pause on the words “the limpid star-­like abstraction of feeling.” Simulta- neously, one is surprised by the terms here according to which jou- issance (“feeling”) is articulated, because an abstraction is hardly sensible, so it seems; and one feels quite sharply [vivement] how this expression, “limpid star-­like abstraction,” suggests…",

      "text": "6 Introduction one of the goals of my excursion into Levinas’s contribution to the Sodom archive is to point up how his insights’ ﬁ gural traits give heft to his claim that the call for justice primordially arises from the everyday discrepancies and challenges that shape the rhythm of being in common with others. The call to “compare the incomparable” serves, in the ﬁ rst instance, as a reminder that the ethical relation is not an absolutely private affair or folie à deux in the delirium of inﬁ nite responsibility. To “compare the incom- parable” means to recognize that there are plural expressions of alterity to contend with—and to dwell with.17 Derrida’s debt to Levinas is famously complex and ambivalent, yet his insistence that the “dilemma” at hospitality’s heart is “irreducible” carries an unmistakable Levinasian accent. Radical vigilance, however, is not the only factor.…",

Is it at all surprising that the very indistinction that Agamben’s images capture is itself, as he puts it, a mark of “specialness,” with special relating to species, which in turn relates to specious or, in its obsolete deﬁ nition, beautiful (58)?

My focus here is, as Sharma puts it, “to carefully detail the processes by which objects come into being as objects” (2015, 14). Part of this com- ing together entails an ontological aspect by which cinema came to be in the world but this coming into being also entailed other dimensions including cultural praxis and affect. For present purposes, affect becomes a crucial element in the coming to being of cinema as an understandable and relatable cultural object.

And I have likewise demonstrated how we might think about what other forms of unknown and unaccounted for expression inhere in our distant sense of audition, moving away from the (sometimes automatically) privileged epistemologies associated with the proximal senses of touch, taste and smell. This has allowed me to elaborate ways we might conceive of images as resonant and listening, rather than tactile and caressing.

It is the bodily, and therefore the spatial/material, focus of Merleau- Ponty’s phenomenology that is of most relevance to our current inquiry. This distinguishes this version of phenomenology from the work of other inﬂ uential phenomenologists such as Edmund Husserl (1859–1938) and Martin Heidegger (1889–1976).

And Karen Barad proposes an “agential realism” in response to the continuing paradoxes of quantum mechanics (2007, 132–85). In this book, I both reconsider Whitehead’s thought in the light of speculative realism and new materialism and suggest revisions to these latter trends from a Whiteheadian standpoint. Let me summarize the remaining chapters briefly. The first chapter, “Self-Enjoyment and Concern,” compares Whitehead’s stance on",

In this way, the encounter with the Other makes an ethical demand on me, one that marks me even if I refuse it. This encounter is a kind of primordial trauma: it suspends and overwhelms the innocence of “living from,” the economy of sensibility, enjoyment, and satisfaction. The naïve self-presence of primordial sensibility is dissolved and replaced with a new sort of subjectivity: one that is always already in default, obligated to an “idea of infinity” that “exceeds my powers” (196). The call of the Other in Levinas’s philosophy is its own authority; once I have heard this call, I cannot escape it or ignore it. Even to reject it is still to acknowledge it in an inverted way; as Levinas shockingly says, “the Other is the sole being I can wish to kill” (Levinas 1969, 198). This is why, for Levinas,",

The Monstrous-Feminine, however, provides what is still one of the most sustained and inspiring engagements with Kristeva in the context of film analysis. Other film theorists have made reference to Kristeva’s thinking yet very few have placed her work at the heart of their interpretive framework.3 The centrality of Powers of Horror to The Monstrous-Feminine cannot be underestimated.

It is hardly satisfying to suggest that if the current of existence is secret, there is a still larger secrecy having to do with everydayness. Yet this unappealing path must be pursued. If we can grasp the manner in which daily life is taken for granted, we can perhaps understand the way in which the current of existence ﬂows through our lives. Fortunately, there is a point of access to the taken-for-grantedness of everyday existence; it resides in what we take to be typical in our experience. Typically, in ordinary life, I am at the center of my perceptual uni- verse.

References to cinema are extremely rare in his work and serve a purely illustrative function. Moreover, while he does not explicitly criticize ﬁlm, his philosophy manifests an abiding suspicion of the aesthetic and the visual, which he associates with forms of domination and violence.

Because of this pre-cognitive multi-sensorial contact, the world has a uniﬁed appearance within the perceptual ﬁeld. Among the most signiﬁcant aspects of Merleau-Ponty’s elaboration of the bodily experience are his insistence on the primacy of the sense of touch, and his emphasis on the active, expressive body. He argues that tactility gives the fullest articulation of the object’s visual properties. From the sense of touch, which localizes an object in its environment, the other senses formulate an understanding of that object’s implicit nature, including its colour and organization in relation to other things and one’s own body.

So as to reopen rather than conclude this discussion, we would like to indicate briefly the avenues explored by these seminars. In these seminars, Lacoue- Labarthe puts The Instant of My Death to the test of a number of rifts that chart The Writing of the Disaster, in particular all the sequences organized by “a very explicit, almost brutal, and appar- ently irrevocable challenge to those two motifs” essential to The Instant of My Death—that is, autobiography and etymology. For example, Blanchot’s entire book wrestles with the role played by the word “disaster,” inevitably marked by its etymon, whereas, fourteen years later, The Instant of My Death",

Amelia Jones has pointed out that when Flanagan performed as a masochist he was \"attempting to externalize his internal pain,\" which for him had the pleasurable effect of \"reducing the pain of illness to the less ambiguous agony of the definitively physical.\"15 Unlike the work of other artists I have discussed in this book, Flanagan's per- formed pain seemed to go hand in hand with pleasure.

Derrida’s excavation of this humanistic kernel in Levinas’s thought affects the deployment of his “hauntology” with phantom persecution films. While Derrida links the specter to a who, it is precisely this space that is stripped of humanist pretenses—expanding the view of the phantom beyond hostile human antagonists or wronged victims opens the possibility for an alterity/ alterities that need not be marked primarily by the human.9 As the source of the spectral assignation is unmoored of humanistic, chauvinistic and",

I then turn more directly to Nancy’s text to bring both the “phenomenological experience” of singularity as well as its conditions. Nancy, along with others (including Adorno, Levinas, Derrida) emphasizes that insofar as all beings are singular, our cognitive, ethical, political, and legal attempts to “determine” the singular being are necessary for thought and experience to proceed but at the same time necessarily incapable of “capturing” the singular being qua its singularity. …",

Her brazen sexuality, alive from before she drew Dora Maar and always strong, could be misread so as to identify her only as a romantic or a good fuck. She was a good fucker. The pornerotic body subverts simple romanticism and sexualization, for it smells, smiles, bleeds, and shits, thus living beyond the boundaries of fine art's myths and murders.

I do not evoke these phenomena solely to draw your attention to the transformation of the regime of the “beautiful” in contemporary society. Neither do I do so to pose the question of the role of psychoanalysis in this change. Messenger of truth as it is, is not psychoanalysis, when it is vulgarized and ceases to be experienced as a process without end, exploited as an alibi for fetishism, narcissistic complacency, and the general perversion of discourse and behaviors? More gravely, it is concerned with the modern representation of the meaning of life. We could “encode” or “ﬁ lter” porn ﬁ lms and other violent media as much as we want, but no restoration of the prohibition will withstand the reign of the society of the spectacle, or a life in which meaning is banally choked in pleasure for pleasure’s sake.

Even if only loosely based on personal experience, it is an extraordinary social document, remarkable for its psychological acuity yet ultimately inconclusive, with neither Galesia nor Bosvil allowed an unambiguous insight into the other’s feelings. Each blames the other for obscuring his or her intentions, but Galesia also blames herself, though she has done all that a woman ought to do when importuned by a suitor, never once betraying an affection that might be interpreted as encouragement. But as Galesia sets out the case against herself, she acted on suspect motives, allowing a secret pride, disguised as modesty, to govern her actions. That is, she was modest because she was too proud to be indiscreet, her behaviour driven not by the love of that virtue with which she should honour her Maker, but by an effort to look good: How far my Looks, or Gestures, might betray my Thoughts, I know not; but I kept my Words close Prisoners, till they should be set",

Furthermore, my discussion considers how Labe's richly poly- valent, sometimes eroticized diction subverts conventional gen- der categories and proposes new models of female agency that will be enacted in her other works. The third chapter turns to Labe's only other narrative work, Le Debat de Folie et d'Amour, a long mythological prose dia- logue that pits the allegorized figures ofAmour and Folie against one another in a complex ethical argument over their respec- tive powers and identities during a banquet at Jupiter's court. 10 5",

His hallucination is of Ruth, in a scene filled with shimmering gold and red, as a multi-armed Eastern goddess. P.J. has placed Ruth in the position of guru, indicating that what he seeks is her jouissance, not his own. P.J. fantasizes jouissance as love or plenitude, which erases the radical kernel of jouissance. Campion depicts his fetishizing of feminine jouissance as a psychotic breakdown.

Our sensory exploration of the object is always “incomplete,” and there is “a depth (profondeur) of the object that no progressive sensory deduction will ever exhaust” (PP, 216). This, we may grant Merleau-Ponty, is a fact of our perceptual experience. But what does it prove? The “depth” of the object is part and parcel of the perceptual meaning the object discloses to our body. Merleau-Ponty derives this meaning—predictably and correctly, given his entire theory—from the body’s general and prepersonal grip upon the world: “what we in fact have, is consciousness of an inexhaustible object, and we are sucked into it because, between it and us, there is this latent k…",

His engagement with philosophy and the philosophy of his milieu is on display in this paper—an interest registered from the first paragraph where he writes that the formation of the ‘I’ ‘is an experience that leads us to oppose any philosophy directly issuing from the cogito’. It gives advance warning of an engagement with Descartes and the ‘philosophical subject’.",

Curiously, Genette immediately quali- ﬁes his reference to Barthes as ‘perhaps an impudent one’ that ‘requires neither elaboration nor comment’ (p. 399). He closes down the avenue for further elaboration of what this palimpsestuous reading might be, resorting to the more conventional structuralist ﬁguration of literature as a game and of reading and writing as a form of play. Genette’s reference to Barthes is, however, a crucially important one, serving as another signi- fying complex that alerts the reader to the geno-text of Palimpsests.

It pursues conceptually the question of how people maintain their binding to modes of life that threaten their well- being, and to do this it recasts the object of desire not as a thing (or even a relation) but as a cluster of promises magnetized by a thing that appears as an object but is really a scene in the psychoanalytic sense.

Deleuze has not produced a theory of film signification. Rather, through close observation of tempo- ral formations in cinema, he has produced a philosophical context and a taxonomy of the different constructions of cinematic movement and time, and the ways cinema evokes and creates images of the shifting structures of thought in an evolving society. Most important for a study of avant-garde film is his emphasis on the experiential aspects of cinema as an aesthetic encounter with duration that generates a complex web of shifting ideas about what constitutes the present. Like much avant-garde film, Deleuze's ideas at once challenge older conceptions of the movement of time and reveal new potentials for cinema as a means of thinking in time.…",

More often than not, commentators erase the feminist backgrounds of innovative thinkers such as Braidotti, Butler, or Donna Haraway while borrowing their ideas.4 In this introductory chapter, we engage with three main questions. First, what can a book that centers on one philosophical subject—one author—possibly mean in the early twenty-first century? Second, we read Braidotti’s oeuvre and its subject matter through one of their conditions of possibility: biographical routes that will take us through several decades, continents, and institutional contexts. This part of the introduction mirrors Braidotti’s own afterword to this volume, a text printed before the “Rosi Braidotti Bibliography 1980–2013.” Third, we introduce the rationale of the three parts of this volume: The Concept of the Posthuman, The Politics of the Academic, and The Ethics of the Nomad.

Perhaps most importantly, she petitions us to become contemporary, that is, to accept that technological and commodified processes have now entered into the material field of embodiment and that they constitute our historical present—we can no longer seek recourse to a nostalgic idea of the human to guard against such processes. Indeed, we must accept the present, precisely to know the resources we have to make the future. In fact, her argument, if I follow it well, is that we can find within such processes the dynamic of disassembly and reassembly that is also, perhaps paradoxically, our hope.

Accidents will happen, the unexpected, unpredictable and uncontrollable will take place, chance and the contingent will present them- selves, so what should be the quality, she seems to ask, of our responsibility for our non-responsibility? It is signiﬁcant that Malabou explicitly sides against Descartes in coming back to that question. Descartes’s Discourse on Method has long been received as a response, if not an outright disciplinary rejection of the conversational, anarchic – and indeed, self-confessedly ‘frivolous’ – nature of",

She emphasises the fact that the “biological body, if it exists at all, exists for the subject only through the mediation of an image or series of (social/cultural) images of the body and its capacity for movement and action” (Grosz 1994, 41). The phantom limb, in her account, raises questions about the continual transformation of the body image.

The conceptual starting point for my exploration of these practices is where Louis Althusser, Michel Foucault, and Judith Butler converge in reﬂecting upon the condition of subjectivity—perhaps an obvious place to begin, but one that bears some explanation. Subjectivation, the term I am using to consider the modes through which self-starvation obtains its most profound political impact, has become the preferred translation for Foucault’s assujettissement, a concept that folds subordination and agential subjectivity into the very same f…",

There is no ‘other’ enjoyment towards which desire can tend, no heterogeneous object, value, force which one can love or hate.16 Detaching itself from all reference to utility or reason, eroticism became the imperative mode of sovereignty for the whole system that ceased to serve or even register the needs and desires of human consumers. Needs and desires quickly became pre-figured, pre-written in the ‘potlatch’ of supply and the rapidity of technological innovation and change with which human beings struggled to keep pace.

The foremost figure with whom they might think about this limit and human finitude is Heidegger. I find Heidegger’s analogy of reaching for the absent hammer useful and instructive. Just as the hammer’s being—its network of relations and its significance—shines out when confronted with its absence when one reaches for it in the workshop, so too in the confrontation with one’s mortal horizon of death, one’s authentic being is illuminated (cf. Thacker, 2015, pp. 66–67). Instead of living in the empty circulation of routine speech and social roles, the self appears as singular, given, wondrous, even numinous: “only the horrifying possibility of losing one’s world as a whole can reawaken,” according to Heidegger, one’s forgotten “primordial astonishment before the world” (Miller, 1992, p. 57).",

In fact, today’s culture is woven with atavisms as modern art recaptures tribal artifacts, as extreme emotions are driven by the most archaic compulsions. Bataille did realize that art no longer aims to depict beauty that materializes an angelic ideal, as today the religion of a universal and paternal God is giv- ing way to a resurgence of the epiphany of sublime in transitory events. The editor of this book points out that Bataille’s work on political econ- omy, The Accursed Share, is the least discussed, but likely the one most rele- vant to the most urgent theoretical tasks of today.

The text is written in the imperfect, the tense of narration. We read the text, led on by the imperfect that makes us believe that it is past, but at no point does the text make us believe that something is past. In this mad text, there is not outside and the past is still here. The Madness of the Day may be a text on God, on madness become God. It is as if Blanchot said: What if I took myself for God?

On the Edge of Afﬁ rmation: Derrida It might well appear a strange decision to begin with the work of Jacques Derrida when one of the key features of contemporary afﬁ rma- tionism has been its tendency to claim to have surpassed or exceeded deconstruction. The persistent characterisation of Derrida’s oeuvre in negative terms – inﬁ nite deferral, delay, marginality, anti- systemic fragmentation and, at worst, theoretical and political paralysis – has often been the starting point for the articulation of new afﬁ rmative alternatives. To take one instance, Alain Badiou, in relation to artistic practice, argues that we must ‘renounce the delights of the margin, of obliqueness, of inﬁ nite deconstruction, of the fragment, of the exhibi- tion trembling with mortality, of ﬁ nitude and of the body’.1 Regarding these forms as complicit with the ideological dynamics of contemporary capitalism Badiou opposes to them the need for ‘monumental construc-",

Fiedler, Husserl), anthropological the- ory (H. Jonas, Flusser, Belting) and event philosophy (Heidegger)19, then Deleuze’s concept of image fits in with perception theory and event philoso- phy. Let us now take a closer look at his concept of image. As laid out at the start of this book, Deleuze attributed to the Modern cinema asserting itself after the Second World War the power to restore to the damaged offspring of the Christian and Cartesian traditions their belief in the world, to renew the torn bond between the subject and the object. Deleuze formulates his theory under the heading: “Thought and cinema”.",

A central question that he sees arising from the latter parts of the project pertains to how a modern subjectivity may reject a desire that has become dominated by Law and rediscover ‘the body and its pleasures’ (Deleuze 2006a: 87). The date is crucial here – the work on Foucault was published in 1986, that is, after the two Capitalism and Schizophrenia books that Deleuze wrote with Guattari. Deleuze suggests that Foucault provides at least the basis for an answer to the question of how we would name ‘this new dimension, this relation to oneself that is neither knowledge nor power’ (Deleuze 2006a: 87).

She describes how three diﬀerent gazes are associated with ﬁlm: the gaze of the camera, the gaze of the audience and the gaze of the characters. However, Mulvey contends that the latter takes superiority within conventional ﬁlm, due to its illusionistic claim to reality, which contributes to maintaining ‘the neurotic needs of the male ego’ (1975: 18). Finally, to break this illusion – making the readers of the essay (and the spectators of ﬁlm) aware of the mechanisms that lie behind the pleasure associated with conventional ﬁlm – is to be understood as a ‘blow’ against traditional ﬁlm conventions.

Since 2000, there was an explo- sion of English-language scholarship on Deleuze’s philosophy as well as his writing on cinema, which made more prescient than ever Foucault’s oft repeated statement at the beginning of “Theatricum Philosophicum” (remarkably, written in 1970) that “perhaps one day, this century will be known as Deleuzian.”4 It was also more and more evident that the cinema books were having a profound impact on artistic practice in general, and on filmmaking in particular. Furthermore, as moving im- ages became more and more electronic and digital, the destiny of the time-image and its immanent relation to duration, so closely tied to analogical and photographic materiality, was thrown into question.

      "text": "We already know that capitalism itself is not realistic: it is com- posed of countless incomplete processes, floating values, half-baked schemes. No doubt this is its strength as a representational system: individual agents must bear, to very different degrees, the risks of failed representation (bad money, bad deals) without endangering the structural mechanisms that allow the accumulation of value (cap- ital as such) to continue. As we trace and retrace the working of this system, we should remember that our motives, as Kluge reminds us, always spring from a kind of protest, whether that is expressed in an- ger or hope, refusals or wishes. Critical reading is nothing other than the practice whereby we keep learning how to tap into this reservoir of psychic and social energies. It may turn out that nothing is less realistic than capitalism, except history itself. n o t e s 1 …",

First, Agamben’s work is in the tradition of post-Heideggerian philo- sophy, complemented by his grounding in Classical scholarship— ancient rhetoric, grammar, and poetics—and Roman jurisprudence. Second, and more importantly regarding my comments above, when Agamben discusses shame he does so with reference to survivors of Aus- chwitz. In RA (1999) Agamben discusses Primo Levi, and Robert Antelme, also looking extensively at the phenomenon of the muselmänner, repor- ted in survivor testimony. Nevertheless, despite this I do have significant misgivings as to Agamben’s conclusions and these I shall explore below. This chapter takes the following form: • Section 1 provides a schematic overview of Agamben’s project, so as to situate his discussion of shame. His discussion of shame can only be",

In this chapter, I argue that Foucault employs what I call a “skeptical method” that al- lows him to reject the ahistorical, universal claims that underlie humanism and foundationalism, while still engaging in social criticism. In fact, Foucault’s social criticism derives much of its force from his insistence that we question norms.

However, what Badiou overlooks is that certain strands within feminist, queer and postcolonial thought self-reﬂexively problematize the reiﬁcation of identity and resist the solidiﬁcation of political impulses into ethical ideol- ogy. Moreover, Badiou’s strategic attempt to recuperate the category of the universal as an alternative to both neoliberal discourses of tolerance and the ‘ethics of otherness’ exempliﬁed by Levinas, may be premature.

The three factors we have men­ tioned (the tacit but unequivocal aim of sensual pleasure; the deprecation of passio; the elevation of incapacity for emotion and devotion to \"prudence,\" \"good sense,\" \"vir­ tue\") constitute the sustaining idea, the true content of the speech.

Feminist film criticism addresses the problem posed by cinematic visuality for women within patriarchal cul- ture.

Though perhaps I could put it this way: Derrida’s language, its exuberance, and its color remind us that there is always an element of play in the death drive that keeps the very possibility of pleasure alive. Still, to imagine a Freud who would take pleasure in the hypothesis of the death drive, “one has to have ideas,” “il faut avoir des idées” (“SoF” 317/337, modied).

By concen- trating on the difficulty and ambiguity of the novel and then on the development of the metaphor of the bowl and the concept of “nothing,” I show how the novel creates a web of competing and contradictory God-ideas.

In offering a critique of the patriarchal and masculine character of these very notions of auto- nomy, independence and individuality, second-wave feminism has undoubtedly paved the way for a rethinking of women’s relations to these symbolic, secular attributes of power. Nonetheless, mainstream cinema tells a story that suggests that, when it comes to love, the self-sacriﬁcial imperative of the normative Christian logos continues to be an operating principle, especially as it concerns women. Returning brieﬂy to Girard on sacriﬁce: he distinguishes between the practices of religion and theology because he aims to ﬁnd a notion of love, in his case a Christian notion, that is not essentially sacriﬁcial. In a 1993 interview in the Journal of Religion and Literature (1993: 25) Girard responded to a question that arose from",

Once again, unlike decon- struction or catachresis, what “horroristic” readings enable is a recognition that the Gorgon must be faced if one is to comprehend that the human/humanity is also about horror and is often about removing/destroying heads and bodies. This is what really unsettles about horror and “horroristic” thinking. And this is a form of unsettling or radical disturbance that proponents and defenders of the metaphysics of human substance—even the most deconstructive thinkers among them—cannot accept or face. Some of Eugene Thacker’s recent writings may help us to understand this com- plicity or holy alliance against horror and “horroristic” thought. Affirming that",

Its brevity belies its signifi cance. Based upon previous books on Hegel, Heidegger, and Derrida, it is also marked, although less explicitly, by her most recent publica- tion in French, Les nouveaux blessés [Th e New (or Newly) Wounded], which is a reading of Freud from the standpoint of contemporary neurology. Combined with her book What Should We Do with Our Brain?, these works establish Cath- erine Malabou as an incredibly signifi cant thinker in the wake of French post- structuralism, with the concept of plasticity being her original, signature idea.

The paralysis of the action image reflects a severe trauma that freezes reality into dreamlike images of pure contemplation.

In this brilliant reversal of the terms structuring debates on essentialism, Braidotti suggests that the denial of any essential bond is a simultaneous assertion that women have nothing in common other than oppression. This chapter continues and elaborates on Braidotti’s longstanding concern with the ethics of feminism. Her sophisticated discussion of essentialism refers both to the history of metaphysics and the metaphysical nature of philosophy. It makes clear distinctions about the implications of sexual difference and essentialism in the political context, which is Braidotti’s concern, and their implications in the psychoanalytic context. These themes carry over to the next paper, where Margaret Whitford rereads Irigaray. In this major reinterpretation Whitford argues against the…",

In framing my reading of the poetry around Jacques Derrida’s thinking on the ghostly a nuanced interpretation of spectrality in the poetry can be found. While Heaney’s spectral turn, as it has come to be known, occurred from Seeing Things onwards there are reflections and refractions of ghostliness occurring throughout the poetry from as early as Death of a Naturalist. In terms of hauntology, its etymology can be traced to ontol­ ogy as in French phonology the words ontologie and hauntologie sound strikingly similar.

Indeed, the ontological status of woman and even of women has shifted for academic feminists in light of influential arguments showing that women, per se, do not exist. There exist upper-caste Indian little girls; older, heterosexual Latinas; and white, working-class lesbians. Each lives at a different node in the web of oppressions.

To grasp the import of the affective for Cixous’s proposition of corporeality and human subjectivity, we can think of her famous exploration of writing as a bodily practice – as the very écriture féminine she famously sketched in ‘The Laugh of the Medusa’ (Cixous 1976), where writing is done with the body, as a material-symbolic (or corporeal-linguistic) invention of modes of living and desir- ing other than those pre-scribed by the phallogocentric libidinal economy and its Symbolic order; an invention made possible precisely because the affective exceeds the prescriptions of the symbolic.9 Cixous’s work …",

In aligning oneself with death, one chooses destructive inward patterns of defense that preclude love and compas- sion and shrink one’s life space. One conserves life to avoid death.

The less defended indi- vidual feels more alive, has the opportunity to experience more freedom and independence, and has a greater chance to evolve and fulﬁ ll his or her human potential. Making this choice is what the authors refer to as life-afﬁ rming death awareness.

Thus, when Ellen marries John, she is not only his wife but also, through internalizing Alice’s model, his sister.

In this world, the feminine appears as a symbolic other who voluntarily subjects herself to eroticism: opened outward, limitless, she is an other that has in turn interiorized the other as she exteriorizes herself. In that way, female value and pleasure are reduced to functions of male desire and internalization of the masculine gaze. When women assume this structure of valorization, our autonomy is restricted: she is relegated to desiring being desired, and this is a form of coercion and the basis of the perpetuation of heteropatriarchy. Shay Welch has conceptualized this condition inherent to the regime of sexual difference as “existential eroti- cism.” This regime remits women to sexual slavery, anchoring their beings on an aesthetic of seduction, the stylization of desire, and a choreography of pleasure. Again and again it is necessary to stress that this regime…",

Psychoanalysis itself, practiced by both men and women, becomes, in Kristeva’s analyses, a maternal activity, as does much transgressive art.

By virtue of its passing, what we call the past cannot exist, and yet as Derrida says it continues to assert itself in the present in innumerable ways.

Derrida’s reproach had to do with the dearth or even the outright lack of psychoanalytic participation in the political realm. For Derrida, after the Freudian discovery of the death drive, defi ned as a tendency toward destruction inherent in human nature, one cannot say anything about violence or especially about cruelty without recourse to psychoanalysis. Although of course psychoanalysis on its own is not suffi - cient for thinking through these problems, nothing can be said about them without psychoanalysis. It is true, Derrida adds, that the world has resisted and still resists psycho- analysis. But psychoanalysts, too, have resisted and still resist the world when they have not refl ected, and do not refl ect upon, the problem of cruelty, defi…",

Desiring- machines denote the production of intensities on all levels and in all modes of being. Sexuality is transformed from a ‘dirty little secret’ into a productive energy. This requires the power and potential of sexuality to be freed from the cage of the ‘daddy-mommy-me’ triangulation of psychoanalytic desire.

Who would choose to believe in a God who would allow such deaths? For the believer we have precisely the opposite problem than that faced by the nihilist. This is the dilemma that arises from the lack of a transcending principle at work in the world that would provide justice for the departed.

Part of the prob- lem lies in that distressingly common tendency either to totally accept or totally reject, as opposed to the principle of examining critically. Few today appear to read Freud or Marx with a view to sorting out what is still valid, what can be cast off, and what needs to be rethought. Freudian theory is vulnerable to attack on many points, but not, in my opinion, on the one that formed The American Nightmare’s psychoanalytic basis: the theory of repression and the “return of the repressed.” We can all trace the workings of this, surely, in our own personal histories and daily lives; it continues to have great resonance in relation to the horror ﬁlm, but only insofar as it is melded with a political awareness. Murnau’s Nosferatu (1921), made in the very shadow of Freud, strikes me as almost textbook Freudianism – the monster as “return of the repressed” (and its",

If libidinous, bodily forces are always already constructions of the prevailing discursive structure, then it is difficult to see how any subversive gestures are possible, let alone the “full-scale refusal of the symbolic” that she seems to demand from Kristeva. Butler’s demand for a totally subversive, yet “culturally constructed body” (119), realized as a “knowable experience” (102), is not matched by the formulation of an agency that could bring it about. Her own suggested solution to heterosexual hegemony, a “subversive” gender parody, can only function within the confines of the culturally constructed body, as a repetition of the prevailing gender laws, so is far from being able to provoke a complete overhaul of these laws. This is not to say that gender parody is without its subversive possibilities, but they seem",

Such a perceived failure is a central theme in Agamben’s work, threading together all of his differ- ent projects and interests: The history of humanity is always a history of phantasms and of images, be- cause it is within the imagination that the fracture between individual and impersonal, the multiple and the unique, the sensible and the intelligible takes place.

And so, in Merleau-Ponty’s many vivid examples of how touch elaborates vision and creates a passage to the world and others, a certain hierarchy is established through active gestures that ultimately cover over the other and the world: my hands form tirelessly; my body clasps the other’s body; my eye envelops and palpates the world, and so forth.

As the narrator, having read his thought in the eyes of the poor, turns to read it again in the eyes of his companion, we understand that “authentic” love is merely the desire for the same: the unexceptional desire to read one’s exceptional self—to read oneself and to see oneself read, reread, published everywhere.

So, for Kristeva, the subject is produced through a range of social structures which serve to highlight the subject’s initiation and inser- tion into the symbolic realm; the acquisition of language being the key here. Underlying this language there exists an unconscious, unspoken semiotic which is in turn controlled by energy charges in the drive of the chora. What we ﬁnd here is the suggestion that there is an inevitable lack of unity. The subject is constituted through a series of drives and encounters with the world over which he/she has no conscious control.

In showing how Labe produces an arena in which the other is welcomed, Baker offers us the figure of the poetess work- ing toward a union that is idealized as an event only insofar as it is a meeting deferred. Baker underscores the degree to which a struggle is omnipresent. Each poem discerns the immediate moment of a movement toward union. We are given a vital and healthy view of a relation of both writing and being in terms that are anything but idyllic. Thus, in the fifth sonnet, the woman's voice seems resigned to a life of tears but ultimately becomes a struggle to obtain a voice and, at the same time, to discover in language unnameable forces of desire: Clere Venus, qui erres par les Cieus, Entens rna voix qui en pleins chantera, Tant que ta face au haut du Cielluira, Son long travail et souci ennuieus.

      "text": "Instead, in making the feminine 'other', Levinas opens up the bias of language and the bias of metaphysical desire. The question of sexual difference is brought into the arena of ontology and ethics. In this arena, where femininity is 'other' to philosophy, Levinas states his interests and hence falls into this pattern, but at the same time he addresses the relation and problematizes it. Thus the accusation of a simply reactionary attitude towards women becomes more difficult to make. Levinas attempts to reconsider the relation between women and concern for the interior space, which is both, in Levinas' terms, 'the dwelling' and 'being at home in the world'.13 This desire for an ethics based on community both looks back to what Levinas calls 'an unrecuper- ated, pre-ontological past of maternity', and forwards to reconcilia- tion. Nevertheless, Levinas is writing in a framework articulated in terms of sexual difference. Despite the attempts to disavow the 57",

Michel Foucault certainly brought atten- tion to the disciplinary technology of prisons—and their pervasive, intrigu- ingly transferable social structures—many years ago. But his still later interest in biopolitics—which shifted emphasis from the disciplinary work on bodies to the biological functions of and within bodies—has inspired yet another wave of fascinating thought about the evolution of modern institutions. And with even more force than the disciplinary model, his thought has renewed interest in the problems surrounding the notions of political right that served as the foundation of liberal and radical political and legal discourse during the French Revolution and its aftermath.

Very quickly, Merleau-Ponty elaborates on his position. Our perceptions, taken only as sensations, are private, ours alone, but if we take them as acts of the intellect, they are changed. He states that “if perception is an inspection of the mind, and the perceived object an idea, then you and I are talking ab…",

Henceforth, each time that a sharp screaming strikes the ears of the subject, whether a scream proffered by the other, or a new scream from the subject itself, the pain reappears as a memory in the flesh. By hearing the scream, the subject feels an inexplicable physical pain. The scream is thus not only a figure of pain, it can also be, because it is a memory, an excitation that leads to a painful sensation without an identifiable organic cause. It is as if the sensation was a hallucinated pain. The sequence of our reasoning would be as follows: the scream reflects pain, the scream refracts pain, and then the scream triggers pain. It shows it, marks it, and engenders it as a hal- lucinated production. To read these pages of Freud in light of what Lacan has taught us, we rec- ognize clearly two important articulations. The first is as follows: the relation between the scream and the hallucinated pain is a perfect example of the",

Thus, the encounter of death reverberates with the absence of myself to myself. Death is a reminder of that withdrawnness of myself to myself and it res- onates even in the death of the other. Even though the thinking subject cannot reasonably think its own death, the death of the other is remind- ing us about our own anxieties.

While long-lived legends such as those of Veronica's Veil, St. Luke Painting the Virgin, Pygmalion and Galatea, the Corinthian Maid, and Apelles Painting Campaspe contrib- ute to our understanding of the history of Western art, the legend of Zeuxis Selecting Models stands apart.

Given Agamben’s messianic pathos that afﬁrms the destruction of all hierarchies, we should understand ‘perfection’ in this statement not in the sense of excellence or supremacy, but rather in the sense of fruition or accomplishment. The perfection of the sovereign power of bare life is precisely its exhaustion through praxis (Agamben 1999, 171; 2005, 88). The universal weakening of power that will accompany the retreat of biopolitics will therefore not mark a limitation of the human ‘will to power’ but rather its fulﬁlment, the achievement of the condition, ‘in which a sense of serenity would be ﬁnally attained and life truly afﬁrmed’ (Deleuze 1988,",

Introduction From Roy Bhaskar's early work we have learned that, if experimental practice is to be intelligible, the world must be a particular way. First, objects must be capable of behaving differently in open and closed systems. For this reason, the being or substance of generative mechanisms cannot be identified with its actualized qualities, but must be located elsewhere. It is only in closed systems, Bhaskar contends, that constant conjunctions of events in cause and effect relations obtain. In open systems, by contrast, objects can remain dormant, producing no events at all, or the intervention of countervailing causes can either a) hide events produced by objects, or b) produce events different from those that the generative mechanism or object would produce in a closed system by virtue of how entanglements of obj…",

It focuses on op- pression as the main constituent of identity and leads to the additive naming of kinds of victimization on the basis of race, class, religion, sexuality, national origin, ableness, and the by-now formulaic “et cetera” and “so forth.” At times, this discourse expresses a kind of interminable negativity evident in the pileup of oppressions, with its implicit hierarchization of suffering. But this discourse has also developed a dialectical analysis whereby the multiplication of oppression creates its antithesis, a multiple richness and power centered in difference, as Audre Lorde theorizes in “Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redeﬁning Differ- ence” (1980).

The presence of male onlookers in both Countess Dracula and Lust for a Vampire resonates with Mulvey’s remarks regarding the alignment of the view- er’s gaze with than of male protagonists onscreen, while the absence of any such character in the waterfall sequence resists this. Indeed, the sequence from Byzantium recalls Mulvey’s characterization of the typical representation of male subjectivity in classical Hollywood cinema in terms of the ﬁgure in the landscape (1989, p. 20).

She imbues it with a strong narrative element, which suggests she has discovered that no single genre communicates all that needs to be known about the suffering of others. While fiction can provide an education in sympa- thy, or at least an education about it, criticism directly warns readers about the dangers of easy sympathy.

To perceive a natural thing implies not only the awareness of my perception but also of the fact that others perceive the same thing. To reflect on myself implies that I am aware of my being for others. In fact, Merleau-Ponty comes up with the same four-term system that we find in Sartre’s Being and Nothingness: “my being for me, my being for the other, the for itself of the other, and his being for me.”48 One should note, however, that whereas for Sartre this four-term system con- stitutes human existence, for Merleau-Ponty it articulates the opening of a",

Because film offers ways of capturing images of the present which, as soon as they are photographed, become images of the past, then film offers unique ways of conceiving of the relationship between the past and the present. Deleuze considers that a range of films which emerged after the Second World War took certain aspects of memory as a theme—the “flashback,” for example, became a staple of Hollywood cinema during the 1940s.2 It is therefore films like this, which deal with memory to a large extent and with the relationship between the past and the present, …",

The aim of these counterfactuals is to ask what might have been different if humans had not been exceptional in disturbing the natural order of the planet. She concludes that the “dream” of a “good Anthropocene” through geoengineering, “a pure ecology in which everything serves to maximize everything else, and in which there is no cost,” could “be possible only by way of countless injustices,” including prominently those against women. The dream of a good Anthropocene, Colebrook maintains, enacts a logic “that marks all that has stood for humanism, posthumanism, a certain dream of history and of utopian sexual difference,” thus demonstrating that the “event of the Anthropocene is exceptional—­but not by being extrinsic",

That is to say that while the social relations endured by the wretch, as she implies, are to be made unwel- come, marginalised, put down, and perhaps also resented, she nonetheless refuses to remove herself – or the wretch’s rewriting – from the happy table where it happens that history is written. It is signiﬁcant that the metaphorical table in question is further particu- larised and indeed actualised as a dining table – for this is a domestic scene.

This type of thought cuts against both more conservative views that seek to justify a woman’s subordinate role by reference to her sexual identity and, at the same time, essentialist feminisms, such as that of Irigaray, that seek to ground resistance to patriarchy in the nature of being woman. If gender is a performative, then resistance can take the form of alternative performances, performances that are outside the recognized gender roles. Both Butler and Monique Wittig call for such alternative performances, although they differ on the role of language in these performances.

For Blanchot, literary criticism can show us how literary works both posit structures of meaning – carefully rendered characters with which to identify and empathise, codified emotions, psychological depth, social expansiveness, detailed and convincing environments – and destabilise such structures. In this way, criticism responds to an element of literary works that is easily forgotten, especially when fiction is understood through the lens of realism. By letting the “nothingness” of the work resound, criticism shows us what lies beyond the shaping of meaningful events and the evocation of psychological depth.

Moreover, she asserts, this rec- ognition of its nonexistence—or at least, muddiness—forms the sub- stance of feminism: “That ‘women’ is indeterminate and impossible is no cause for lament.

Instead the other is, for Levinas, a separate being constituted in her own terms. Readers of Levinas may object that his description of our ethical responsibility is unrealistic because the demands of the ethical relation, formulated in this way, could never be fulﬁlled.

Thus, Featherstone suggests a political reading of this ‘apocalyptic realism’ and suggests an alternate vision of the future, ‘a minor utopianism’ in the works of Guattari and Deleuze.

(Ziarek 2000: 147) Yet for all that Irigaray does not, as Ziarek notes, relinquish the sig- niﬁcance of difference, and especially the irreducibility of sexual differ- ence (ibid.: 145). Her strategy involves rather a movement back and forth between, or a simultaneous insistence on, proximity and difference: the two lips are, for example, both a sign of sexual difference and an image of proximity. In I Love To You this dual strategy of staging difference and proxim- ity is deployed through the re-articulation of love. In her engagement with Plato Irigaray already emphasises the intermediary character of love. As we saw in Chapter 1, Irigaray, agreeing with Diotima-Socrates, conceives love not as fulﬁlment but as movement between. In I Love To You the dynamics of the love relation are further elaborated.

The internal trauma is so upsetting and painful that its image remains imprinted not only in ordinary memory—which retrieves the past as conscious memory—but engraved in the depths of the uncon- scious, which is also memory, a quite different memory. In effect, the unconscious harbors the past but does not reflect it to the surface of con- sciousness. Thus, the pain of the trauma remains marked in the uncon- scious, but its return will take other forms than the mere recollection of an unfortunate episode. Certainly the person who has suffered a trauma can recall the circumstances of the accident, recover the unbearable feelings that he or she experienced, and live in the fear of a new attack, but there are the other forms of the return of the trauma that he or she ignores.

The book aims to explore these themes through two parts. The first part of the book aims to situate Serres in relation to the tradition of French historical epistemology, mainly Gaston Bachelard and his legacy. The second part of the book shifts to Serres’s own alternative and its legacy. This part consists of five chapters, each focusing on one dimension of this alternative: materiality, modernity, anthropology, religiosity and ecology. They aim both to highlight Serres’s own thought on these subjects and to map how they relate to, have been taken up or tra…",

In Butler’s (1990: 25) terms, gender is ‘performatively constituted by the expressions that are said to be its results’ and, equally, sex requires some kind of doing in order to generate meanings around it. Within this paradigm, sex and gender are performed rather than presented – there is no a priori standard against which performances are measured; rather, sex acts and gender performances are multivocal and potentially contested arenas in which sexual meanings and sexual rights are determined. Sexual rights and pleasures run through all strands of intimate relationships, and the tension between these two areas is perhaps most strongly evidenced in the area of marriage and the family.

The tenor of scientifi c rationalism has been to deny the rational nature of such statements; when I state that ‘killing is wrong’ or ‘that is beautiful’ all I am doing is expressing an attitude I have towards the object in question (Stevenson, 1963).

One of the goals of Gender Trouble is to problematise feminist understandings of the relation between sex and gender and, in particular, the emphasis of ‘French Feminism’ on sexual dif- ference.5 Developed initially to contest the idea of biology as destiny, the distinction between sex and gender allowed feminists to contend that whereas sex (the biological differences between men and women) is ﬁ xed gender is not.

In her view, \"taking a priori an antiessentialist stand may be politically right; nevertheless, it remains conceptually short-sighted\" (Nomadic Subjects, 1 85). I would argue, however, that for feminists as for anarchists, political concerns should be given priority over conceptual ones. 9. Durkheim's own work is not, however, particularly radical. Consider, for ex­ ample, his positive reflections on the division of labor which is to be found in any modern capitalist society: \"the progress of individual personality and that of the division of labor depend upon one and the same cause. It is thus impossible to de­ sire one without desiring the other\" (Durkheim, Division of Labor, 404-5). Equally troublin…",

While his arguments about a politics of being and stasis might work somewhat for Bennett, they do not work so well for Connolly who, as we will later see, is very much committed to change. Chandler suggests that such a politics of stasis is the outcome of new materialism and an intrinsic element of a posthumanist position. But it is not. There are as many political paths for post­ humanisms as for the humanisms of modernity.

Not some chaotic outburst, but a working and kneading of sound into written language and critical thought for the very purposes of expanding and multiplying possible meanings. The articulation and negotiation of these possibilities, I believe, marks a distinctive feminist enactment within the language of contemporary theory. In saying this, I would shift metaphors for feminist voice away from that of monster or Medusa or even \"big red mouth\" (as appealing as these remain for me), and suggest that we might well configure the feminist critical engagement in language in terms of a rather dexterous speaker, or perhaps a dexterous mover, like our orange cat seizing opportunities. The voice of this speaker would indeed be one that resonates, but also one, as Cixous says, that is hardly \"without a minimum of philosophical and…",

Changes in technologies of reproduction have accentuated the reproducibility of artworks to such a degree that their reproductions can become truly independent of their model and enter “into situations which would be out of reach for the original itself” (SW IV, 254). Benjamin partly characterizes this shift in terms of the ways in which reproductions of art- works today “meet the beholder or listener in his own particular situation,” thereby reactivating the experience of the artwork in previously unrealized ways (SW IV, 254). He also describes changes in the way the viewer under- stands his encounter with the representational mechanics of the medium, for instance, in the case of ﬁlm, whose audience, he argues, identiﬁes with the camera rather than with the actors as one might in the theater.

As conscious, reflective human beings (which for Schopenhauer is already assuming a lot), we live in the rift between the fear of death and dread of life.

The separation of the sexes described by French feminism appears to Chodorow to serve conservative political and economic ends. Resistance to the feminist separation that is the conclusion of French feminism, with the écriture féminine that is its subject, has been found both in France and in the work of influential American feminists. Among the most influential of these American feminists is Judith Butler, whose 1990 book Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity set out an approach that has since become known as ‘cultural’ or ‘postmodern’ feminism. Butler begins by explaining the significance of the term ‘trouble’ in her title. For men, as the subject of desire, ‘trouble’ is represented by the female ‘object’ of desire who unexpect- edly returns and answers the masculine gaze, who refuses the passive position of the feminine object and thereby ‘contests",

What separates Derrida’s work on the gift is, first and foremost, his refusal to reduce it either to a simple object of representation or to a mere form of exchange. As he explores in Given Time, what the work of phenomenologists such as Heidegger and anthropologists such as Mauss alike reveals, is the funda- mental, structuring role that gifts play for the spacing of time, the thinging of the thing, and the becoming subject of the subject. ‘The gift gives, demands, and takes time. The thing gives, demands, or takes time,’ Derrida writes of Mauss’s account of gift-giving in the Essay on the Gift.12 By this he means that there is no pure, h…",

But women face many incongruencies and contradictions, and those analyses that explicitly seek to valorize gender differences are particu- larly problematic: Think of requests for small services that, for a man in a certain position, would never be made (for example, taking a memo).

Simon Critchley makes the persuasive case that Derrida has been concerned with ethics, articulated in terms of the encounter between the self and the assignation from an inscrutable other, from the very onset of his work (2014, 20–31; 259). 7. Linked to his declamation of ethics’ priority to ontological and epistemologi- cal accounts (cf., for instance his essays “Is Ontology Fundamental?” [1996a] and “Philosophy and the Idea of Infinity,” [1996a, 56]; cf. also 1969, 42–48; 79, etc.), Levinas’s thought owes much to its phenomenological roots, the methodological approaches of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, which can be succinctly described as suspending traditional conceptual and philosophical prejudices and pre- conceptions for the sake of portraying phenomena as they appear. 8. Interpretations of what Levinas is actually up to in his ethical thought vary, rang- ing from Richard Cohen’s robust reading of it as an ethical exegesis “that supplies a",

      "text": "World-War-II art cinema offers us an image of “time itself, ‘a little time in its pure state’ ” (Deleuze 1989, 17). In the modernist cinema’s direct image of time, sheer duration is affirmed in its own right, and liberated from any subordination to narrative. But Southland Tales, as a post-cinematic work, is about the exhaustion of this image of time – or perhaps I should say, the exhaustion of temporality itself. This is evidenced by the way that digital media do not seem able to “communicate duration” – as David Rodowick complains, quoting Babette Mangolte (Rodowick 2007, 163). Just as the movement-image gave way to the time-image, so now the time-image gives way to a new sort of audiovisual or multimedia image: one lacking “the sense of time as la durée” Rodowick 2007, 171).60 What Rodowick sees as sheer loss, however – a reduction to “the ‘real time’ of a continuous present” (171) – …",

What, then, differentiates Barad from the correlationism of both phenomenology and quantum physics? While Barad may not provide an adequate or satisfying answer, her theory of agential realism and intra-action provide a way forward that both relies on material realism and enables measurement to occur apart from human consciousness. She mirrors Merleau-Ponty’s desire to weaken the border between the human who observes and that which is observed by focusing on the entanglement of all matter, including human consciousness. She rightly points out that “[t]he point is not simply to put the observer or knower back in the world (as if the world were a container and we needed merely to acknowledge our situatedness in it) but to understand and take account of the fact that we too are part of the world’s differential becom­",

It enables the world to have meanings, to be open to other senses. The subject is chosen by the other, and is thus not the active agent of moral choice. By facing the subject, the other makes the subject responsible for actions, and even crimes, which are not his or her own.

In the experience of pain there is often the immediate feeling that something external is directed against one, even though this something is located within oneself. It is identified as ‘not oneself’, as something so alien that it must immediately be disposed of. Simultaneously that same something is internalized in such a way that the person in pain may be dominated by a sense of ‘internal agency’. Thus when a knife enters the body, for instance, one will feel one’s own body, rather than the knife, hurting one (Scarry 1985: 52–53).

On the one hand, to think of equality and difference in pure terms of gender (sometimes using biologicist arguments that link sex and gender) is a reductionist and non-intersectional reading of how political subjectivities are constructed in patriarchal/androcentric systems. Furthermore, to speak of equality and differ- ence in purely gendered terms implies the creation of woman as a homogeneous subject erase or what this subjectivity may imply. In this sense, this book divides feminisms into intersectional feminisms and gendered feminisms. Gendered feminisms run over intersectionality, provoking the exclusion of the reality of millions of women and the exclusion of the reality of millions of men…",

In contrast to both the desire for puriﬁ cation and order, and the recourse to a mystical experience outside language, Agamben proposes what he terms an experimentum linguae – an experience, or experiment, in language – that would bring the factum loquendi to light. “Languages”, he argues, are “the jargons that hide the pure existence of language, just as peoples are the more or less successful masks of the factum pluralitas.

It is in response to and even anticipation of this gaze that the female body is ‘put on display’, and that a certain image of femininity is created – and such images are reproduced and distributed extensively and effectively, as Laura Mulvey has shown in her influential essay ‘Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema’ (1975).

Levinasian ethics witnesses the random and unavoidable onset of a perilous encounter with the breakdown of knowledge frames that are based on instrumental codes of separation and immunizing distance.

On the other hand, the time consciousness articulated in avant-garde art is not simply ahistorical; it is directed against what might be called a false normativity in history. The modem, avant-garde spirit has sought to use the past in a different way; it disposes those pasts which have been made available by the objectifying scholarship of historicism, but it opposes at the same time a neutralised history which is locked up in the museum of historicism. Drawing upon the spirit of Surrealism, Walter Benjamin constructs the relationship of modernity to history in what I would call a posthistoricist attitude. He reminds us of the self-understanding of the French Revolution: 'The Revolution cited ancient Rome, just as fashion cites an antiquated dress. Fashion has a scent for what is current, whenever this moves within the thicket of what was once.' This is Benjamin's concept",

While Levi is committed to fulfilling the demand that he make an ethical judgement, he sees himself as unable to make a legal judgement. Thus Agamben takes Levi to have made a discovery in his writing on Auschwitz. The discovery is what Levi calls ‘the grey zone’ (Levi 1989: pp. 22–51) where the distinctions between executioner and victim, good and evil become blurred. Of Levi’s conception of the grey zone, Agamben writes, What is at issue here, therefore, is a zone of irresponsibility and ‘impotentia judicandi’ (Levi 1989: 43) that is situated not beyond good and evil but rather, so to speak, before them. With a gesture that is symmetrically opposed to Nietzsche, Levi places ethics before the area in which we are accustomed to consider it. And, without our being able to say why, we sense that this ‘before’ is more important than any",

Furthermore, it is through Levinas's profound yet often hidden influence that the 'Other' has become one of the key concepts in much contemporary work, not only in philosophy but also, for example, in feminist and postcolonial theory. How- ever, the main thesis of this book is that a description of Levinas's funda- mental philosophical project is by no means exhausted by any reference to 'ethics'; indeed that the emphasis on 'ethics' and 'the Other' in the reception and dissemination of Levinas's thought has served to cover over both the basis and the specific details of this project.

The combination of depression and anger echoes the central polarity of the poem, between lethargy and anger. Persius's illness exhibits an affective ambivalence that matches that of the Eumenides Painter's Orestes.

Maurice Blanchot’s inquiries (L’Espace lit- téraire, 1955; Le Livre a venir, 1959) have a more philosophical character: Blanchot seeks to grasp the necessarily fugitive site where all literature originates, the metaphysical choice that leads the writer to produce his first line. Despite their authors’ genius— or perhaps because of it—these two inquiries have not really formed any kind of school (though they have not been without influence): their ideas may have seemed too dependent on the expression that sustains them to lend themselves to academic ex- trapolation. In the same period appear several other works of liter- ary theory in the modern sense, 1.e., which describe certain proper- ties of literary texts. Hence a study is made of point of view in the novel and the relations sustained between narrator and character (J. Pouillon, Temps et roman, 194…",

This idea was read as sounding the final death knell of cultural feminism and thereby ushering in a kind of paradigm shift for feminist philosophy. In Butler’s own words (1990, p. 33): “. . . gender is a repeated styliza- tion of the body, a set of repeated acts within a highly rigid regulatory frame that congeals over time to produce an appearance of sub- stance, of a natural sort of being.” She proceeds to contest the “com- pulsive heterosexuality” of our culture, which she sees as distorting the experience of heterosexuals as well as oppressing homosexuals. Butler’s concern here with the construction of identity and with the violent imposition of culture on the body reveal the influence of Foucault and his Nietzsche interpretation. In Gender Trouble, Butler describes her project as a “feminist geneal-",

Already existing outside the symbolic order, she possesses a clear perspective and understanding of the abyss on which it is founded. As she undertakes her personal journey into the dark night of abjection, she comes to realise that her only option is revolt. In acting against the patriarchal order, she is seen by its representatives as abject—even as a terrorist—but as Kristeva argues there can be grandeur in such revolt.

Apart from acknowledging that gender inequalities seem to survive the rearranging of inti- macy, they highlight that the new setting of love is the condition not only of more democratic ways of relating but also of confusion and power struggles. Even more pessimistically, Eva Illouz ( 2012 ) has lately argued that the institutional changes of modernity, whereby processes of commodiﬁ cation increasingly struc- ture intimate encounters and partnership, have made it more difﬁ cult to form intense bonds. Although the feminist body of thought is not her point of entry into the theme of love, Illouz also argues that, far from eroding, male dominance has taken on a new emotional form. Jónasdóttir, who is unique among feminist theorists in that she puts love at the structural centre of her theoretical system (1991/1994, 2009, 2011), notes that the",

Accordingly, the step to be taken prior to making this comparison is to engage with Collingwood’s discussion of philosophical method, in particular to consider the implications of his conception of “phil- osophical” and “empirical” modes of analysis which can be used to suggest ways to plausibly resolve some of the lingering perceptions of a disjunct between objects and imaginative experience. The “philosoph- ical” mode of analysis is characterized by Collingwood as necessitating a particular exercise of imagination, while the “empirical” mode is char- acterized as an exercise in exact scientific quantification.

And sexuality, whether gay or straight, is hardly the only liability of the female body; as Simone de Beauvoir suggests, the very ability to give birth—whether to a socially legitimate or a shameful child—makes the female body an uncanny threshold between life and death that provokes discomforting feel­ ings of mortality. Menstruation and birth are also productive functions—produc­ tive of uncontained flows and contaminating tissues—and they therefore register the female body as an uncontrolled site of excess and bared secrets, as Elizabeth Grosz has shown in Volatile Bodies. The body itself is therefore a starting point in under­ standing why the primal affect of shame has been assigned to femininity, and the chapters in this book begin with the question of the body in order to seek an answer to the long-proven yet heretofore baffling finding by researchers that women are more shame-prone than men.",

She herself interestingly argues that the commonly held view that her late work would mark a break from her early work indeed is a misunderstanding based on the ambiguity of the title of Speculum: “It’s been thought that in the second part of my work I turn my back on the first, that I renounce the first part. This error follows, among other things, from errors of translation in the title and subtitle of Speculum” (Irigaray 1995, 99).

Dick himself had averred, in 1966, that ‘religion ought never to show up in SF except from a sociological basis’ and denigrated his own novel The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch (2003b [1964]) for this reason (1995: 58)11 – antici- pating Suvin’s attempts to exclude all religious themes from science fiction (Suvin, 1979: 26).12 The disparity between this statement and the frequency with which gods, saviours and other quasi-divine figures do appear in his work",

Hence, we also contend that, although the relation between feminism and its objects is complicated and contingent, it remains impossible (and we would add, undesirable), to think through feminism without identifying desires, priorities and agendas.

The future is so strongly held in the grip of the past that even though we generally perceive it as open—a sphere of possibilities—at least fiction plays with the idea that there is some fatal force at work. Conceivably, what is indicated is just that human experience is as vast as the universe, and any attempt at harnessing it, will only give birth to new enigmas and other sets of spectres. We shall return to these aspects in a brief explication of epistemological desire below. First, we need to have a look at another rather recent contribution to the field of hauntology studies. Sadeq Rahimi’s The Hauntology of Everyday Life is very important for several of the chapters to come.

It appears that the term ‘meaning’ itself, as applied not only to art but to more general experience, has joined ‘truth’ and ‘reality’ in the class of words which can no longer be written unless apologized for by inverted commas.

Levinas’s work opens up new possibilities for expanding our understanding of love and its signiﬁcance not only for personal life but also for public exchanges and relations. ETHICS AND LOVE IN THE FACE-TO-FACE RELATION Ethics may be read as an elaboration of the centrality of love in the inter- human relation. The face-to-face relation – the relation to the other – demands that we take responsibility for the other, care for the other, and prioritise the other’s needs. While this demand, inherent within the encounter with the other, can be ignored – so that for example we can refuse to provide for the other, even murder the other – nevertheless human sociality rests on recognising the demand for care, generosity and selﬂess love, conveyed in the face-to-face encounter.

The authors of this naturalistic turn operate largely within a poststructuralist framework, with Gilles Deleuze as a major source of inspiration. Yet, following Deleuze’s own intellectual legacy, it has also become something of a commonplace among the new feminist naturalists to draw on Nietzsche and vitalist thinkers like Henri Bergson.

To do this, I will employ the phenomenological and ontological insights of Merleau-Ponty as a theoretical framework. In this section, I will provide a brief justification for employing Merleau-Ponty’s philosophy. In a widely cited text, M.C. Dillon argues that Merleau-Ponty offers two major theses in the Phenomenology of Perception: an epistemological thesis of the primacy of perception and an ontological thesis of the pri­ macy of phenomena (Dillon 1997, 51). Both theses are grounded in the world of pre-reflective bodily engagement. For Merleau-Ponty, the body and the world are not two separate entities that meet at some given time, but the body as body-subject is always-already in the world. In the",

For the apophatic movement of negative theology—a seemingly provisional interest in bodily life eclipsed by a concern for commerce with and within the disembodied life of inﬁnite divine real- ity—is not the only theological gesture that spells trouble for the embod- ied life of creatures. The problem posed by the apophatic gesture is also one of too great a distance, too radical a separation, between divine and creaturely reality; too absolute a sense of divine transcendence in relation to the ﬁnite realm of creaturely embodiment. This transcendence smacks of indifference (and so, ethically, of quietism) in the face of the needs, desires, and unjust sufferings of an embodied life. There is, however, a problematic theological gesture toward the divine that appears when we try to move in the opposite direction. This prob- lem arises when the difference and distance bet…",

But if the Oedipal thus remains as a problem in his understanding of pleas- ure and desire, then what are the implications and possibilities of this when it comes to his and Guattari’s understanding of capitalism? The link between capitalism and the Oedipal is at its most obvious, of course, in Anti-­Oedipus, but the way in which Deleuze and Guattari let their understanding of desire take off and differentiate itself from a post-­Freudian model continues to inform their philosophy at large. Identifying Deleuze’s understanding of pleasure as invested with an Oedipal trace that inhibits a fuller fruition of Deleuzian desire, this chapter considers the effects of this trace, its temporal implica- tions, and its possible reconfiguration in and through D…",

I offer the work of Kristeva and Irigaray as alternatives for rethinking the space of the symbolic, suggesting that women’s writing performs, by its audacious styles, the (re)production of new symbolic spaces in which woman’s desire can be spoken. I conclude that Irigaray’s work on gesture and speech serves as a provisional model for understanding and appreciating the (sexual) difference that women’s writing makes. Throughout the book I am confronted by the problem of identification. Writing a philosophical work on women’s silence means that to a significant degree women have become the object of my inquiry. This makes it difficult, at times, to decide whether to identify with or distance myself from my object. As feminist scholars…",

In the Visible and the Invisible, he seems to be questioning the privileged place of humans when he claims that “when we speak of the flesh of the visible, we do not mean to do anthropology, to describe a world covered over with all our own projec­ tions, leaving aside what it can be under the human mask” (Merleau-­ Ponty, The Visible and the Invisible 1968, 136). It has been well documented that Merleau-Ponty was unsatisfied with the work in the Phenomenology of Perception and wanted to escape the perspective of human consciousness. As such, the concept of flesh is built on a revers­ ibility that demands an ontological equality among objects. Humans can no longer claim absolute knowledge, or even the right to control or domi­ nate other objects, because we do not stand outside or above non-human objects.

The point is that they are temporally and historically in process and their future forms are not yet determined. Hence, the petition to become—and stay—contemporary calls us to a form of intervention and experimentation with the historical constellation of the material world in order to find modes of “sustainable becoming.” My own language falters here as I seek to understand the dynamic and even productive character of that",

Thus, the chair propre doesn’t lead into one single concept of flesh but rather into two: ontic flesh must be referred to an ontological flesh and a transcendental flesh all at once. One must therefore attempt to outline more precisely these two new senses of the flesh by reintroducing the polarity of the phenomenological correlation where Merleau-Ponty wanted to see only one mode of being.

We might add that the multitude appears damnably asexual here. Must we repeat it?

By the time Foucault embarks on his own project on sexuality, however, it becomes clear that while they both reject psychoanalysis as a means to understand sexuality and desire, Deleuze and Guattari end up with wildly different alternatives to the Freudian model. While Foucault ends up writing a history of sexuality, Deleuze and Guattari remould earlier conceptualisations of desire. And we can be more specific",

The second part of Chapter 3 reveals how this fraught discussion about the life-giving and death-dealing aspects of desire appear most vividly in modern feminist debates about pornography.

This was no less complex as O’Connor’s advice to Cyrus could be seen as perpetuating a traditional model of feminist generations or waves in the sense that an established feminist artist like O’Connor problematizes contemporary conceptions of feminist expression as demonstrated by Cyrus.

More is required of the body now than mere political allegiance or the appropriation of the products of its labor: The new discipline invades the body and seeks to regulate its very forces and operations, the economy and efficiency of its movements.

Indeed, his most crass pronouncement comes in the following scene, in reply to Bev Shaw’s sense that he likes animals: ‘I eat them, so I suppose I must like them, some parts of them’, he quips (p. 81). Coetzee is careful to discredit Lurie in this scene in which his shameful appraisal of Bev Shaw’s unattractiveness is given in lingering detail (through Lurie’s focalization, pp. 81–2).

That toward which his entire existence—his desire and his identity included—was aimed seems to be “a thing of nothing.” All of a sudden, the “lack of being” on which as a libidinal being he rests, threatens to rise up with- out protection to the surface. Here, there is no single signiﬁ er to deﬂ ect attention, while the presence of the audience prevents him from dreaming himself away (i.e., of fading away into his phantasm). A direct, unmedi- ated confrontation with this lack can no longer be avoided. Should his object undergo such a “sacrilege,” the subject—that is, the object rela- tion—can only creep away in shame and anxiety, unwilling to succumb to this confrontation. In his collection, a collector discovers precisely the phantasm so as to be spared this confrontation and this shame. This is",

This leads his thought of revolution into its confounding by hauntology, as observed by Derrida. Marx is caught up with ghosts, caught up in the paradoxes of his own ‘retrospeculative fiction’, unable to satisfactorily actualize the present in terms of either his fiction of the future or fiction of the past.

On the other, it reveals how affect is deeply tied to its actualization, and the experienc­ ing of specific emotions is the very basis for remarking upon their exis­ tence, which then occurs through their methodological documentation. The inseparability of affect and its emotive enactment works through, and undoes, the dichotomy of the discursive and the empirical, of what is rep­ resented at the level of the symbolic (often in metaphorical terms in rasa theory), and what it actually does to the emotive self.

After all, the “new” that Gramsci was seeing at the time was the rise and spread of fascism, and there was likely much about the “old” that he would like to see preserved and maintained in the future.

Throughout different stages in his thinking, Merleau-­Ponty retains this close connection between consciousness and material being. In The Structure of Behavior (1942), for instance, he introduces the notion of being-­in-­the-­world to refer to the way a subject organizes experience into meaningful and comprehensible configura­ tions. Perception is not consciousness of an already constituted world; it forms the world. The perceptual world is only given meaning, however, through a subject’s behavior, understood in terms of gesture, posture, and comportment or bearing.51 The perceiving subject is inherently embodied and the world is firmly grounded in the concrete and the material realm of perception. He more explicitly takes up the question of the lived body in his sub­ sequent work, Phenomenology of Perception (1945), in which he argues",

It is first of all an unsatisfied desire that initiates our own, one that is not filled up with meaning, or has no signified. That that desire is unsatisfiable is a secondary truth resulting from this primary condition.

Feminists who consider the subversive possibilities of irony are obliged to face these difficulties of intention and direction. Judith Butler, who orientates herself as a constructivist feminist, seeks to use the risks and disruptions of irony to interrogate prevailing notions of sexed identity and “essence.” Emphasizing the strategic dimensions of irony, she describes and advocates a form of “gender parody” which displaces what she calls the “law of sexual coherence” by revealing that “the original identity after which gender fashions itself is an imitation without an origin” (1999, 175). In other words, the authorial and intentional complications put into play by a purposeful enactment of the ironic mode displaces the very notion of an original “source” of being which, employed in the context of gender, can disrupt inscribed",

This is the material, poetic dimension of language (see Chapter 2 for Kristeva’s chora). It is the foundation of language for Kristeva, and is what she terms the ‘genotext’. (ii) The Symbolic: This is the syntax, the grammar, the expressed linguistic acts. It is the language of communication as we know it, and is what Kristeva calls ‘phenotext’.

And more importantly, it had since then become striking that The Instant of My Death was written following the same protocol: he speaks of himself in the third person (“he,” “the young man”).15 As a result, for me, there are two autobiographical texts by Blanchot: this one and The Instant of My Death. And I recall having thought at the time: what a show of absolute confidence he is displaying here by entrusting us—that is, people he doesn’t know, about whom he knows things perhaps only on account of what he has read of them—with a text of this kind. A text that was, at the time, a hapax in his work—there was no equivalent. PP: It is therefore a unique text. What might have happened, then, between",

Considering their essay ‘The Lesbian Poet’, I think about how Myles toys with gender in a way that is not dissimilar to Stein. While claiming a female destiny for themselves, Myles also creates a space to ‘become man’, which is only possible in moments of intensively felt freedom. These aspects of gender play are also realized in the way that Myles writes about sex, focusing on pornography particularly. Porn allows the writer to unpack their own poetics while considering how we are cultured to approach specific bodies in specific ways. Throughout their work, Myles carries a constant irreverence, with their speed of movement and lightness of phrase implementing a poetics of flippancy. This is, however, problematized through the…",

Furthermore, by its emphasis on literature, which is nothing less than a plastic work of writing, this books joins Malabou’s claim that the “plasticity is the metamorphosis of writing” in that it “configures traces and erases them to form them, without however rigidifying them” (2010: 61). Such a writing, always in the modality of that “smuggler”—and grounded in what Jean-Michel Rabaté calls “logos skouriatikos,” embracing “the rationality of corrosion doubling as generation” (2018: 113)—thus belongs to plasticity; a concept that, stronger than the formless, shows the productive tension and dialectical conflict between forms and their generative distortions.

According to Merleau-Ponty the failure of our metaphysical tradition to think brute Being is tied to reflexive thought that objectifies the world.This goes along with a primacy of vision.73 The objectified being is “seen” by the mind. Although the title of Merleau-Ponty’s book, The Visible and the Invisi- ble, clearly aims to point to Being’s invisible dimension, he seems to repeat the privileging of vision. It is true that he makes reference also to touch and some- times to hearing, and that in the model of the touching-touched hands visibil- ity seems to emerge from touching, but for him the “visible” often becomes synonymous for things perceived.The primacy of vision influences his account of perception insofar as it moves reflexively into a differentiation of perceiving",

Das’s discussion of pain’s intersubjective meaning is worth quoting at length: “In this movement between bodies,” she writes, the sentence “I am in pain” becomes the conduit through which I may move out of an inexpressible privacy and suffocation of my pain. This does not mean that I am understood. [And] this is not an indicative state- ment, although it may have the formal appearance of one. . . .

If the transcendent is understood in terms of the non-present or non-presentable, then it cannot encompass concepts like the pure or unconditional.

It is for this reason that Derrida is hesitant to describe his work as negative theology;9 this would be to offer a simple grounding in the transcendent as non-presentable. It is because of the implication of the present and non-present that Derrida offers neither a lack of ground or groundless ground as a starting point. This would return us to a reading whereby the face, the pure or the unconditional offers an originary ethics. The task at hand, then, is not to conceptualise ethics and politics in the light of a lack of foundations, but rather at the limits of foundations.",

In Levinas’s eyes, particularly in Totality and Inﬁ nity (1961), before even the Heideggerian ‘thrownness’ of the subject, there is, primordially, the subject encountering the Other and especially ‘the face’ of the Other (which can take many forms). This ‘relation between the Other and me’, Levinas writes, ‘issues nei- ther in number or concept’ at its most foundational, though there can, unfortunately, be later attempts to restrict its signiﬁ cance using such devices; instead, most immediately, the ‘Other remains inﬁ nitely transcendent, inﬁ nitely foreign; his face in which epiphany is pro- duced and appeals to me breaks with the world that can be common to us, whose virtualities are inscribed in our nature and absolute dif- ference’ (Levinas 1969: 194). At this basic level, until we un-ethically repress it, ‘the face speaks to me a…",

Even when an agent has successfully wrangled a sufh- cient subset of the multitude into alignment, this success will have forced the agent to undergo a trial that continues to inform and deform its own composition. Empowered to act by a sufficiently queued multitude, the multitude’s swarming complexity will still animate its representative agent in surprising ways. Even in cases where the agent is conscious, its “action is not done under the full control of consciousness; action should rather be felt as a node, a knot, and a conglomeration of many surprising sets of agencies” (RS 44). In this sense, the line between the conscious and the non-conscious, between the purposeful and the pur- poseless, between the intentional and the non-intentional, is blurred.

Even as he deconstructs the act of reading, Poe transposes the scene into an interpretive dilemma for the reader of Pym. For between the narrator's account of finding 'a dreary and unsatisfactory blank' on one side of the paper and Augustus' explanation that he penned his message on the back of the original",

In such accounts, Butler is positioned as critiquing both the ‘‘foundational assumptions’’ of earlier activism (1970s) and identity claims (1980s) in order to take feminism into a broader realm of relevance too (1990s and on). In this respect, citation of Butler, accompanied by a striking lack of engagement with anything she writes, performs Western feminist theory’s move fully into deconstructive approaches to the subject and the social world, and away from assumptions about feminist sameness and the re- iﬁcation of difference. More speciﬁcally, citation of Butler marks essential- ism and identity as in the past, and the subjects of a feminist theoretical present as different from and opposed to these earlier approaches. In the process, iterations of her threshold role in a Western feminist progress narrative erase any previous challenges to ‘‘womanhood’’ as an unqualiﬁed ground of feminist knowledge.",

More importantly, for our purposes, it is clearly evident that Lacan’s account turns desire into a by- product of signifying processes: desire is fundamentally internal to and structured by the workings of signiﬁers (language). It has nothing to do with primary processes, libido, etc. Lyotard accepts certain aspects of this account. He agrees (subject to certain provisos that we cannot explore here) that the loss of the mother is traumatic and also agrees that the acquisition of language marks a certain type of symbolic ‘castration’ (denoting accession to the social realm) but from his perspective this still does not refute Freud’s account of libido and the primary processes. Certainly, the loss of the mother marks a sense of ‘incompletion’ which compels the individual into a search for unity and totalisation, and discourse provides a means by which this loss can be provisionally structured and addressed through interaction",

There is one understanding of these virtues which is certainly widespread among analytical philosophers, and which directly serves the promise of ongoing research: that these are indeed the virtues of a science. Some philosophers who are impressed by this conception of what they are doing ritualize it into the forms of presentation familiar from the sciences. Sometimes this is mere scientism, but in other cases it signals the fact that their branch of phi- losophy is near neighbour to some science, such as quantum mechanics or cognitive science.

In the chapters that follow, Malabou’s interlocutors are sandwiched between three original chapters by Catherine Malabou and an interview in which she reengages some of the themes and considers criticisms brought out by the writers of the chapters within. Malabou has written of her own philosophical reading that she seeks to fi nd “a childhood to come in the text. . . . Childhood is an age that does not belong to either metaphysics or to its superseding and that, just like ‘metamorphosis,’ is both before and after history, mythic and ultrahistorical at the same time.”108 Th e reader is invited to take this same spirit of a plastic reading that the authors published here have applied to Malabou’s own texts.

One desires by relying on the desire of the other, so there has to be an elementary identiﬁcation with the other for desire to emerge. Lacan never tired of repeating that the subject’s desire is the desire of the Other, and we can paraphrase: the subject’s desire is the desire of the claque. One can easily see that with the claque one’s reactions, judgments, and opinions are al- ways framed in some way by the claque, which offers the entries, the attitudes, the proper ways of responding, and which instigates our wish to participate in the ﬁrst place. One has always already unwittingly started participating. If desire necessarily takes support in identiﬁcation, its crucial form is the identiﬁcation with the desire of the other.

      "text": "in mind. Here I read the diary closely to rethink the origin of Camera Lucida’s influential theory of the punctum. Where does life really begin for the concept of the photographic detail that ‘rises from the scene, shoots out of it like an arrow, and pierces’ perception (CL, 26)? Between 1980 and 2009, the answer tended to go without saying: in the photographic analyses of Camera Lucida. However, the publication in 2009 of the Mourning Diary complicated matters by casting new light on the development of the punctum and, more generally, on Camera Lucida. By examining the journal’s series of unsettling filmic encounters, I argue that the punctum has cinematic roots which are repressed in Camera Lucida and which did not become visible until the publication of the Mourning Diary. The ‘most quoted book in the photographic canon’ is not quite what it once was; an aspect of the afterlives of Roland Barthes has unearthed new elements, new vistas.15",

If pain is to be sought, it must be in the context of an end point, a desired outcome such as a tattoo or piercing; the pain itself is seen as a necessary horror to be endured. A wilful inversion of Scarry’s thesis in the unsurpassed The Body in Pain is instructive in elaborating on the relationship between pain and the generation of meaning. Scarry’s starting point is a concern with how physical suffering may structure the subject’s experience of the world around them and their position within it as subject or otherwise. One of her most vital claims is that physical pain carries with it the ability to ‘utterly nullify the claims of the world’ or to ‘unmake’ the world (Scarry 1985: 33).

Coming ‘with forced ﬁngers’, the poetic mourner acts untimely and unwillingly; his behaviour is ‘rude’ because it is itself the con- sequence of some ‘rude’ force. Before the deceased is even mentioned, the relentless power of his death is palpable: it demands conventional actions which the mourner would have wanted to avoid, as it provokes him into adopting ‘yet once more’ an elegiac language, a given repertoire of nat- ural tropes – laurels, myrtles, ivy, berries, leaves – which seems all but exhausted.

This disembodying reaches its culmination in the second volume of his study devoted to what he calls the “time-image.” In a certain sense, the time-image—an image that, rather than subordinating time to movement in space, presents time directly— can be understood as a realization of the cinema’s capacity to instance the uni- versal ﬂux of images, or more exactly, to divorce perception entirely from (human) embodiment.

The hard Barthesian ideas about originality seem to contradict Barthes’s own “The Death of the Author.” But these positions can be reconciled if we note that Barthes is trying to link not so much the Author but the conventions of discourse, particularly of writing. Barthes’s radical politics come through in his semiology, the study of signs. In trying to found this discipline, Barthes argued that bourgeois society impos- es symbolic meanings upon signs in order to force its values onto others. Those who dislike bourgeois society will find this sinister. Others will not. But later scholars did draw upon Barthes to argue that the imposition of symbolic order is not only based on class, but also on race, gender, and sexuality.",

At least superficially, Houellebecq’s depiction of the miseries of “liberated” sexuality (that is, sexuality subject to the laws of the market) sug- gests a causal scenario in which the commodification of eroticism brought about by Europe’s Americanization post-1968 has led to the “materialist hor- ror” of a completely liberal sexual economy, where both currency and flesh are traded on the open market.

The term subaltern refers to those oppressed, marginalised or colonised individuals and communities and was ﬁrst used by Antonio Gramsci, an early twentieth-century Italian social theorist, to refer to oppressed economic classes.

In the opening essay of the volume, “Rethinking Gender,” Gayle Salamon traces the recent history of feminist thought, particularly as it appears in the work of Judith Butler. Butler’s has been one of the most influential voices in recent years, particularly in feminist and queer theory. Her identity politics, however, is not essentialist in character.

This is the period of the refinement of the concept of 'le sémiotique' designed to help articulate the realm of the pre-symbolic, or that dimension of language which constitutes the basis of poetic language. At this time, too, Kristeva's debt to psychoanalysis begins to become more evident with the 'feminine' coming to disrupt the Name-of-the-Father as the embodiment of the paternal function (of father/mother/child triad - see Chapter 2), and thus the Symbolic as the order of language and signification.

Potentiality is indeed crucial in McFarlane’s critical rendering of assemblages, as it points to the excessive forces that overflow actual arrangements, thus opening up a space for imagining and practicing urban life differently. The critical potential of assemblages thus requires a commitment to making, to imagining and to assembling alternatives that might reshape the urban commons.

Third, there are a number of topics in feminist philosophy of mind that have so far been underexplored and undertheorized. For instance, while many have noted the relationship between perception and the mechanisms of sexism and racism, more in-​depth analysis is needed (Rohrbach 1994; Ngo 2017; Ortega 2019). We also expect that many emotions such as joy, regret, frustration, and equanimity that have not yet been examined in detail, as well as mental pro- cesses, such as sensation, attention, and imagination, will be further explored with a feminist perspective (Jones 2012; Kind 2013).

In the second chapter, “Georges Bataille: Erotic Experience,” I explore Bataille’s economy of erotic experience. The Accursed Share describes the erotic experience as the expenditure of bioenergy and describes sovereignty with reference to the general economy of life. Bataille’s economy of living being takes its departure from an understanding of the body as part of the global flow of energy and offers a reflection on the ontological significance of the erotic experience.

In Agamben’s lucid analysis of the birth of the polis (that is, how the abstract figure of the biological body is produced and deployed), we are struck by the fact that he did not see the vehement conviction with which the man- son believes himself to be different from the body that delivered him into the world—a body identified with a “lower” nature, with animality, and, consequently, a body understood as the very depository of its own material heritage is imbricated with and mis- taken for the process of socialization. “But it is in darkness, and as darkness itself, that the body was con- ceiv…",

In this contribution, Joshua Schuster interrogates Malabou’s critique of Derrida, concluding that we must necessarily think of some limit in order for deconstruction to not become a kind of automatic work, a calculated system guaranteed in advance. Examining the problems of extinction and biodiversity, and referencing the work of Charles Darwin, Schuster challenges Malabou’s characterization of deconstruction and the adequacy of her concept of plasticity to capture and characterize biohistorical life.

Feminist philosophers demonstrate the need to bring together phenomenological and poststructuralist approaches to embodiment in order to account for the body’s agency and experience, as well as the way the body is subjected to systems of power and domination. Merleau-Ponty and the lived body As I noted earlier, the term ­embodiment – ­the body’s lived ­experience – ­came to prominence during the 1990s. Much of this scholarship drew on the work of Maurice Merleau-­Ponty, including his concepts of the lived body, being-­in-­the-­world, and flesh, a perceptual substance uniting the embodied subject with the world. These aspects of his thinking foil the division between subject and object, thus challenging the dualistic nature of representation. Throughout different stages in his thinking,",

The divine as Ungrund implies not only negation or a Divine Abyss, but the divine as indifferent to the human.

The rift between the aural and the visual tracks in the ﬁlm’s ﬁrst part suggests a gap between two formal logics that are suspended and made incongru- ous throughout the ﬁlm.

He continues: The author is a modern figure, a product of our society insofar as, emerging from the Middle Ages with English empiricism, French rationalism and the personal faith of the Reformation, it discovered the prestige of the individual, of, as it is more nobly put, the “human person”. It is thus logical that in literature it should be this positivism, the epitome and culmination of capitalist ideology, which has attached the greatest importance to the “person” of the author.

This is a crucial insight of which most contemporary feminist theorists seem to have lost sight.

Yet, such assumptions are rarely made explicit or speciﬁ ed. Unfortunately, Grosz follows up this theme of how to make sense of the relation between bodily natures and social construction only in very general terms, where the prime concern is to challenge notions of nature as some kind of ‘timeless,",

I distinguish three shapes of the other: the horizon or 'God', the other person of different sex, and the other person of the same sex. As these figurations of otherness are also distinguished by Luce Irigaray, my discussion of the fertility of the encounter with these figures of alterity is developed in and through my reading of Luce Irigaray's thoughts. Although these figurations of otherness differ considerably, their common characteristic is their transcendence to the female subject. This transcendence, which is a radical immanent transcendence, is characterized by the fact that these others are unsurmountably different. The",

At a certain point, it seemed that feminists were talking past one another, quarreling about something that was in any case an accomplished fact and hardly the result of anyone’s deliberate choice. The view that the collapse of women as a uniﬁed category was the fault of “poststructuralist” feminist theorists and to a lesser extent “women of color” struck me as an attempt to kill the message by killing the messen- ger. It also seemed like a troubling displacement of feminist politics itself. If we no longer speak unthinkingly of women as a group with com- mon interests based on a common identity, surely that is not attributable solely nor even primarily to the considerable critical energies of third- wave thinkers like Judith Butler, Chantal Mouffe, or Joan Scott.

In a series of books, most of which have been recently translated into En glish, she has pio- neered a distinctive mode of reading the Continental philosophical tra- dition, revealing a new materialism that survives and brings to restored relevance Hegel, Heidegger, Derrida, Irigaray, Deleuze, Foucault, and Freud, among others. Traversing the philosophical groundwork of these thinkers, Malabou uncovers and exposes elements of their work that metabolize and metamorphosize concepts and logics that otherwise ap- pear to be unmoving, if not static.

This erotic strain in the verse of Byron, Shelley, and Keats has been variously deplored, condescended to, and set aside by a great many critics, particularly on the grounds that such work lacks the highest sort of artistic seriousness. But Shelley's comments on the erotic poe- try of the Hellenistic and late Roman periods offers a much finer basis for a critical assessment: It is not what the erotic writers have, but what they have ^ not, in which their imperfection consists. It is not inasmuch as they were Poets, but inasmuch as they were not Poets, that they can be considered with any plausi- bility as connected with the corruption of their age.

Crucially, this shift from object to text, from inherent meaning to differential sign, is also a shift away from historical and structural questions of location and formation, towards the noting of the text’s dispersal and dissem- ination along ‘coded paths’.4 Finally, Barthes argues that he will not bring structural and textual analysis into confrontation in his essay, neither will he produce any results or a methodology that can be followed by others: instead, he merely proceeds. What follows this series of disclaimers is an exemplary structural and textual analysis that also breaks new ground, not only constantly pushing at the boundaries of the semiological approach (see below), but also resisting the mastery",

For that reason, one suspects it is precisely this longing that is acted out in the transvestite performance: the repudiated (foreclosed) identification with the opposite sex/gender. As acting out, this performance in turn points to the problem of the unacknowledged, unmourned loss. The transvestite performance incorporates this loss and takes the place of the grief.

As always, our monsters are not monstrous in their alien otherness, but in their sameness and the masturbating serial killer of much contemporary cinema is not so much ‘exceptional’ as an ‘extreme’ reflection and metaphor of a more general anxiety regarding the autonomy of the lone individual of both modernity and the market economy. That such representations of masturbation eschew the possibility of presenting masturbation as a cost-free, exploitation-free form of sexual pleasure a…",

She calls herself “Lotus pensif,” when the name “Coeur brisé” is already taken by another member (Enquêtes, 1: 979), but continues to introduce herself by her own name because she finds the pseudonym does not suit her. In the second chapter of her first récit, Hélène puts herself in danger by going to a “modeling agency” that recruits members of Gil Andréa’s fan club for its prostitution ring servicing Argentina.

What this correspondence allows is an elision of the body-of-the-hands which can be reversed at will and the reversibility of the specular body. In other words, the reflexivity of ‘first vision’ or the flesh of seeing rests on a body which, by virtue of its being able to feel itself in its dehiscence, can see itself in the difference between seeing and being seen.

The extent of this influence is neglected by those who quite commonly say that it is principally literary critics who have adapted to and adopted his work. But the undeniable interest students of literature have taken in his work can throw light on the nature of the arguments Derrida mounts.

While Levinas investigates the ethical injunction from which justice and the focus on the third party arise, Derrida excavates the paradoxes implicit in relating ethics to justice in The Gift of Death (1995b), noting, “I cannot respond to the call, the request, the obligation, or even the love of another without sacrificing the other other, the other others” (1995b, 68).

How is this methodological nominalism reflected in the introduction of the theory of biopolitics? In the first place, we can see it at work in the manner in which Foucault poses the problem of biopolitics, to wit, how did a domain of ‘social life’ come to be constituted as an object for knowledge and as a correlate of certain regulatory practices of power? How did an entity both epistemic and material, such as the ‘population’— possibly the pivotal category of biopolitics—emerge at the intersection of statistical knowledge and epidemiological power?

In order to contextualise my argument, I look to feminist debates about the relationship between women and technology. This is because a study of the posthuman is in many ways an extension of the question of man’s relationship to technology, and accordingly, the status of the human. Throughout this book, the idea of the human (as it has been understood in Western philosophical thought) is questioned.

The philosopher picks up the first item that is about or nearby, such as my blue mug. But as a result of these relatively fixed circumstances characterizing reflection, we encounter qualities not in their changes or transitions, but rather as abiding qualities possessed by an object.

Later, adopting a more poststructural posture, he playfully questions, reverses and transgresses the opposi- tional structures of language and cultural belief by, for example, valoris- ing the romantic and the sentimental – a genre that, though ubiquitous, is often derided as superﬁcial and illusory.

My sketch of these two positions has been a caricature, too brief, too tenden- tious, to carry conviction although it may illuminate central elem- ents of the work of distinguished philosophers. This will become evident as soon as we criticize these stereotypes. Against the com- munitarian we must insist that h…",

Chapter 3 concludes by addressing a competing inter- pretation of Derrida and Freud with respect to these issues advanced by Martin Hägglund. My account shows that the exposure to radical destruction figured in Derrida’s activation of the death drive stems from a structure more primor- dial than simply an opening to the unpredictable future, as Hägglund con- ceptualizes it.

Braidotti’s and Cavarero’s use of the terms ‘ontology’ and ‘essentialism’ needs to be evaluated because basically they are subsuming them within their own political categories. Irigaray, however, has other ideas in mind. She hearkens back, as do most romantic theorists of myth, to a time of origins, and the values that are subsequently invoked, in the name of tradition, are inherently conservative.40 Irigaray reinforces the idea that, when patriarchy did supersede gynocracy, it appropriated its values and manipulated them to suit its own ends. For Irigaray, it is now time to reinstate these gynocratic ideals. There is no explicit reference in either Braidotti or Cavarero to Irigaray’s mythic claims where she introduces these attributes of the ‘feminine’. For this reason, I do find Braidotti and Cavarero somewhat selective in their usage of the",

As Grosz explains: As production, desire does not provide blueprints, models, ideals, or goals. Rather, it experiments, it makes: it is fundamentally aleatory, inventive. Such a theory cannot but be of interest for feminist theory insofar as women are the traditional repositories of the lack consti- tutive of desire and insofar as the oppositions between presence and absence, between reality and fantasy, have conventionally constrained women to occupy the place of men’s other.

It takes all the institutions and values of a repressive order to pacify the bad conscience of this guilt.

The abject is “the place where meaning collapses” and it must be “radically excluded” (Kristeva 1982: 2). Creed emphasizes that the concept of border is crucial in horror as monsters represent the abject by crossing fundamental borders between self/other, life/death, human/nonhuman, and so on. Kristeva ties the abject to the female body and to the mother. For her, “[t]he clean and proper body” of the patriarchal symbolic order must not show any of its “debt to nature,” to bodily fluids or anatomical functions. As the female",

One way of reading these movements is as an attempt to infuse social life and practices with the magic ingredient called form. Whereas Adorno identified this with the tensions contained within the modernist artwork and saw the latter as a site of resistance to the retrograde tendencies of modern culture, Benjamin argued that aesthetic interventions could burst into social space and impact upon the direction of historical devel­ opment. In Benjamin's analysis the artwork has aura, which is a cultic property it inherits from ritual and sacred objects.

In stating this, I am aware that to propose to use a model of only four types of thought styles for the analysis of power relations may invite an immediate resistance, if not charges of determinism and reductionism. In fact, these charges have been raised and adequately addressed in the three decades of interdis- ciplinary application of this model.

This conditional force of nature means that we cannot create any kind of feminist future, for instance one in which we are liberated from sexuality or from needing other human beings. This should not, however, be that disheartening, since the freedom we seek would not make much sense if it were not in accord with our human natures. It is a pity, therefore, that the theorists of the emerging naturalist turn, who admirably break so many other ingrained taboos, seem anxious to face the limiting force that nature exerts on our feminist projects.

Since the early days of feminism’s Second Wave, ‘gender’ had been understood as a construct where preferred forms of feminin- ity and masculinity were endorsed by social and ideological sanctions on abnormality in behaviours and attitudes. By the 1990s femi- nist critics were heeding Judith Butler’s advice to consider ‘[w]hat new shape of politics emerges when identity as a common ground no longer constrains the discourse on feminist politics’ (Butler, 1990: ix). Butler raised fundamental questions about what we are talking about when we discuss gender and identity, and her description of gender as performative, a constant re-enactment (or resistance) of dominant patriarchal para- digms, underscores her argument that ‘if there is something right in Beauvoir’s claim that one is not born, but rather becomes a woman, it follows that woman itself is a term",

That dissent is largely couched in terms which approach the question in ways that do, however, accept her observation of spectatorial nervousness about the gazing transaction when the object is male. The key word is 'disavowal'. This term indicates the means by which the reluctance of the male or 'masculinised' gazer to con- front his (or 'his') gaze and its object is recognised but yet dealt with.

I agree that the transformation of the wound into an identity is problem- atic. One of the reasons that it is problematic is precisely because of its fetishism: the transformation of the wound into an identity cuts the wound off from a history of ‘getting hurt’ or injured. It turns the wound into some- thing that simply ‘is’ rather than something that has happened in time and space. The fetishisation of the wound as a sign of identity is crucial to ‘tes- timonial culture’ (Ahmed and Stacey 2001), in which narratives of pain and injury have proliferated.

As I have sought to show, Bhaskar’s framework does not contradict theories such as Jónasdóttir’s; still, I believe it may appear to do so to many readers and to this extent there is a need for further efforts to theorize the often painfully experienced relation between the damaging and beneﬁ cial aspects of women’s loving. In this chapter I have initiated such a bridging endeavour. By reconciling Bhaskar’s non- dualistic view of love with Jónasdóttir’s concept of love as an exploitable power, by means of Bhaskar’s general meta-theoretical framework, I have sought to offer a more integrated account of the unintegrated forms of love that dominate our",

This is because love is an orientation to thinking and doing, rather than being a particular subset of activities observable as love. The basis of this approach to love, for influ- ential black feminist scholar bell hooks, is resistance to domination. In All About Love, hooks follows psychologist M. Scott Peck in defining love as “the will to extend one’s self for the purpose of nurturing one’s own or another’s spiritual growth”.6 Reflecting on issues around sexism and rac- ism within progressive social movements, hooks argues that “[without] an ethic of love shaping the direction of our political vision and our radical aspirations, we are often seduced, in one way or the other, into continued allegiance to systems of domination”.7 Can we provide hospitality to strangers, or make ourselves vulnerable in unfamiliar spaces, without first",

It is hard to ignore the cyclical nature of evil in recent human history, continuing up to today, and at times it seems that the only way we can cope with and respond to the demonization, marginalization, and ultimate slaughter of fellow humans is through a hope for a future where this no longer happens. It is instructive to invoke Agamben’s cynicism regarding theodicy here, in part for its own wisdom and in part to contrast with Ricoeur. For Agamben, theodicy fails in its result in two ways. In the frantic race to acquit God, theodicies inherently fail to even attempt to bring the human mind to understand the horrifying events that necessarily led to a theodicy in the ﬁrst place. Further, the adjudication of God’s innocence overshad- ows the plea for help from the victims.

However, I would also argue that Butler’s assumption that Kristeva’s semiotic is tied to the notion of a pre-discursive maternal ontology is not upheld by Kristeva’s own descriptions of her topography. Even at her most apparently essentialist, when speaking of the semiotic, or theorizing the pre-symbolic maternal “space”, Kristeva always stresses that the semiotic only exists within the terms of the symbolic.

The thinkers who could be loosely described as “new materialists” are far less concerned than the speculative realists are with the particular paradoxes of correlationism. But they also seek to elaborate new ways of grasping the world, outside of anthropocentric paradigms and grounded in a firm commitment to realism (for a survey of the various new materialisms, see Coole and Frost 2010 and Dolphijn and van der Tuin 2012). Most of the new materialists are strongly influenced (as Graham Harman is also) by the work of Bruno Latour. They take inspiration from the way that Latour traces the power struggles and negotiations of nonhuman as well as human actants (Latour 1988, 151–238) and envisions a world of proliferating hybrids (Latour 1993, 1–3 and passim). Thus Jane Bennett champions a “vital materialism” in which things exhibit “a positive, productive power of their own” (2010, 1 and passim). Rosi Braidotti similarly explores the",

And how does the category of “sex” figure within such a relationship?’ (Butler 1993: 1). In a reading similar to the gap found in castration, Butler argues that the body is to be found in its misrecognition within a symbolic structure: The linguistic categories that are understood to ‘denote’ the materiality of the body are themselves troubled by a referent that is never fully or permanently resolved or contained in any given signified. Indeed, that referent persists only as a kind of absence or loss, that which language does not capture, but, instead, that which impels language repeatedly to",

Tsanoff cites a terse reflection set down by the German philosopher Julius Bahnsen in 18471 when he was seventeen years old. \"Man is a self-conscious Nothing,\" wrote Bahnsen. Whether one considers these words to be juvenile or precocious, they belong to an an­ cient tradition of scorn for our species and its aspirations. All the same, the reigning sentiments on the human venture nor­ mally fall between qualified approval and loud-mouthed brag­ gadocio. As a rule, anyone desirous of an audience, or even a place in society, might profit from the following motto: \"If you can't say something positive about humanity, then say some­ thing equivocal.\" Returning to Bahnsen, he grew up to become a philosopher who not only had nothing either positive or equivocal to say about humanity, but who al…",

The ethical task at hand ­here is to cultivate the ability to discern nonhuman vitality, to become perceptually open to it.

I see Sandra Bullock or Denzel Washington acting in a specific way, and I model myself on them. The filmic screen functions like a mirror. This enables me to gain the illusion of subjectivity and the sense of belonging that comes with that subjectivity. For Lacan, the subject misrecognizes itself in the form of an ego through the mirror stage, and in this sense, the mirror stage represents a turn away from subjectivity rather than the constitution of it. But for Screen theory, the outcome of the mirror stage is not the ego but the subject that conceives itself as the master of what it sees. The difference is not simply",

This move comes at the expense of considering the uniqueness of each voice. For Cavarero, the ‘more that the voice turns out to be a question worthy of inquiry, the more the usual deafness with respect to singular voices appears surprising’ (2005: 12). Yet like music, the human voice is readily emotive and engaging and its recuperation by philosophy once again might lead us to consider the minority stakes in sound, beyond those qualities of music and voice that are so pleasing to the ear. In tackling noise, I depart from this investment in voice, or what Chion called the ‘verbocentrism’ of cinema, to expand beyond the categories of what is even understood as constitut- ing voice to consider murmurs and susurrations that have been traditionally excluded from this category.

His Discipline and Punish,26 has been widely influential, spreading the suspicion that democratic freedom was a ploy to mask the processes of surveillance and disciplining entailed by new forms of knowledge and control of human beings. Sociologists devoted their attention to surveillance and viewed, à la Foucault, freedom as a liberal illusion, undergirded by a powerful system of discipline and control. In that sense, freedom as such was a less interesting object of study than the illusion of subjectivity that freedom creates. Yet, at the end of his life, in his Cours at the Collège de France, Foucault increasingly paid attention to the relationship between freedom and governmentality, that is, to the ways in which the idea of freedom in the market had redefined, in his words, a field of action.27 My book",

As this paradigmatic case demonstrates, Kittler’s analyses of media, which are conceptually based on his understanding of the relation of writing and language, concern precisely their representational qualities—qualities that are ultimately measured against the standard set by unmediated reality itself. Within the theoretical framework of Kittler’s media studies, represen- tation by media aims at the ‘direct’ or undistorted presentation of reality, of making physical reality present to human senses or, in Heideggerean terms, of ‘presencing’ it. The promise of media, hence, is the faithful sensing of the world, a promise given ﬁrst and kept best, in Kittler’s mind, by the ancient technology of alphabetic letters: ‘In the Greek alphabet our senses were present.’¹¹³ Accordingly, Kittler portrays Pre-",

There is a third way, however, in which we can employ Deleuze’s philosophy to expand sexual pleasure by disabling its dominant stratifications, that is inclusive of the orgasm. With the help of a radical politics of disability we can develop sexuality to include what Deleuze would describe as a trem- bling or stuttering, a discontinuation of the false unity and continuity of bodies. Combining a theory of disability with what Deleuze and Guattari theorise as a minor literature we can construct a fruitful way of disabling sexuality as a major concept. A minor literature affects language ‘with a high coefficient of deterritorialization’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1986: 16). This is a writing that does not have to emerge from a minor language, but it does appropriate a major language and puts it to use through deterritorialisations.

Yet difference is at the very basis of life and is there to be enjoyed. And the goal is to open it from the binary to multiplicity, and further, to take it out of a restricted economy. Difference confounds oppositional terms and opens to play and movement. Sexual difference is detrimental only when it is thought from within masculine parameters, within the same discourse that, as history shows, favoured expansionism, colonialism and possessive annexation of woman.

This truth can be summarized by saying that art is confined to the finitude of a subject that knows what it does not know and does not know what it knows. Art recognizes this irony; consequently one purpose of aesthetics is to understand art's value as only approximating an harmonious truth. The true object of aesthetics, then, is the predilection for unexpected culminations. How art is to be interpreted if there are no permanent canons by which to judge it is the question that must be answered. The danger, the great temptation of postmodern aesthetics, is to culminate in sociology, just as Hegel's ethical philosophy was said to dissolve into sociology. 15 Sontag's insistence on \"banning\" interpretation is therefore understandable, but unacceptable.

This anxiety over the eclipse of your looks is exhaustivelycatered to (and, in the process, mag- niﬁed) yet is itself a dread scarcely mentioned. A culture so tolerant and encouraging of public vanity remains strikingly silent on the question of the fear underlying it.

In arguing this point, he is countering a classical conception of what cinematographic images are. We know that the process of cinema projection—in the analogue era and also in the digital age—is one in which a series of still images is projected at such a rapid rate (twenty- four frames per second) that viewers of those images perceive them as being in movement. Thus, a standard account of cinema will claim that in reality cinema’s images are static: they do not move. The only reason they appear to move is because our perceptual faculties are tricked into seeing movement where in reality there is no such thing. From this perspective, therefore, movement is not part of the image but is merely added to the image, almost as a k…",

This also explains my anachronistic use of Foucault’s later texts, which in fact were only published after Barthes’ death, but are nevertheless indispensable to clarify the ethical stakes of Barthes’ phantasmatic literary theory. Le Plaisir du texte (1973) (The Pleasure of the Text) is the first important text in the extension of Barthes’ literary theory. The pleasure from the title refers in the first place to the reader’s pleasure, which surfaces every time one bumps into what Barthes calls the bê- tise (stupidity): a stubborn enjoyment that unconsciously guides the reading process and transports the reader away from that other bêtise,",

Remarkably, we can articulate the link between alterity and violence by following passages in Levinas's own texts. For example, some of the most fascinating pages in Totality and lnfinity demonstrate that it is mortality that exposes being to a constitutive alterity.

If, as Kristeva suggests, the abject collapses conventional delinea- tions, therefore threatening the contained self, it seems logical that Houdini might envisage regaining “control” of his experiences in Egypt by placing them in an established Western fictional model. In Powers of Horror, Kristeva proposes that the process of writing is integral to purging what is thought of as abject: “Writing then implies an abil- ity to imagine the abject, that is, to see oneself in its place and to thrust it aside only by means of the displacements of verbal play” (16). The writer is able to externalize what he or she considers abject by creating objects of repulsion in the text that can then be dealt with in a more considered and effectual manner.

Deleuze locates the emergence of the time-image in Italian neorealism in particular: in films such as Germany, Year Zero (Roberto Rossellini, 1948), characters drift among the ruins of the postwar city; unable to act, they can only bear witness to the lack of political alternatives – ‘[t]his is a cinema of the seer and no longer of the agent’.59 In the animal films that I discuss here, particularly in relation to the biopolitical regimes that they explore, there is also a striking lack of agency at stake – an absence of political alternatives for the animals onscreen, to which an often delayed, directionless aesthetic seems to bear witness. Yet at the same time, for Deleuze, drawing on Henri Bergson’s model of the perpetual split- ting of time, such a ‘direct’ presentation of ‘time itself, pure virtuality’60 opens onto realms of becomings, to that which is yet to be actualised (as I discuss",

The narrowness of Lacanian film theory manifested itself chiefly in two ways: in the way that film theory appropriated Lacanian psychoanalysis and in the way that film theory approached cinematic experience. Let us look at each of these in detail. AN IMAGINARY LACAN Film theory’s understanding of Lacan was largely mistaken.

Serres takes the principle of parasitism in new and interesting direc- tions.

In ‘Grace and Innocence’ (1992), Cixous’ subject of innocence is one who has a speciﬁc relationship to time. In proposing that the issue of the Fall is not one that concerns knowledge per se, but rather a way of living knowledge, Cixous privileges a relationship to subjectivity that approximates something like a non- self-present present. Developing her earlier work in ‘Sorties’, she suggests that in a feminine relation to self-possession – a relation that is actually marked by the dispossession of self-possession – can be found a different way of thinking of the subject who knows it knows, i.e., a different way of thinking about the subject that was inaugurated in the Fall. The subject of a ‘second innoc…",

Pho- tography, she maintains, has inaugurated a new era of inauthenticity in human experience. She is particularly disturbed that photographs can overwhelm view- ers emotionally. There is a great danger, she warns, that when compassion is exhausted or unmoored from the real, ethical action will be thwarted, if not ren- dered impossible.

Helene Rouch, interviewed by Luce Irigaray (1992), points out that mother/child relations through the placenta, which are presented in the imaginary as a fusion, are in fact “strangely ordered and respect- ful of the lives of both”. Viewing these concepts in metaphoric terms, we could say that the placenta is then more a mediating and regulating system than an element of fusion and lack of differen- tiation. This also generates the question as to whether separation is an exclusively traumatic condition or whether it includes a pleasurable element. These ideas are aimed at recognizing the symbolizing, creative capacities in the mother-child space: a concept of a maternity able to promote the child’s autonomy and separation, which aims to establish the bases of a symbolic,…",

Alfonso only suggested that it could be improved. I will argue that Alfonso was less harmless than we think.

Haraway, 1997, p. 7). But this is not inevitable, for the cyborg is deeply implicated in this New World Order, perhaps sometimes even an accomplice. Thus, Haraway writes on the edge, at once practising a paranoia that the New World Order colonizes and constitutes everything, and elaborating a denial of this omnipotence, unravelling those loci when and where the confluences of the New World Order are transfigured, diffracted (for a reﬂection upon her sometime ‘pessimism’, see Harvey and Haraway, 1995). 30 Reconnecting culture, technology and nature",

John Rajchman opens this section with a philosophical overview of how Deleuze’s concep- tion of the cinematic has changed our contemporary views of art. How, Rajchman asks, does the time-image lead to new thinking about figure and narration, violence and memory, image and reality, fiction and documentary, movement and time? How does it form part of a larger “interference” among many arts and disciplines not based in a medium or modernism (or their “posts”) and yet opposed to the pres- ent of information?

We need a way to talk about these bodies and the materiality they inhabit.”28 They also articulate what has since become a hallmark of material ecocrit- icism: “nature is agentic— it acts, and those actions have consequences for both the human and nonhuman world.”29 Ecocritics, long attentive to the literary and cultural enunciations of ecological thinking, were primed to recognize and elaborate such claims about agentic natures.

Performativity upsets these norms, sometimes appropriating them in a transformed fashion, at other times parodying or miming them in a way that draws out their salient elements for criti- cism. The “ontological effects” to which Butler refers are all that we can see or know of “true” gender or sexual identity, a situation dramatized most clearly in drag and other forms of transvestism.

In the encounter with openings and limits that I find in Merleau-Ponty’s thought, two issues arise to which I would like to give further attention: (a) how to think not primarily through visibility, and (b) how to abandon a binary structure of thought by understanding the negativity at the center of the chiasm as an opening of multiple entries to the world.

Accordingly, I aim to rethink Irigaray’s later philosophy, by synthesis- ing it with two other currents of thought: Judith Butler’s ‘performative’ theory of gender and the idea of self-differentiating nature articulated within the German tradition of philosophy of nature. Butler’s approach to gender becomes important for my argument because it is strong in the very areas where Irigaray’s later philosophy is most problematic. Butler argues that gender, sex division, and heterosexuality are (in a sense to be explained) culturally produced and can, as cultural arte- facts, be subverted and dismantled.

Despite this, the assumption that desire is an instinctual energy is pervasive in the commentary on Deleuze and Guattari’s work. This problem is compounded by Deleuze and Guattari’s classification of desire as a flow, which makes it seem that it is struc­ turally comparable to all other flows, such as the flows of capital, money, people and resources. This renders it undifferentiated at the level of both form and content, effectively turning it into a literally empty signifier. The poetic nature of Deleuze and Guattari’s writing style is at least partly to blame for this misper­ ception, in that it obscures the derivation of their concepts behind a bewildering screen of artistic, clinical, literary and philosophical ‘voices’, making it very difficult to see just how their formulations are constructed.

Both Deleuze and Kristeva, she argues, were united in acknowledging that ‘woman’ could not be appealed to as the simple other of ‘man’, and that feminism might then not be one movement among others but a new way of thinking movements or becoming: no longer a movement ‘owned’ by identi- ties, but a movement of desires, bodies, flows and style. For Driscoll, then, becoming is not the becoming of woman, but a becoming that exceeds the dual identities of man and woman, hence the significance of Woolf’s androgyny. Dorothea Olkowski’s interrogation of Deleuze, woman and becoming also sets off from the feminist corpus. This time the negotiation is through Luce Irigaray. If Deleuze presents the horror of a loss of identity to the feminist movement, then Irigaray seems to present the other ex…",

For Deleuze, the virtual is linked to what he refers to as the ‘‘time-image.’’ The time-image gives a direct image of time and therefore di√ers from what he refers to as ‘‘the movement-image,’’ the most important variant of which is ‘‘the action-image.’’ The action-image is ﬁxed to the movement of a hu- man ‘‘sensory-motor schema,’’ which ﬁxes time to the unfolding movement of a linear narrative, typical of classical cinematic representation. Unlike the movement-image, the time-image is no longer deployed to make something seen or to make a viewer see something. It is not a matter of representation, but rather a matter of images moving in conjunction with each other at di√erent angles and speeds. The time-image makes time visible in its own movement and without appearing as a movement aberrant to narrative.≤∑ As such, the time-image points to the productivity of time, the movement of time outside",

The final section of the chapter will examine in detail how Deleuze’s camera consciousness challenges some of the fundamental aspects of the cinematic apparatus and connects with the viewer in new ways. Deleuze’s focus on cinema’s qualities of movement and temporality also offers a very different idea of transcendence and the transcendental subject from that proposed by theorists of the cinematic apparatus. His notion of transcendental empiricism is based on experimentation, on change, and is open to the new. It takes into account sensations and the materiality of life.

The cyborg figures an identity that is neither simply chosen nor entirely determined by others. Haraway therefore suggests that the coalitional grouping ‘women of color,’ as ‘a name contested at its origins by those whom it would incorporate,’ might also ‘be understood as a cyborg identity,’ while Arthur and Marilouise Kroker can make the more sweeping assertion that ‘women’s bodies have always been postmodern.’21 But as the Krokers indicate, these histories of forced signification were in place long before postmodernism became a",

As a means of recommending manners and morals to their readers, both of these courtesy books relate the adventures of two elegant young men, Euphues and Philautus, whose coming of age Lyly depicts as an ongoing encounter with temptation in the form oflove and desire. In the indiscriminate, capricious fickleness of most of the female characters and the continually wrongheaded, hopelessly infatuated state of Philautus, Lyly depicts sexual desire as a compulsive, impersonal, and ridiculous passion, which can be understood only as a direct contrast to reason and wisdom. \"What new skirmishes dost thou now feele betweene reason and appetite, loue and wisdom, daunger and desire\" Philautus asks, rhetorically echoing conventional Petrarchan sentiments and antitheses. All in all we are expected to perceive that \"the desease of loue . . . is impatient, the desire extream…",

Cavell speaks about these issues more or less overtly from a Freudian perspective, while Kristeva critically engages with the Freudian legacy on gender, self, and language. Thus, it is not surprising to ﬁnd that both authors operate within similar frameworks of gender. At the same time, a look at how Kristeva negotiates explicitly the inherited Freudian conundrum of language and gender will help us understand what is at stake in the skeptic’s fear of the woman.

The speaking being is a subject in process because her identity is never ﬁxed in place; her iden- tity is continuously disrupted by semiotic language’s heterogeneity, polyphony, and polysemy (that is, the many and varied sounds and meanings produced by semiotic language). In Kristeva’s view, the two poles of the speaking being, the semiotic and symbolic, are simultan- eously at work. Even though the symbolic mode is usually more prominent, it would be disastrous for either side to triumph altogether. Someon…",

For Macherey, the structural properties of literary works are interesting in as much as they can be seen to fail to contain the multiplicity of cultural meanings upon which they are necessarily built. In the light of this, Macherey advocated a reading practice which would focus not on the coherence of the text, but rather on its contradictions, its strangenesses and inconsistencies: ‘it can be shown that it is a juxtaposition and conflict of several meanings which produces the radical otherness which shapes the work: this conflict is not resolved or absorbed, but simply displayed’ (Macherey 1978: 84). He argued that if the work of the literary critic was ever to be more than parasitic on the literary text – simply reprising its meaning as though it were",

If cinema, rather than normalising time in such techniques as linear editing, fragments and confuses it, the mind also experiences altered states of time that challenge familiar temporal perceptions. For Deleuze, the interval of the time-image is located in editing, framing, lighting and overlay.

Elaborating an erotics of recent innovative litera- ture implies that we engage in the formal pleasure of its experimentations with signifying techniques and with the materiality of their medium—image, print, sound, page, orthography, and syntax. The enjoyment of these experi- mentations does not lead us away from the practical and political outcomes of literature; they are in fact political forms of expressions. Thus, an erotics of innovative fictions highlights these works’ positive ideas and affects best understood in analogy with erotic experiences. “Erotic” refers here not to sexual arousal but to the “intellectual stimu- lation associated with the brief and unexpected flash of the forbidden, to the sexuality of language,” or as Patrick Fuery puts it, to a “critical moment",

Though Irigaray disparages what she calls the \" 'masculine' games of tropes and tropisms\" (Speculum, 140), she is not without her own favorite tropes, chief among them the figure of metonymy. But before examining the way in which Irigaray deconstructs the predominance of metaphoricity in Western culture and creates a space for metonymy, a brief consideration of what Irigaray actually says about speaking (as) woman is in order.

While committed to extending Husserl’s phenomenological understanding of the body as subject, Merleau-Ponty is critical of the transcendental nature of Husserl’s self-present embodied consciousness.1 In terms of Lyotard’s definition of phenomenology as ‘that which appears to consciousness, that which is given’ (Lyotard, 191: 32), Merleau-Ponty denies consciousness an intentionality which can be divorced from its …",

Like the mother she must be there in order that she may be abjected: in Misery that is the role of woman; she has no other function. There are no positive images of the feminine in this misogynistic text. Annie is particularly dosely associated with the pre-symbolic",

After all, standpoint methodology is not for individual women to ground their thought exclu­ sively in their own specific social locations, nor for women collectively to agree on a single ideal woman’s life from which to begin. The idea is that everyone involved (including but not just men) will contribute to research that at least sometimes starts from lives that are different from our own. This is not necessarily a cause for skeptical concern, as Uma Narayan explains. “Our commitment to the contextual nature of knowledge does not require us to claim that those who do not inhabit these contexts can never have any knowledge of them” (2003, 314).

He asks if Bergson’s use of “multiplicity” is a “barely nominalized adjec- tive” or a “substantive” and what difference it makes. For example, in Time and Free Will, Bergson argues that numerical multiplicity is the multiplicity of homogeneous units juxtaposed in the homogeneous medium of ideal space. This is why we disregard qualitative differences and common features when we count and instead treat objects as homogeneous units qualitatively identi- cal to one another.98 It is, on this account, entirely and only their juxtaposition in space that makes these units at all diverse and distinguishable.99 This can be differentiated from listening to a melody and retaining the sounds in memory without counting them.

Lovemaking is a powerful experience, the most convulsive emotional and physical drama in most people’s lives. And it warrants as much artful attention from film auteurs as space operas or teen revenge fantasies.” Corliss, “In Defense of Dirty Movies,” 74. 2 Susan Sontag’s groundbreaking essay, “The Pornographic Imagination,” which discusses only pornographic literature, not film, is helpful on this point. Sontag argues that literary pornography’s aim of inducing sexual excitement is not at odds with supposedly more “detached involvement” evoked by genuine art. She points out that many certified masterpieces from Geoffrey Chaucer to D. H. Lawrence have excited readers sexually and that many other works of literary por- nography—Story of O, Story of the Eye, The Image—mix art and arousal. Sontag,",

Certainly one would not have to look far to see a critique of the patriarchy in “Obedient Love of Woman Her High- est Bliss”: it so starkly represents the violence of romantic ideologies that it could be read as an exposé of them. Such a reading might appeal to feminist critics because it would seem to consolidate a legacy of writing by morally superior women who are indignant at the brutality inﬂicted upon them yet capable only of subversive resistance. But to ﬁnd in such works only a powerless critique of patriarchal bru- tality is to create a false picture of the trajectory of American literary history.

She uses a metaphor of the wartime blocks of margarine that were dull and pale but came with a pellet of golden colour that you worked through the block until it infused the whole thing bright yellow. She says that the erotic can be like that in our lives, making the whole thing more vibrant. We can allow the erotic to permeate our lives way beyond obviously sexual experiences, to everything that we do, whether that is building a bookcase or writing a poem (see Barker, 2017).

Cioran takes up this thread from other thinkers to be sure—Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Lich- tenberg, Leopardi, Pascal, the French moralists.

Where the texts of Jacques Derrida and Jacques Lacan have been a mainstay of feminist theories of subjectivity for several decades, welcoming receptions of Deleuze’s philosophy have been few and far apart. The reasons for this fact may be attributed to geography: Derrida and Paul de Man were the subject of intense scrutiny in the development of the ‘Yale School’ of deconstruction in the 1970s that located the ori- gins of sexual difference in enunciation. As utterers of inherited idioms, they argued, we quickly discover that language tends to mold our identity before we have anything to say about it. Only by working into an actively performative relation with language do we, as ‘subjects’, begin to alter its formative effects. The Yale School gained renown as a site where F…",

From its ﬁ rst, discreet appearance in his lexicon in the context of a discussion about social medicine, through to its highly condensed theoretical elaboration in a few dazzling pages of the ﬁ rst volume of his History of Sexuality and beyond, Foucault’s concept has assumed such contemporary purchase that it has even been suggested that the entire framework of political philosophy has emerged profoundly modiﬁ ed in its wake. What did Foucault intend by this term? On a simple, diagnostic level, he sought to account for the process by which, starting from the advent of modernity, the very natural life of the living individual (and, by extension, the biological existence of the human species) began to be integrated, with ever-increasing urgency, into the techniques and strategies of a political power bent on optimising the productive forces of life itself.

In a double negation of self and world, and of world and world, which is to say, to follow Thacker, a negation of the for-us and the in-itself, Cioran offers a critique of consciousness from the perspective of “individual and cosmic loneliness”: One can experience loneliness in two ways: by feeling lonely in the world or by feeling the loneliness of the world. Individual loneliness is a personal drama. . . . An outcast in the world, indifferent to its being dazzling or dismal, self-consumed with triumphs and failures, en- grossed in inner drama—such is the fate of the solitary.

Many thinkers associated with posthumanism and new materi- alism engage explicitly with Merleau-Ponty, recognising the extent to which their work resonates with a phenomenology of embodi- ment. Astrida Niemans, for instance, proposes a ‘posthuman phe- nomenology’ that extends the experience of embodiment beyond subjectivised humans to other bodies, for instance ‘bodies’ of water (2017: 23–4).

That is to say, it must exceed any relational effect that it has on other portions of the world, given its independence from any particular effects it might have in the world at large. This is the ambivalence described earlier: although an assemblage is formed from components in relation, it is an emergence that exceeds those components. And along with exceeding the reality of its parts, it is also deeper than any outer effects it might have, and might not have any effects at all while still retaining its reality.

If the territory was initiated by an architectural statement, then the developing of this statement forms the basis of “style” (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 317). For Deleuze and Guattari, the transition from signature to style is not sim- ply a question of scale: from one expressive quality to an aggregate of multiple expressive qualities.

The visual dynamics described in “Visual Plea­sure and Narrative Cinema” have been widely applied not only to film but to other media as well, including photogra- phy, advertising, painting, and tele­vi­sion, making this essay a landmark text for visual culture and media studies generally. But Mulvey’s description of the male gaze has not been without its critics—­feminists included—­who have pointed out limitations. For many, the spatial logic of the male gaze limits the ways in which vision (and visual plea­sure) can be understood. Because the masculine gaze is always posited as the site of mastery and control, while the feminine is marked by submission to the gaze, little room is left within mainstream narrative cinema for re­sis­tances or alternative prac- tices.

Biological science reduces to a matter of physiology, psychoanalysis to a matter of unconscious drives, and Marxism to a matter of economics a subordination which is in fact socially and culturally produced. As such, it is capable of being changed if women can grasp the subjecthood they have been so far denied. De Beauvoir’s conclusion, then, is a mixture of optimism and exhortation. Economic self- interest, she writes, has led men to give partial social and economic emancipation to women. Women must now seize this opportunity to achieve complete economic and social equality. This done, an ‘inner metamorphosis’ will follow. Woman will exist for herself: she will be a Subject as man is a Subject, an Other for him only so far as he is for her. Second wave feminism 29",

Diogenes in Deleuze (1990a: 130) The feminist critique of the economy of representation has questioned the identiﬁcation of sexual difference with sexual reproduction, the analogy between biology and culture. This identiﬁcation assigns sexual difference to a negative regime of presence and absence, full and void, abundance and lack. In her work, Luce Irigaray questions the economy of representation founded on the transcendent conception of matter and the binarism of sex.32 In her re-conceptualization of femininity, sex is not determined by the biological form and function of sexual organs, but becomes a ﬂuid dimension of a matter–matrix that is autonomous from the law of ﬁliation.

Against this backdrop, the defiant subject—the subject who opts out of the system—is one who is able and willing to turn away from the promise of happiness (as conceptualized by the normative order). Ahmed asserts that the emergence of such a subject entails becoming aware of “how one’s being has been stolen” (2010, 167). Ahmed presents four figures of rebellion—the feminist killjoy, the unhappy queer, the melancholy migrant, and the radical revolutionary—whose capacity to resist the happiness scripts of the social establishment depends on their ability to desire differently. For instance, in the context of the feminist killjoy, Ahmed revisits Betty Friedan’s unsatis- fied suburban housewife as a figure whose politicization was directly linked to her recognition that the truth of her desire deviated from the happiness script that she was being asked to a…",

Thus, the question that situates the second half of our volume’s ﬁ nal theoretical exploration of women’s creativ- ity is: Is creativity the product of internal conﬂ ict or is it the imag- ination’s method of dealing with external forces imposed upon the individual? This central question focuses the chapters that privilege the Medusa ﬁ gure and Hélène Cixous’s seminal essay “The Laugh of the Medusa.” These chapters employ a number of different theories",

Blanchot believes that death involves a possibility and impossibility: individuals understand death because they experience the loss of another, and are also unable to understand it, because it cannot be consciously apprehended. This can be related to Peter’s desire for a partial “death”. Blanchot is also interested in how the human relationship with death involves a desire to grasp the impossible.

In her seminal text Gender Trouble (1990), Butler seeks to reveal the notion of gender identity, construed as a stable core of the human subject from which behaviour originates, as a regulatory fiction. This fiction is produced by the 'heterosexual matrix', a normative set of discourses prescribing a congruence between sex, gender and (heterosexual) desire.

The narrative also explicitly figures the obsessive surveillance of Madame Beck and the meticulous observations of the ‘‘ghost-seer’’ Lucy as supernatural spectral activities (353). In addition, monomaniacal emotional longings explicitly turn Polly and Lucy into ghostly wraiths (69, 353, 238, 353), and, as mentioned earlier, Lucy describes her fraught economic condition in supernatural terms (107, 112). Indeed, in Villette the ghost motif indicates that the real conditions brought about by capitalist economics are more to be feared than any paranormal events. Right after Lucy sees the nun for the first time, Dr. John remarks that it is a ‘‘spectral illusion . . . resulting from long-continued mental conflict’’ (330).

This line of procedure could be carried out and in many cases continues to be carried out, at an abstract level; for instance, in abstractions about ‘the other’. However, for de Certeau, the direction of this line of analysis is towards its ultimate destination within ‘concrete localizations’. Rather than an endless deferment, deconstruction becomes positivity as the line of argument is made to meet up with ‘pertinent points of impact’. Employing a visual imagination, we could say that a map of the geography of the possible would consist of multiple transparencies which, without any one taking precedence, would allow us to see points of possible contact.

Such a relationship cannot be reduced to a relationship of knowledge, nor can we assume a fundamental equality of being between the participants: God and I.

Indicating the need for further investigation of this specifically female access to love, Kristeva expresses her hope that it may lead to the discovery of an ethics based on a new psychoanalytic understanding of motherhood: a herethics of love ('Stabat Mater'). It is this herethical ethics she finds embodied in psychoanalytic practice: 'If the analyst doesn't love his patients he ought to give up trying to cure them' (Interview in Les Cahiers du GRIF, 32, 1985, p. 21).

For Rosi Braidotti (2003: 43–44), the redefinition of the female subject begins through the bodily roots of subjectivity while emphasizing the po- litical importance of desire and of its role in the constitution of the subject. From this perspective, the subject of feminism is simultaneously sexed and social. Braidotti posits the body, or the embodiment of the subject, as a key term in the feminist struggle for the redefinition of subjectivity. It is to be understood as neither a biological nor a sociological category, but rather as a point of overlap between the physical, the symbolic and the material social conditions (Grosz 1987; Braidotti 1989). Drawing on Braidotti, the counter-images of the Jihadi Bride are utilized as a means to reconfigure the politically informed maps of the present (i.e. cartography). It invokes",

Coverley emphasises temporality but also its clear Derridean link to limitrophy and deconstructive thinking and interpreta­ tive methodology more generally. ­ 27 Not only the concept of hauntology is haunted, but all concepts are haunted by the inexactitude of available tools of definition, of durable stakes for pinning down.

I intend, in other words, to introduce a comparative perspective of sorts, not so much to present a simple analogy as to flag up the possible limits of visual opacity. If a vital purpose of the perceptually opaque is to provoke, to bewilder, and to produce a sense of cognitively fertile turmoil, the state of contain- ment upon which the image is contingent might lessen such effects (and moving images are not much different in this respect, as they, too, are subject to the restraints of the frame).
