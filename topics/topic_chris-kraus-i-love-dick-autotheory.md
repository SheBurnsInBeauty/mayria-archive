consistently make use of the metaphorical power that these images and concepts carry. At the same time, his fictional worlds reflect our own in a tendentious way; they make explicit structures and processes that are implicit in the infrastructure of our present world. By adding the historical continuity of the future to our social institutions he reveals the historical, contingent nature of those institutions. The fictional worlds of his novels contain political analyses that are both highly organized and highly critical. These novels thus increase the importance of the genre by making it a more engaged and historical fictional form. These are large claims. and anyone picking up a Dick novel at random and reading it may wonder at them. The truth of the matter is that Dick's

From January 1852 (when he resolved to discontinue masturbation) until the end of 1858, according to B. R. Burg, he kept a scrupulous record of his sem- inal losses, itemizing ‘all expenditure of semen by date and by immediate cause, recording whether they were involuntary, induced by a partner, or caused by solitary masturbation’ (Burg, An American Seafarer in the Age of Sail: The Erotic Diaries of Philip C.

Jeopardy on the computer. Had to stop scanning cause I didn’t think everyone wanted to see hundreds of images of my dick. I like it though, maybe a little too much. I realized today that making collages in puberty I always looked through magazines for pictures of tits, assses, hot-looking women. No cunts—I was too chicken to be that blatant. Everything I did had to be sup- pressed somehow. Probably made the work better. But now I’m just as turned on by the sight of me, my own dick, my ass (skin- ny as it is) and my piss, shit, or whatever. I get hard looking at myself. Can you believe it? Mr. Auto Erotic. I’m not in love with myself. And it’s not that I think that I’m all that great, it’s just that I see my body for the sexual history it contains—a sexual map—and it gets me going. And then I think about the possi- bilities, where I want to go, like lately I’m thinking about cutting my testicles off before I die—right before I die, when I’m done

But I love the story of how he said “fuck off” to the fascist who tried to push in ahead of him in a Greek bank. He was always a kind, forgiving, and courteous man. A shepherd in Greece and taxi driver in Australia. Forever stopping to assist others and greeting people with a warm smile. Only once did my

Yorker]. I loved a piece he wrote about R Kelly in the New Yorker a while back. I love how damned thorough he is. I was actually reading another piece of his lately, about Bruno Mars, and trying to pinpoint what I love about his writing. SFJ is a musician himself and I think you can tell that in the rhythm of his writing – rhythm is such an important thing for me in writing, and I love the rhythm he has. But also I think it’s a certain precision he has that I admire. He has this obvious vast wealth of knowledge which makes his writing have weight, and seem so unhurried, and his sentences so fi nely-turned. Plenty of music writers can do that, I know, but SFJ marries it to something else – he’ll sud- denly deliver a single line that has a warmth or a humour or a particularly arresting image, or something that just seems very human rather than encyclopaedic. The R Kelly piece w…

even after his recent death, a loud, growling presence in my mind. He is one of the few people to have read a complete draft of this manuscript (despite being ill at the time) and he was, as always, encouraging. Dick, along with my other advisors, Bill Connolly and Jennifer Culbert, are and always will be exemplary. The University Scholars Programme at the National University of Singapore is happily a very nice place to work. The best part is that I get to talk every day to a diverse group of scholars, from theoretical chemists to biosemioticians, anthropologists, rhetoricians, physicists, and liter- ary critics. Thanks to my colleagues, I always get to feel like a beginner, amazed at what there is to know and reminded of my profound ignorance. In particular, I thank Mark Brantner, Donald Favareau, and Peter Vail for their conversation and friendship. Thanks to David and Doris …

his time in the service, a kind of “f8 and be there” sensibility. He liked the work I was doing and gave me a key to the school darkroom, which meant I could go in anytime and print—and I did. Ken Jandel took a chance on a newbie like me and in his ex- marine corpsman style “trained” me into medical photography. God bless him—he had a way with surgeons like I’m sure he had a way with certain master sergeants. Gus Gustafson, the unofficial mayor of St. Paul and the eternal optimist, was the Norman Vincent Peale of photography; whenever I was down about the business, he would say “ah, no problem,” and whenever I had a question about what I would charge for some work he would say “just bill ’em.” Gus out and about was always a good sign. The other eternal optimist was Jim Czarniecki. Interested in what I was up to, he always had new ideas, and he was like that with many artists…

XVI Achwwledgements for me a great source of philosophical and human inspiration through­ out the years. James Traub, whose acute mind and implacable sense of humor made me laugh when laughter was really all I needed. And Brooke Kroeger, the strongest woman I know, whose affection and belief in me I will simply never forget. Among the people to whom I feel most indebted are my editor at the University of Chicago Press, David Brent, and Giuseppe Laterza from Editori Laterza. Their confidence in this book as well as their kindness and friendship have been precious. At the University of Chicago Press I would like to thank Maia Melissa Rigas for her excel­ lent copyediting of the manuscript under extreme circumstances. I owe a lot to Luis Guzman, who did a wonderful job translating my dialogue with Habermas, and Michael Naas and Pascale-Anne Brault, whose rendering of my exchange with Derrida into English is nothing short of a work of art.

he becomes more interesting. What the two misinterpretations miss, from my perspective, is the attractiveness of the death drive. We live in a libido- dominated world in which we share a denial about the death drive. That is capitalism and that is Heidegger’s ‘they’ thinking, but it is not our own thinking, not deep down and authentically. Deep down and authentically, we know the death drive is who we are and who everyone else is as well. As Julie Reshe says, “the darkness of the soul is the only thing we genuinely hold in common. Our internal breakdown, brokenness, malfunction, trag­ edy, and absurdity encounter who we most genuinely are.”48 That is why young Charlie will always love her uncle Charlie because her Uncle Charlie

Finally, William, thank you for understanding the importance of autonomy, independence, and space for how I live, love, and write. Like little kids creating our own shortcuts, I am glad that we’ve stayed away from well-traveled paths. Thank you for ensuring a life-work balance and still playing. Thank you for a creative partnership bound by the aesthetics of funk.

And thank you, Chris Meriam, for supporting me and for understanding so profoundly the depth of my loss of John. I am grateful for your love of me and of John, and we both thank you for the sharing of ideas over the years. John wrote some acknowledgments before his death. He wished to rec- ognize my cousin Gene Parodi and his wife, Bonnie, whose empathic pres- ence during a trip we made together to Italy in 2003 engaged John in sharing himself at increasingly intimate levels. This experience reconnected John to the power and presence of Roberto Assagioli, and this reawakening allowed us to remember that Roberto’s therapeutic presence was essentially about empathic or altruistic love. We made a choice then to place this empathic love, this essence of Roberto, at the center of our book on psy…

New South Wales.

from working with you. But please note that in Dick’s (Zaner) treatment of depth, the depth of being is not primarily that of knowing. If I read our we-relationship rightly, we both have become much deeper in Dick’s existential sense of being. That’s what we mean when we talk about the abundance of being that has come through our we-relationship. JACK: We both have been blessed with abundant being, but in truth, I think in that sense, you have become deeper. ANNE: Do you mean I have become deeper than you? If so, I doubt it, but thanks. Or that I have become deeper than I was? If so, that’s true. JACK: I think you have become deeper than I and much deeper than you were. The existential depth we are talking about has to do with intimacy and affection and the felt sense of how we relate to each other in our world. We constitute our world and thoroughly enjoy living with each other in that …

E-mail. Mark and Jackie. Kevanne. Ed Smith. I start out answer- ing their long unanswered inquiries to me and my replies become long winded recaps of my most recent hellish days. It’s all the on- going saga of “Bob,” even my involvement with friends. No won- der some of them want nothing to do with me. They have their own self-centered sagas and don’t need me and my sorry tales to muck it up. But I don’t really feel that. They’re fucked for not calling, whoever they are.

Del Valle for helping me to set up my first interview with a group of fans. I have learned from conversations about heavy metal and popular cul- ture with many other people, particularly Chris Kachian, Csaba Toth, and Metal Mark of GMS. I thank Gary Thomas and the members of his Gay Studies class for an evening spent discussing heavy metal videos and gender construction. My work has benefited from the ideas and criti- cisms of my students at the University of Michigan, the University of Minnesota, and Dartmouth College, especially those in my Contempo- rary Popular Music Studies course at Michigan. Thanks also to my metal guitar teacher, Jeff Loven, and to the many other rock musicians I have performed with and learned from, especially Gene Retka, Steve Cekalla, James Capra, Dave Michel, John Helgen, and Gregg Ramseth. William Shurk at Bowling Green State University is the knowl…

aperture of pluralistic psychosexual psychotherapy, rather than the single lens of addiction, the more refined our formulation and the more effective our treatment approach will be. In my spare time, I love reading and learning about cosmology. It gives me a sense of awe. I particularly admire the scientists working in that field because they sometimes have to put all their knowledge or assumptions back on the drawing board when they make a new discovery that questions the previous knowledge. I absolutely love the consistent curiosity, the pas- sionate exploration, and the humility of open self-questioning. This is why I love science. I dislike a devout ideology because it is the opposite. People who are devout can literally make anything fit their beliefs and tune out what disagrees with their ideology. I think it is sad. But each to their own. I uphold my love for science by committing myself to re-writing this book

George Dickie, Paul Guyer, Peter Kivy, and the late Irving Thalberg, Jr., read the earliest stages of this project and provided more than ample feedback. Stanley Cavell discussed my debate with Heath with me insightfully, and Ian Jarvie, when I see him, has let me bend his ear mercilessly. My original editor at Columbia, Bill Germano, was immensely enthusi- astic and expeditious. Jennifer Crewe and Joan McQuary have continued in the same spirit. Most of all, I have Sally Banes to thank for sharing her ideas, her life, and her computer with me during the grumpy times in which such books are composed.

Well, what about the flesh tone toys, the pleasure-with-a-feather products, the disco ball of sexual consumerism? I’ve been cynical about the hype surrounding various sex products since before I first got a job working in a vibrator store. But I see the same absurd come- ons in every other part of my life, which is ritually assailed by ad- vertising and ideological propaganda. I’m no more sympathetic to a “revolutionary” laundry detergent or a car “that will change your life” than I am to a “miraculous” set of Ben Wa balls. I don’t find McDonald’s commercials more classy than one for adult videos. I nevertheless love my favorite vibrator the same way I love my favor- ite books, my record albums, and my bicycle with the white tassels on the handlebars. No, if you strip off all the capit…

My greatest gratitude goes to my wife, Rebecca Wittmann, who loves our gravel road as much as I do and, more than this, knows exactly how to write a great book, so was able to help me at every turn. She makes everything possible. I dedicate this to her and to the new bodies that we belong to: Nora Kathryn, who likes to sit on my lap and help me type, and her big brother, Charlie, whose astute questions in my office the other day spurred me finally to finish this book. “Papa, are you writing different stories each day? Or always the same one?”

Anti-­Electra is for the women of the organization Frauenhetz in Vienna who twice invited me to lecture and discuss my ideas about the female child.

Conclusion: what Kathy did 189 testifying to the importance of finding and fostering the women artists and writers who provide us with a secret history of preceding epochs and of oppositional politico-​cultural movements such as the extremist avant-​garde. In a review essay on Chris Kraus, Jenny Turner comments “how much Acker there is curled up inside that book [Chris Kraus’s novel, I Love Dick]” (14). Turner captures here how Acker did change the possibilities for women’s writing. She refused the highly popular realist novel of women’s lives, the influential utopian strand of contemporary women’s experimental writing denoted by écriture féminine, and the more accessible and polished version of women’s postmodern fiction exemplified by Angela Carter and Jeannette Winterson. Rather, she forged a feminist minor literature as a bricoleuse who ‘made do’ with the culture’s treasur…

the first place. I met him when I was a barely formed undergraduate, seek- ing to reconcile a desire to treat my sexuality as both an important and unremarkable center of my identity with a desire to join the tradition of do- ing intellectual combat with capital, which, whatever its intentions, clearly treated homosexuality as outside the arena. Chris was an electrifying, shin- ing example of how to do the two at once. He embodied for me the cutting knowledge of the genius fag in its most vivid, world-­burning force. Early on, he fixed me with wide eyes and recounted the lost universe built by gay liberation, one which held a revolutionary kernel but whose defeat through biopolitical counterinsurgency had left unprocessed trauma among survi- vors and installed a class of ideologues whose function was to justify their betrayal of this past. I had known about this world but not its promise, and I had sensed the deathly energies of its usurpers without knowing what end

Or else, do you see that presenting itself more and more, espe­ cially in texts known as “autotheory” in Anglophone scholarship today (that is, texts that question heterosexual norms in relation to the question of homo-­ or transsexuality of the self and/or the lover)? Here, I am thinking of the beginning of Paul Preciado’s Testo Junkie, the scene where the persona, in the process of chang­ ing her gender, films herself masturbating; or else Maggie Nelson’s Argonauts (inspired by Preciado’s Testo Junkie), which begins with the brief narration of the persona being fucked on the floor by her

write such a survey has been my goal here. As I finish this first description of Dick's entire career as a novelist, I feel sharply its many inadequacies. I wish in particular that I could have made it clearer how funny Dick's novels are, and how important comedy is to his work. But I comfort myself with the certainty that better critics than I will take it from here, so that my mistakes will be corrected, and our understanding of this great artist furthered. And first explorers are often excused their errors, their omissions, their tall tales.

Godzilla, while Scott Michaelsen taught me to appreciate board games and a great deal about critical theory. Most importantly of all, how- ever, I must acknowledge Morgan Shipley and Jack Taylor. In addition to standing by me as incredible friends, and inspiring me to become a better scholar and a better human being, these two individuals shared countless laughs, labored alongside me in journeys through Hegel’s murkiest prose, and as a result I believe that they have made this project far more compelling.

which makes the subject (as, precisely, this symbolic, third place) into a linguistic signifier in a system, which thereby permits him to relate symbolically to other signifiers, that is, at once to relate to other humans and to articulate his own desire, his own uncon- scious, unawares. What, then, is Dick’s story in this conception? Initially, Dick has a separate relation (a relation of projection) to each of his imaginary objects. What Klein does is to articulate the relations of the objects among themselves, Dick being one of the objects in the system: Dick learns to assume himself as such, to assume himself as a signifier. “Dick—little train, Daddy—big train, Dick is going into mummy.” In saying this, Klein takes the relation between Dick and the train and articulates it as a relation between two trains. In this way she introduces Dick into the Symbolic through the con…

the month before. I was on my way out the door for a job interview when the phone rang. It was the publicist at Earache Records, Godflesh’s label at the time. She wanted to know if I knew anyone who could give the guys a ride to their in-store appearance at Cel- lophane Square in the U-district that afternoon before the show that night at the Fenix Underground. I distinctly remember my voice cracking as I said, “I could do that!” All I was thinking during my interview was that I was going to pick up Godflesh right after. I couldn’t remember the ques- tions or my answers as I drove to their hotel in my 1983 Honda Civic hatchback. I was wearing a button-up shirt and a tie, and

you were a hippie, you were obliged to listen to Pink Floyd, who lived up the road. My carpentry teacher knew them and we actually met them on a school visit. Or you listened to Genesis or Led Zeppelin and, because I wanted to be a little bit different and exceptional, I got into German music. I think Tangerine Dream was the ﬁ rst thing I got into and then maybe it was Can and the bands like Neu!, Kraftwerk, Amon Düül II and a whole bunch of others, and people like Klaus Schutze, and it was a whole scene. But I suppose Can and Kraftwerk are the two things that are more important to me because they’ve been threads through subsequent musical history. So you can basically see the inﬂ uence of this track in sort of post-punk material, Public Image, where they were consciously trying to imitate the drum sound, and you know Jah Wobble ended up collaborating with Holger Czukay, t…

My effort in language and in thematics is to break with interdictions and false modesties. This is why I go so willingly into the house of dreams: I admire them for their aptitude for non-discrimination. It is in their house that the equal light from before the guilty feeling reigns. Neither pride, nor shame. It is only in dreams that we are strong and generous enough to look God in the face while he bursts out laughing. That creation, really! Those creatures! It takes some doing! And I also laugh to have caught God doing what he has never done elsewhere. Writing blind: conversation with the donkey 125

66 Fan Phenomena: Supernatural haven’t felt passionate enough about a social issue to make me want to vid about it. Another major source of motivation is working on vids for other peo- ple. I have put myself up for auction a few times (fandomaid) and I find working on a vid that someone else has either provided the idea or the song for is very motivating. I love the challenge of working with some- thing I haven’t thought of. There’s something intrinsically rewarding about knowing you’re making it for someone in particular (and you know at least one person will watch it!). It’s also a great way to connect with fellow fans. Counteragent and I got to know each other after I made her requested Bobby vid (‘Mr. Sandman’).

His work has been translated to the screen by directors with styles as varied as Steven Spielberg (Empire of the Sun, 1987) and David Cronenberg (Crash, 1996). He was interviewed by countless talented writers, including Jon Savage, V. Vale, Will Self, Richard Kadrey, John Gray, Simon Sellars, and Mark Dery. His influence is found in sound from Joy Division, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Sisters of Mercy, K.K. Null, and Gary Numan to Madonna, Radiohead, Trevor Horn, Cadence Weapon, and Danny Brown, as well as the aforementioned Creatures and The Normal. His writing and thinking are broad enough to elude categories and focused enough to remain absolutely singular. His work gerrymanders categorical distinctions, defining and defying its own boundaries as it goes. I think of him in the same way I think of Octavia E. Butler, Ray Bradbury, Thomas Pyn-

Despite his strong aversion to most things grotesque, Howard has built a life with someone who, for the past six years, has thought almost obsessively about the relation- ship between eroticism and excrementality. Howard has also endured my terribly ornery writing moods, many of them prompted by a certain relic- peddling pilgrim. I have promised him that the content of my next project will not be so ﬁ lthy. At this moment, however, I can think of no better way to express how happy Howard makes me, and how much I owe him, than to dedicate this book to him against his wishes.

for them, too. A special thanks to my photographer friends who have joined me on many road trips—Mike Melman, Andy Baugnet, Dan Dennehy, Martin Berg, and Ted Haaland. Mike was on a lot of the trips represented by photographs in this book. He liked early mornings in winter only, and I was just about the only other crazy guy that would get up on a winter morning and make photographs. We were a good match. Ted also merits special thanks: not only is he my brother-in-law but he introduced me to the road trip. We started our road trips together back in the 1980s. I credit Ted with getting me going in a serious way on my personal work. I want to thank others in the fields of fine art and photography who always encouraged me. The endeavor of fine art photography is in special need of encouragement, because truly many are called and few are chosen. Among the chosen are Cheryl Y…

from the other visual arts, since it is not so much constituted by formal characteristics but rather by the psychological condition of narcissism. This psychological state of the self, split (amputation) and doubled (extension) by its mirror reflection, constitutes for Krauss not the subject matter but rather the form, or model, of video.* It is likely that McLuhan’s general alignment of mans (or woman’s) use of media with Narcissus’ experience has fed into Krauss’s assessment of the specific medium of video. There are some crucial points of comparison between the work of the media analyst and that of the art theorist that will prove important for my discussion of American body art and its modes of perception. McLuhan and Krauss focus their accounts on the human body. Media affect the body, and the subject needs to respond psychologically to this physical irritation. Also, both authors react with their texts to the phenomenon

my alias (that’s Creation’s rule. I don’t really think it’s necessary, but I suppose it adds to the mystique. I just wish they’d let me pick my own name. I’m dying to ask a buttoned-up hotel clerk to find a room with a view for ‘Pat McCrotch’). The point is it seems that, at least for now, I’m a regular fixture on the Supernatural Dog n’ Pony show, there to help deliver the experience the fans are hoping to have. I’m the approachable actor, the Kara- oke King, the funny front man, the silly sidekick. And to many of them, I am, for lack of a better word, famous. Who am I to tell them they’re wrong? They’re having fun, I’m having fun. No one is getting hurt (unless there’s another outbreak of karaoke stage-diving or Matt hurls another chair). I just show up and play the part I’m expected to play. Is that weird? Perhaps. But at its core, it’s still just acting. It’s what I do. So maybe sometimes,

many appreciations of Dick written by science fiction writers; others include the ones mentioned earlier by Lem and Brunner, and articles by Ursula K. Le Guin, Thomas Disch, Brian Aldiss, and Ian Watson.) Then R.D. Mullen and Darko Suvin, editors of Science Fiction Studies. organized an issue of that journal devoted entirely to Dick's work. This issue contains a good proportion of the best criticism of Dick written to this day. Included in it is an overview of Dick's career by Suvin, which is perhaps the standard, most influential reading of his career, an evaluation of his opus that all subsequent writers concerned with all of Dick's work must take into account; bibliographical information by Willis McNelly, who was of great help to Dick and who obtained from him his private papers for the library at California State University, Fullerton; important generic analyses by Carlo …

large. Someone on the street even manages to videotape it. And, of course, the third is the penultimate scene, which has been foreshadowed at the Clarendon County Morgue. Using the autopsy saw he purchased at the gun show, Lecter performs a do-it-at-home autopsy on the live body of Krendler (essentially a vivisection), opening his skull in much the same way the pathologist has done, incising through tissue and bone. Detach- ing the skull cap, he exposes the brain, slicing and removing it as if for tis- sue sampling. Interestingly, Lecter is following the early modern proce- dure for autopsying the brain memorialized in Andreas Vesalius’s Fabrica. In the brain illustrations of the Fabrica, Vesalius has made an inci- sion across the forehead of the cadaver just above the eyebrows and around the circumference of the skull, allowing the skull cap to be removed like a lid. The preferred method today of incising over the crown of the skull and
