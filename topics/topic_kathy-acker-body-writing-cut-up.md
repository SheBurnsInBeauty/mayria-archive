in the newspaper. Nadia Battella Gotlib dates what she terms Lispector’s “circu- lation of texts” from the mid-1960s: the beginning of a period of movement of Lispector’s texts among various of her publications in newspapers, magazines, and books: these texts circulate, appear and reappear, at times without any alteration, effecting a veritable ring-around-the-rosy of texts. . . . Indeed, not only do the fragments circulate, but also the characters. And Clarice herself, as Clarice, identifying herself explicitly as writer-narrator-chronicler. (Gotlib 1988, 189) These textual reappearances contribute to the blurring of autobiography and fiction in The Stream of Life. Texts that were first seen in The Foreign Legion and in the newspaper, and that were then assimilated into the unpublished “Scream- ing Object” in order to define the autobiographical persona, “Clarice herself,” reappear in T…

I turn now to the work of some contemporary women artists and photographers, who, like Solomon, have begun to change the inherited gaze of female beauty. In an interview about her show at the Horodner Romley Gallery (), Mira Schor talks about the history behind a series of paintings in which she used punctuation marks to visualize the boundaries between public and private experience.11 In one she wrote out P U B (L) I C to evoke the pubic/public boundary so prominent in the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas affair. “That led,” Schor explains, to painting incarnated punctuation marks: cunts, breasts, and penises framed by quote marks; red commas and semicolons set into pubic hair, embedded in ﬂesh. Gender positions, no matter how gory their physicality,are put into question by the quotation marks.Markers of printed language are sexualized, and text, which had been so dominant over visuality in fem- inist theory and art in the s,is presented for its visual seduc-

Kathy Acker This project is a feminist study of the idiosyncratic oeuvre of Kathy Acker and how her unique art and politics, located at the explosive intersection of punk, postmodernism, and feminism, critiques and exemplifies late twentieth-​century capitalism. There is no female or feminist writer like Kathy Acker (and probably no male either). Her body of work—​nine novels, novellas, essays, reviews, poetry, and film scripts, published in a period spanning the 1970s to the mid 1990s—​is the most developed body of contemporary feminist postmod­ ernist work and of the punk aesthetic in a literary form. Some 20 years after her death, Kathy Acker: Punk Writer gives a detailed and comprehensive analysis of how Acker melds the philosophy and poetics of the European avant-​garde with the vernacular and ethos of her punk subculture to voice an idiosyncratic feminist radical politics…

reading or a great gig? It didn’t matter. The effect was the same. Afterwards, Acker stood around and chatted with the audience, signed copies, cracked jokes, was patient and unpretentious though she’d just worked really hard in a hot, humid room. Then we filed out into the night, sensing that some­ thing special had just happened. By 1995 Acker was a literary star; regard­ less, she was a woman of our underground, still raging against the system, still writing funny and smart and uncompromising stories for us, changing literature in the process. There is no feminist or woman writer like Kathy Acker (and probably no male writer either). Her body of work—​nine novels, four or five novellas, numerous essays and reviews, poetry, performance pieces, a film script, and two opera libretti published in a period spanning the late 1960s to the mid 1990s—​is one of the most substantial bo…

there prior to the social inscription. In this model, cultural and social norms are viewed as “written on the body”; the body is seen as inscribed, engraved, marked. Elizabeth Grosz uses the example of tattooing and scarification to discuss how in- scription operates. Butler likens inscription to writing and uses the metaphor of “the body as the blank page.” While Foucault’s model of cultural inscription can account for such cases of physical inscription, it also refers to the physical and so- cial conditions that affect the body, such as environment, climate, diet, regimes. Foucault’s main discussion of the inscription model is in “Nietzsche, Genealogy, History,” although his most extended discussions of the body can be found in his genealogical works, The History of Sexuality Volume One and Discipline and Punish, Foucault and the Body 105

(Redding, Indiana). Acker has recently been the subject of a critical biography (Kraus), with another expected shortly (McBride), but only four scholarly monographs have been published: Georgina Colby’s Kathy Acker: Writing the Impossible, Spencer Dew’s Learning for Revolution: The Work of Kathy Acker, Douglas A. Martin’s Acker, and Emilia Borowska’s The Politics of Kathy Acker: Revolution and the Avant-​Garde. In what is an excellent and detailed study of Acker’s techniques, Colby locates Acker as a continuation of modernist experimentation and of the post-​World War II American avant-​garde. In contrast, Borowska focuses on Acker’s connection with the historical avant-​garde and their revolutionary contexts as key to her literary politics, examining Acker’s rewriting of “his­ tory [as] a potent source of revolutionary transformation of the present”, though feminism is a relat…

computer on my hospital bed and was working on the book. I was in the hospital for a month, recovering, reading, and taking notes. Once at home, I began writing. Between sessions of physical therapy and darkroom work, I was able to complete five chapters and select all the photographs by November 2000. Then I found myself unable to concentrate. By November 2001, two more false starts had gotten me only as far as Chapter Ten. I left the manuscript there and fought post-traumatic stress disorder for a year. It was during that time that my physical therapist at USC transcribed for me the words of Abraham Lincoln: "If I had eight hours to chop down a tree, I would spend six hours sharpening my axe." On Halloween 2002, I asked my editor what we should do about the book; I was still feeling poorly. She and the editor-in-chief suggested that I rethink the original concept and tr…

layout in the fall 1972 issue of Avalanche magazine (a special issue devoted to Ac- conci's work).1 The published piece in- cludes a text written by Acconci and a se- ries of photographs of the performance (fig. 4). On the left-hand page are eight photographs of Acconci biting various parts of his body. The photographs are arranged around the edge of the page, forming a sort of frame for a black printed impression of a bite mark in the center. On the right-hand page is an en- larged photograph of a bite mark in the flesh of Acconci's upper arm. The shape of the bottom of every tooth is visible, the edges of some indentations appear- ing much darker than the surrounding skin. Clearly, blood had risen to the sur- face and almost broken through. The excessively detailed, textured 17

41 In Kathy Acker and Paul Buck. 2004. Spread Wide: An Encounter with Kathy Acker and Paul Buck with Further Interventions from Rebecca Stephens and John Cussans. Paris: Éditions Dis Voir, Acker records her dismay that radical cultural theorist and publisher of Semiotext(e), Sylvère Lothringer, with whom she declares herself to be “having this weirdo affair” (Spread Wide, 32), should pronounce that she is “a masochist and will never escape (her) fate” (ibid., 36). She notes with pleasure the effect that the marks on her back have on the bourgeois women in the gym: “all I mean to say my head is gone cause this thing with Sylvere [sic] keeps getting I don’t know what it’s getting it’s not ROMANCE or ANY WORD cause I’m a cripple and he’s so tough – so for fantasies – but meanwhile I might end of [sic] dead and not from extasy though extasy sure goes along with it.

of all other viewers. While the process of inscription by which Kate writes herself into Western culture does indeed disarrange the structures of patriarchy, her self-assertion remains haunted by the problem of solipsism. A recurrent motif in the novel is that of trees “writing a strange calligraphy against the whiteness” (233). This image is an emblem for both writing and painting, evoking on the one hand the blank pages Kate covers with her typed memories, and, on the other, her painting, a large canvas, stretched and painted white, either a surpassingly minimalist work, or the ground- work for a new painting. Kate’s dismantling of tradition creates new space—and by implication the utopian no space of pure potentiality, as though the traces—words, brushstrokes—of extant works might be erased: Still, on the morning after [the snow] fell, the trees were writing a strange calligraphy against the whiteness. For that matter the sky was white, too, and the dunes were hidden,

unconventional in form—lacking a proper start and end. The letter “began abruptly, without any preliminary form of address” (79) and “ended, without signature of any sort” (80). The handwriting is “strange” (78) and “feeble and faint, and defaced by blots” (80), indicating not only Anne’s poor state of health (she has a fatal heart condition) but also a “defaced” narrative. She writes her next note to Laura on “a strip of paper” and buries it underground (297). “Strip” suggests a torn of piece of paper—a fragment—and the dirt presumably defaces this letter as well. Once Laura is kidnapped by Fosco and forcibly institutionalized in an asylum under Anne’s name, she experiences a trauma-induced mental disorder; her symptoms include “weakened, shaken faculties” (434) and being unable to remember or coherently explain what has happened to her. Even prior to this event, Laura is headache- pron…

to her connected with whatever she was trying to convey, many times angrily screaming out: “Stop cutting me off, you’re cutting me off, stop cutting me off!” Such moments were extremely difficult, to say the least, espe­ cially because the ideas she was expressing were almost always matters of barely comprehensible, often incoherent religious reve­ lations. In addition to her words, she presented a series of paintings she had completed some time before. These were chiefly concerned with religious themes (e.g., the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, the Holy Virgin, etc.), but others displayed images of fire and destruc­ tion, with the words “I AM PAIN,” “I AM ANGER,” or simply “I AM,” scrawled across the canvases in large capital letters. One day, many months into our relationship, she informed me that there was a secret project she had been working on for more than 2 years that was…

vors (the same being implicitly true of the later short fiction). One can also imagine the method extending to the interwoven narrative threads of The Body Artist, wherein the sentences of the opening chapter appear cut from two perspectives (those of Lauren and Rey), then reassembled into a single narrative, as if DeLillo had not written one paragraph but spliced one sen- tence per page only to later splice them into the published order. By virtue of its brevity, however, the short story is not a form that would seem to nurture extensive experiments with narrative form within a single

188 Conclusion: what Kathy did (48). She configured her punk writing and her punk girl to perform this ruination for all the girls and women who were too smart, too angry, too fed up, too wanting, too ‘angular’—​emotionally or physically—​to fit the enlarged though still circumscribed places grudgingly made available to them. Extreme parody of the patriarchal imaginary was a prime method of ruination and an index of this confinement: Acker let it all hang out in every novel so she could throw it back in the system’s face. With a lexicon of nym­ phomania, abortions, pelvic inflammatory disease, lobotomies, a Dexedrine-​ addict mother, perverts, brothels, rape—​this was hers and the punk girl’s fin de siècle: schlock horror as heartbreaking, funny, and berserkly realistic. And in the characteristically punk combination of “innovation and annihi­ lation” she gave these women their …

for whom the stories are created. So much so that the people are often convinced the characters are real. In effect, she is telling the people their own stories. Her next step is to find local artists, who are often young people not yet estab- lished as artists, to illustrate the stories. These illustrations further enrich the sto- ries, making them even more real to those who will hear them. We remember once visiting Kathy at this stage of the process and walking onto a beautiful balcony in the early morning sun and seeing maybe ten young people busy as they could be, drawing and coloring their illustrations. In some cases, they were being paid for their work for the first time in their lives. We suddenly began to understand how every step of Kathy’s work was empow- ering those with whom she came into contact—­first the interviewers, then the art- ists, and finally those who would become facilitators in the classroom.

similar connotations of controlled violence. Anderson and Höch have both created scrapbooks of material from magazines, newspapers and fine art as part of their working process. They have similarly ambiva- lent responses to such images both celebrating and critiquing them. Lavin suggests that Höch’s photomontages employ ‘pleasure in the aes- thetic aspects of media photographs mixed with an angry critique of certain social stereotypes’ (ibid.: 124). Anderson has a similarly ambiva- lent relationship with her material. Her often expressed obsession with choreographing patterns means she has always been fascinated by the kind of symmetry and unison that Berkeley’s work exemplifies. Her choreographic approach in Yippeee!!!, however, has more in common with Höch’s practice of appropriating and fragmenting imagery. Höch assembles body parts from different sources to construct new ima…

over the ages. Hannibal Lecter, My Father (1991), a prose collection, and My Mother: Demonology, A Novel (1993) stand out as bold and shocking experiments in anti-Oedipal deconstruction. “Seeing Gender” marks a turning point when Acker, no longer satis- ﬁ ed with deconstructive mimicry, looks for language “other than mime- sis.” Her new aim in writing is not to fabricate a feminine language (or écriture feminine ) nor to visualize the female body in language: “I have become interested in languages which I cannot make up, which I cannot create or even create in : I have become interested in languages which I can only come upon (as I disappear), a pirate upon buried treasure. The dreamer, the dreaming, the dream.” 4 Having repeatedly and thoroughly pirated language, she would now plunder the treasure that lies inarticulate at the heart of linguistic (mis)representation. Looking for a language that

Times Magazine (ﬁg. .).This self-portrait of a strikingly beauti- ful woman, Matuschka, artist, photographer, and model, presents another—and equally disturbing—way both to challenge the acceptable limits of female self-representation and to expose the effects of breast cancer surgery. It was also selected to launch the New York Times th Anniversary issue’s narrative of the nineties, a decade in which women became highly visible advocates for breast cancer awareness. The glamor and drama of the image “drew worldwide attention and won the photographer numerous awards” ();14 it helped draw attention to the politics of treatment. Matuschka’s breast was removed after she developed cancer in . In JoAnne Motichka (the artist known as Matuschka) successfully sued her doctor “for past and future pain and suffer- ing.”The jury granted her $.million, conﬁrming her claim that the doctor had misread her pathology report and performed an

Cultural determinism—or the notion that the body is constructed “all the way down”—is but another way to solve or at least avoid the problematic of death. But because the grand narrative of the afterlife isn’t acceptable to a highly skeptical people, we have turned to medical science (or some- times alternative medicine, as in the case below) to provide us with some- thing like a “postmodern plastic body,” a construction, according to Susan Bordo, that enables the subjects of contemporary Western culture to ignore the body’s facticity, nay, its very mortality (45). Is it possible for culture to finally win the binary war over nature? I’m reminded of the death of Kathy Acker, the postmodernist writer and artist, in November 1997. Acker saw her own body as a medium for artis- tic expression, a sort of clay she could construct, write upon, sculpt. Then she developed breast cancer. Despite surgery in 1996, she refused the sub-

ofpaper and intending to ask the artist about it, absentmind- edly pockets it, and soon thereafter he leaves. Now Pickman has disappeared, and Thurber reveals to Eliot what was on the paper that had been pinned to the unfinished painting- not the photograph of an intended background, but a pho- tograph ofthe ghoulish figure itself: "It was the model he was using-and its background was merely the wall ofthe cellar studio in minute detail. But by God, Eliot, it was a pho- tograph from life" (25). In this rather engaging tale, this portraiture of a portraiture, we shall of course find that the surface pigments are not all that the canvas holds. At the outset one notes that the text's title purports to draw attention away from Pickman and toward his model, though the text goes on, in its peculiar mode ofnarration, to dwell on Pickman himself: The effect is to decenter the text, to quibble from the beginning over focus and center, indeed to make any

4 Introduction body—were an accomplice in the crime, harboring an intrinsic antagonism toward the lynching victim. Beginning with line 4, however, the woman’s physical attributes are bal- anced directly against the victim’s own: lips to wounds, living breath to dying gasp, intact torso to incinerated one. Here the blazon’s anatomizing conven- tions meet their nightmare image—a perverse anti- blazon—as the poem’s second body materializes to haunt and shadow the exemplary body that oc- casioned the poem. This new alignment of body with body, rather than that of body with the weapons of racial violence, suggests a reconﬁ guration of the dynamic linking the poem’s principal ﬁ gures, from one of violent hier- archy to something more like identiﬁ cation, a commonality in victimization. Perhaps the anatomization going on to the left of Toomer’s dashes bears underlying affi nities with t…

body. My tongue will lick from the inside out.” She tells us these things in raucous slang and with the wanton gestures of a cabaret performer. She is making the turns in her story goofy. She takes off the hospital gown; under it she is wearing another hospital gown, decorated with ribbons and red net petticoats, French cancan knickers. She undoes the top ribbons and slowly lowers the gown to reveal her flat chest with no nipples. “I got the first of my scars and lost my hair. I lost my left breast. The right one went as well. My ovaries are next on the list. This is how I forgot how to be a woman.” She does a provocative dance in the red net petticoats, wig, cosmetics with Patrick Swayze portraying Johnny Castle in Dirty Dancing, possessed with the force to hold him in life.2 She leaves, then returns, now no longer in costume, sits with us to lis- ten to us. To a question, she…

the natural process of decomposition. On the other hand, the anatomist has not yet begun his dissection, in the process of which he will cut into and destroy the lines of her perfectly shaped body. The painting enacts a crucial moment of hesitation: the draping of the shroud underscores the aesthetisation by suggesting the materialisation of a statue. The feminine body appears as a perfect, immaculate aesthetic form because it is a dead body, solidified into an object of art. The aesthetically pleasing unity this corpse seems to afford draws added power from the fact that implicitly we know it is about to be cut into. This image of a feminine corpse presents a concept of beauty which places the work of death into the service of the aesthetic process, for this form of beauty is contingent on the translation of an animate body into a deanimated one. Beauty fascinates not only be…

posture suggests assertive stance, staunch bloodletting; it makes taking out a Tam- pax a warrior’s act. This print breaks not only the menstrual taboo but suggests that any revelation, if handled confidently, is possible. Too, Chicago subjects her content to rigorous aesthetic control. In no way does she subordinate formal values to political message. She is confident enough to let the content dictate the form. When I talked with Anne Sharp she told me that the reason so much work in this gallery—owned by a man—was done by women was that women were doing the best work in this area. Two of the gallery’s shows were, in fact, entirely devoted to women. Giant Women in New York I liked most of both shows I saw at the Gallery but found they had, often, a flavor of brilliant amateurism. This partly derived from the sloppy, unprofessional presentation of the works and also from there b…

death. I had two editorial goals which ­shaped my pro­cess. First, to adhere to Anzaldúa’s intentions as closely as possi­ble—­both by following her most recent revisions and by upholding her high aesthetic standards (including her desire to ensure that her book was “quality work”).44 Second, to provide readers with information about the manuscript that would facilitate their analyses, interpretations, and investigations. Because I’d been working on vari­ous writing and editing projects with Anzaldúa for more than a de­cade, I had a solid understanding of her personal aesthetics—­the emphasis she placed on how a piece sounds and feels.45 Anzaldúa took exceptional pride in her work, equally valuing form and content; as I explained earlier, she revised each piece numerous times, honing the images to achieve specific ca­ dences and affects.

the object. During this period I take full responsibility.’’ On the table lie a gun, a bullet, needles, scissors, knives, a rose, perfume, and other assorted implements. One man uses the scissors to slice open the artist’s clothing. Another uses a marker to scrawl ‘‘End War’’ across her body. A third holds the gun to her forehead, frozen in a terrifying moment of unthinkable possibilities. After six hours the artist has been cut and is bleeding, and stunned audience members put an end to the performance.∏≤ In another room, at another time, a ﬁlm begins in close-up.

to say ‘that Barnes’s literary method is, in fact, an ‘emblematic’ one, in that her writing generally relies on visual elements that supplement, intensify and clarify aspects of the language’.65 The Expressionist Schrei performance style had suggested to Barnes a repertoire of heavily stylised techniques that allow her to continue this illus- trative or emblematic form of writing, but without the inclusion of separate illustrations. The poses and gestures of the Schrei performer with their atten- dant vocal outbursts, adapted to the world of Nightwood, create images of graphic fixity and extensive detail like those of an illustration. The visual image is, however, suggested and not set before the reader in printed form. While sculpting the human body into strong and distinctive lines, Barnes can also select and withhold elements of the image, so that we are at times left with little more than a sharply executed silhouette. Nightwood translates

tation may not be altogether ruled out: that of the tableau, or table,2 as a classifying schema, a catalog. Tableau as Engraving, Scene, and Schema The tableau as an engraving or scene generally can be thought of as in- dicating, ﬁrst of all, the placement of bodies into the space of the gaze, the space of the initial cutting up that an elementally fetishistic desire carries out on those parts of the body that are to be enjoyed or mis- treated. This initial act of cutting heralds the crueler, bloodier one real- ized in torture. But the purpose of this movement, the movement from visual cutting to actual rending of the victim’s body to pieces during the orgy, would seem to be the resolution of an aporia articulated in the terms scene and engraving: the deadlock of animate and inanimate, motion and death. To begin with, the body simply observed and described is the province of engraving, t…

imperfect texts, we also reassess the imperfections of our reading techniques. VAS calls for this mode of reading in its use visual erotics: the haptic experience of the novel gives the impression of seeing the object for the first time because the haptic image “resolves into figuration only gradually, if at all” (Marks Skin 163). We experience this when the visual and linguistic print accumulate and bleed into one another excessively. Page 254 presents the collage of the larynx of a dead man with gray prints underneath (see fig- ure 25). Exploring each part of the collage carefully, we realize that there are words written in gray between the body parts, but because the gray in the picture matches the gray of the letters, we have to come close to the tex- ture of each part of the collage to see some letters and even decipher certain words, such as “culturing” and “three.” The picture is superimposed on a

It is in the process of taking these fragments, each of which has its own meaning, and linking them together that an emotion, a guiding line, maybe even a narrative, emerges. Cournoyer then returns to her drawing board to fill in gaps between sequences of metamorphoses. At that point the narrative might take on a completely different direction. So a large part of the editing of the film happens along the way, without the editor actually hav- ing to make any cuts: in the end, the sequence of metamorphoses gives the impression that the film is a long, unbroken single shot. The body For Michèle Cournoyer, the body is the central pivot around which all artis- tic decisions are articulated. The choice of mise-en-scène (the body is the stage on which all the action takes place), the sensuality of her films (in both

that she would be envious of his future lover, whom he said he would love more than he had loved her, adding that “I cannot imagine how you can possibly love her more than you love me now.”54 At around this time, Mako, who has seen Miko’s face following the operation, starts insisting on Miko having plastic surgery. Miko, on the other hand, begins to realize the discrepancy between their perspectives: “I felt strange because you used the past tense in your letters. I wondered if our relationship has become a thing of the past for you, wondered if you knew me only as an already dead woman. And if so, I should let you go, set you free.”55 Both of them, it appears, believe that plastic surgery to reconstruct Miko’s face would help her get out of the hospital. But it is becoming increasingly clear to physicians that Miko’s cancer is spreading beyond their control, and that there is not much point in reconstructing

areas of hiatus.'8 She operates as the castrating female in the most horrifying scene in the text, when she amputates Paul's foot, wielding an axe and a blow-torch. The castration image is under- scored: we are told that Paul is sure, in this scene, that Anilie will castrate hirn, and later Annie coyly confesses that she had thought of cutting off Paul' s 'man-gland'. There could hardly be a dearer image, then, of the feminine as monstrous. Annie is to Paul an image prompting only one response, 'a feeling of unease deepening steadily toward terror'. Yet Annie, like the mother, must exist in order for the selflthe text to begin to be born, in the primary movement of abjection. Like the mother she must be there in order that she may be abjected: in Misery that is the role of woman; she has no other function. There are no positive images of the feminine in this misogynistic text. Annie is particularly dosely associated with the pre-symbolic

mode that has focused most unabashedly upon pleasure and embodiment, female as well as male. Campion’s In the Cut uses a similar strategy in one of its most provocative scenes, in which the protagonist Frannie inadvertently witnesses a graphically portrayed act of fellatio in the basement of a bar. This sets in motion the narrative trajectory of the film as it is soon revealed the woman performing this sex act has been murdered and dismembered, and Frannie begins a potentially perilous sexual relationship with the detective investigating the case. During the course of this narrative, Frannie’s proximity to death becomes ever more claustrophobic: her sister is killed and, finally, Frannie must save herself from her own death at the killer’s hands. Despite the fellatio scene occurring only eight minutes into the duration of the story, Linda Ruth Williams has described this as it…

Schuyler does it; Barthes does it; Conrad does it; Ginsberg does it. Why is it so hard for me to do it? For while I’ve come to know my own body as a mother, and while I can imagine the bodies of a multitude of strangers as my mother (basic Buddhist meditation), I still have a hard time imagining my mother’s body as my mother. I can easily conjure my father’s body, though he has been dead thirty years. I can see him in the shower—tan, red, steaming, singing. I can conjure the slight oiliness of the curls on the back of his head, curls now present on Iggy. I can remember how certain clothes looked on him: a gray cable-knit sweater, his old Levi’s, his daily suit. He was a density of heat and energy and …

261 In an age of body obsession, Gothic Dissections is a promotion of the body part. By dismembering the body and exploring the specific fears associated with each aspect of the human anatomy, this study has allowed for a greater understanding of the value of individual components and the multitude of ways in which they function. Throughout this book, parts have been the subject of severance, extraction, modification, replacement, exchange, transplantation and renewal. For, within Gothic fiction, the boundaries of the body are being creatively disturbed and redefined. Skin as the border that retains and protects the body is also the organ with which we touch and are touched. In Gothic fiction, it is turned inside out, split open, tattooed, burnt and flayed—removed in its entirety to create the cover for the book of the dead or maxim- ised as a canvas upon which books of blood …

Chewed gum twisted in one gesture into a shape that reads as vulva, womb, and tiny wounds marks her face, back, chest, breasts, and fingernails and marks her, too, with pleasure and pain that are not limited to female experience." The editor exclaimed on the manuscript, "That's a lot for one piece of gum! FIX." The scholar thought, "If it didn't do a lot, it wouldn't be art." I define myself indefinitely. Erotic Faculties presents poetry as a foundation for theory, and poetry calls into question exposition's claim to authoritative truthtelling. Feminist poets, critics, and scholars have commented on poetry's ability to incorporate daily life, restructure thought, and move readers and hearers to action. Accordingly, poetry is a necessity for women

Then I showed her hand dropping the knife, trying to get rid of it, and then having to pick it up because more meat needed carving—and dropping it with a clatter. Then immediately a close-up of the man hearing the clatter. Then the woman’s hand clasping and unclasping over the handle of the carving knife. All we saw was a foreground of a table, glasses and cutlery, and her hands hovering. Then back to him. He got up, and the camera tilting up with him. He realizes his danger. I never bothered to show the room, and I allowed that man to go right past the camera towards the woman; and then again he comes to her and he looks down, and the camera goes right from him, following his thought, down to the knife and her hand still hovering over it. And then he makes a grab and she gets it first. Then the two hands: her hands win. And then all you see is two figures, and the man gives a cry and falls.2

234 & and later that same year as a small volume on its own. Her purpose was to be of use to other can- cer-sufferers who had been made to feel shame and humiliation, and indeed, this little book gave comfort to many thousands of patients and their families. In keeping with its utilitarian intent, the writing style was lucid and accessible, purged of that teasing, mystifying opacity that had charac- terized her earlier books. In examining the life-work of any writer, it is instructive to consider which themes, positions, or stylistic maneuvers are carried forth from the past, which ones abandoned or reversed—in other words, how the writer builds on infrastruc- tural footfalls he or she knows can be relied on, even as the new challenge is embraced. So, just as in Against Interpretation, Illness as Metaphor advocates a prophylactic stance against one form of rhetoric; as in On Photography, it rummages far and wide through the literature, accumulating

with intellect). And by devoting just one short paragraph to the actual method of drawing outlines as compared to two and a half pages explaining how to color, Brown both insures the marginal status of female sketching and the serial publication of his next set of outlines. Like Bowles, Brown also insists that he teaches ladies that drawing is only a form of private amusement. This manual is expressly written for a lady who lacks a draw- ing master, but "wishes to amuse herself in painting" (4, emphasis mine). Unfinished and unpolished in its nature, the "sketch" offered a veil of self-effacement, making it attractive for women artists and writers. In- sofar as women were only producing sketches and not finished works, that production was not immediately threatening, partly because strictures against display kept the majority of these sketches from directly entering the market.

Her doctor hears that Frame has won a literary prize and decides she does not need a leucotomy: 'It was my writing that at last came to my rescue. It is little wonder that I value writing as a way of life when it actually saved my life. My mother had been persuaded to sign permission for me to undergo leucotomy' (An Angel at My Table, p. 106). This is something that haunts her throughout her life; the constant question 'what if?': When I was eventually discharged from hospital, Nola [who had a leucotomy] remained, and although she did spend time out of hospital, she was often re-admitted; over the years I kept in touch with her, and it …

a hyper-real quality through enhancement. ‘Reality’ is thrown into question as the spectator tries to decipher what they are seeing and hearing. The scene of self-mutilation that follows employs a split-screen form, showing disparate close-ups of blood-smeared body parts as Esther cuts, intercut with blood upon the kitchen surfaces and bloodied footprints on the floor. This often abstract imagery makes it difficult for the viewer to distinguish precisely what is going on, instead creating a general montage or jigsaw of redness in a scene that could be reassembled in multiple different ways. In My Skin plays with the language of film; self-mutilation, it will now be argued, refuses the regulatory language of the dominant and inscribes a different kind of embodied meaning. The entry into language is regarded as instrumental to the processes of subjectification and as a necessity …

WOMEN RECOVERING OUR CLOTHES 67 turning the body or body parts into fetishes. Sweaters cut low in front or back, bathing suits and lingerie cut high on the hip, cutouts in midriff at the waist, skirt slits or short skirts, cutoff pants—all pattern the cloth- ing cut to focus on bare ﬂesh, and frequently the cuts also direct atten- tion to the fetishized neck, breasts, stomach, genitals, thighs, calves, ankles.9 The slit aesthetic creates the image of the sexy clothed body, an image of phallic female power. We women sometimes respond to this image with desire, the desire to be that sexy woman. It’s all true, I guess; at least I cannot deny it: In clothes I seek to ﬁnd the approval of the transcending male gaze; in clothing I seek to trans- form myself into a bewitching object that will capture his desire and identity. When I leaf through magazines and catalogs I take my pleasure from imag…

that the sight of a heavily scarred young female heroine, criss-crossed with welts and scar tissue would have been a step too far, violating an unspoken rule about ‘flawless’ feminine beauty and the sorts of bodies that are perceived as deserving of being looked at and loved. The figure of the pretty, white teenage girl, often contextualized within American suburbia, is one of the most prominent and frequent depictions of self-mutilation in cinematic representation. Films such as Thirteen, Girl, Interrupted and Secretary draw upon the stereotype in which the ‘cutter’ appears initially as an aberration within the happy domestic setting, with images of pain and misery starkly juxtaposed with mundane domesticity. The early scenes of Secretary abound in these moments: Lee holding a just-boiled metal kettle to her thigh in her very average bedroom, or removing blades and iodine from…

They might even know how it feels to be tattooed, and if not they certainly know how it feels to hurt and bleed, seep, scab, itch, and heal. ☞ Or is the book not a womb, but a wound? Is the book hurt, or dying? The hands smooth down the sheets. Of paper, or of the deathbed. There is nothing they can do to avert what is coming. They contribute only their presence. They attend the patient through its final moments. The scene of reading is a hospice. ☞ Whether written on snow or skin, what the words conjure up, as signs, is accompanied by an ongoing and obtrusive experience of what the words conjure up as matter. These associations summon us forcibly back into our own bodies. So that you could say that the medium interrupts the message.

then, and clarified in its resurfacing by contrast with these decimated rather than just defaced pages displayed nearby, that appropriated Book of Maladies, title unchanged, appears in the form of its bound but also artificially sealed imprint—further violated (after sanding) by the corrosive effect of applied liquid crystals on its open surface. Any medicinal dimension to this paralyzed and psoriatic volume has thus suffered the fate of its own signifiers: a case, so to say, of deformation following function, though gorgeous in the alchemy of its mottling—and potential anthropomorphic molting. In this malady-ridden volume, book conservation and reconditioning are reversed in the etymological male habitus (ill-conditioned) substrate of print impress. Hence, once again the transmediation of the illegible page to the figurative bulk or surface of its own evocation. In each work, content is transferred to form so completely

Thus, throughout the book, the skin does not simply contain the body, nor is skin simply there, already formed, in its place; rather, the skin is both already inscribed, or marked, and is always yet to be inscribed. In this collection, we aim to give life to bodies that, as Donna Haraway suggests so 14 Sara Ahmed and Jackie Stacey

of people to read a book" (161). Of course, this clever reader has been reading something which the author warned him "isn't a nice story," perhaps because, like Sweeney, he wants to find out more about the naked woman promised him for the book's beginning and end. Like Sweeney, he gets his wish. By this time you have probably guessed: Bessie Wilson is Yolanda Lang. So Bessie-Mimi-Yolanda has progressed from being the target of a single murderous gaze to being the target of the collective lustful gaze of a paying audience, Sweeney a member of it. In the conclusion of the novel, Sweeney gets all his wishes: he spends a night with the nude Yolanda and discovers the true identity of the Ripper, who has, in fact, been internalized in Bessie-Mimi-Yolanda. Her manager had stabbed her simply to divert suspicion when he re- alized that seeing Screaming Mimi had triggered a murderous …

In the late 1980s, he turned to architecture and landscape design, producing proposals then works whose humor, if not silliness, are striking, though different in quality from his previous work in other forms.

120 If I Were a Writer and Dead : : : : : : Earlier in the same 1986 interview—long before the final question of what she is “doing now”—Spivak has occasion to mention the temporality of writing books. It seems to come up quite gratu- itously, where one would not expect it. I would like to consider the passage at length. Asked about the way she has challenged phallic metaphors, Spivak says, “One should perhaps clean up the metaphorical situation moment by moment, that is to say, in a certain persistent way.” Picking up on her phrasing, the interview- ers then ask, “Can we clean up metaphor?” to which she answers, “No. It’s like cleaning teeth. You know, you will never be able to clean your teeth once and for all. But cleaning one’s teeth, keep- ing oneself in order, etc.—it’s not like writing books. You don’t do these things once and for all. That’s why it should be persistent” (41, emphasis added). Note Spivak’s repeated use of “persistent” here.

copyedited implies Brennan had already declared the book complete enough to submit to the press. “The ﬁ nishing touches of her favorite chapter,” “the ﬁ nal stages of edit- ing,” “ﬁ nal stages,” “ﬁ nishing touches”—this note insists on how very late in the process she was when she died and how very close to complete the book was. The note ends by telling us that she did not have a chance to complete the review of the copyedited manuscript, and that “the remaining review was completed by . . . Woden Teachout and . . . Sandy Hart.” In other words, the note assures us that Brennan was close to done and also tells us that there was still work to do, work that had to be done by someone else when Teresa died. This authoritative but unsigned note is immediately followed by Teachout’s foreword. In the foreword, as I mentioned earlier, we can read Teresa saying, “Now I’ve said what I’ve been trying to say for twenty-ﬁ ve

It must have been very hard to draw it so well. It couldn’t have stayed still for very long.” “I remembered it,” said Mariko. “I saw one earlier on.” The woman nodded, then turned to Sachiko. “flow clever your daughter is. I think it’s very commendable for a child to use her memory and imagination. So many children at this age are still copying out of books.” “Yes,” said Sachiko. “I suppose so." I was rather surprised at the dismissiveness of her tone, for she had been talking to the American woman in her most gracious manner. The tubby boy leaned further across the table and put his finger to the page. “Those ships are too big,” he said. “If that’s supposed to be a tree, then the ships would be much smaller.” His mother considered this for a moment. “Well, perhaps,” she

that one could expect an enormous book. Instead, not only did Clarice succeed in bringing something tiny into life at the price of a colossal amount of work, but she also succeeded in giving it the form of something small. One is constantly thrown into a paradox. The pain of that paradox consists in making the portrait of the invisible, in rendering visible what has never been seen, to render it visible indirectly. We have a vision that Clarice is in the habit of calling oblique. We can see obliquely whatever is not seen. Says the author that when he sees the northeastern girl looking at herself in a mirror, if he looks straight into the mirror, he sees his tired and bearded face. In order to reveal what is not seen, Clarice has recourse to all kinds of ploys, of techniques, of sidestep- ping. She lets herself be seen. She has to make space for someone as tiny as the northeastern girl. C…

Leavitt’s Tangles, at the moment when the author’s mother is dying. For him this serves as proof that abstract, stylized visual modes do not suit the grand subject of death. “Only at this point,” he writes, “does her mother’s image draw me in; only at this point does she become a particular person; only at this point, then, am I emotionally engaged” (364). He critiques Chast’s memoir along similar lines: “There is a disjunct between her characteristic style and her subjects” (372fn). Going further than most, Couser pronounces what he calls “visual abstractions” – indeed, any deviation from what he deems a realistic style in comics about death and debility – “counterproductive” (356). However, contention over the “propriety” of particular art styles and approaches to given subjects in graphic narrative, such as those voiced by Kam and Couser, seem very much at odds with the verb…

ability and authenticity, in a way that often cannot be matched in actual True Crime works. There is likely more to say on this point, though it is likely, too, that that is a comment better explored beyond the realms of this project. Subsequently, then, while her efforts range in terms of their subtlety, McNamara (2018) is evidently using comparative language throughout as a means to not only build context around her case-telling—the term ‘story-telling’ does not sit quite right here—but also to build this context in a way that holds relevancy to a reader. This conscientious approach is one of the distinctive features of McNamara’s (2018) authorial practice that marks her as one of the expert tellers featured in this monograph. Research as Collaborative Practice By the close of the Prologue, McNamara (2018) has already alluded both to the compulsivity and to the collaborative practice involved in her

large. Someone on the street even manages to videotape it. And, of course, the third is the penultimate scene, which has been foreshadowed at the Clarendon County Morgue. Using the autopsy saw he purchased at the gun show, Lecter performs a do-it-at-home autopsy on the live body of Krendler (essentially a vivisection), opening his skull in much the same way the pathologist has done, incising through tissue and bone. Detach- ing the skull cap, he exposes the brain, slicing and removing it as if for tis- sue sampling. Interestingly, Lecter is following the early modern proce- dure for autopsying the brain memorialized in Andreas Vesalius’s Fabrica. In the brain illustrations of the Fabrica, Vesalius has made an inci- sion across the forehead of the cadaver just above the eyebrows and around the circumference of the skull, allowing the skull cap to be removed like a lid. The preferred method today of incising over the crown of the skull and

C O N C L U S I O N 81 In one segment of Ron Athey's 1994 performance Excerpts from Four Scenes in a Harsh Life (at Patrick's Cabaret in Minneapolis), Darryl Carlton lay with his back to Athey.35 Wearing surgical gloves and using a scalpel, Athey carved a pattern into his African American co-performer's back. Intermittently throughout the process, which was based on an African tribal scarification ritual, Athey placed a fresh paper towel over the incision he was making, slapped the towel, pressed on it to cause the blood from Carlton's back to seep through, and thereby created blood prints. Other perform- ers then hung the prints on a clothesline that stretched over the heads of the viewers.36 In another segment of the performance, Athey pierced his own arm with hypodermic needles (which did not cause bleeding) and inserted needles into his scalp (which did, but the blood was not used f…
