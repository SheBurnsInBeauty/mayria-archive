introduction 2 In “Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power” (1978), Black femi- nist theorist Audre Lorde deploys a theory of the erotic as an inter- nal “measure” of excellence and an “electric charge” that lives out- side the exchange value of a capitalist system of labor.2 This kinetic source of one’s unique sense of pleasure and striving is importantly nonsubstitutable, even though its energies are driven toward a shar- ing between women. Lorde prioritizes the sharing of the erotic— however beautiful and pleasurable or fraught—as structuring the conditions of possibility for greater political and social justice that might have been functionally impossible: for “joint concerted actions not possible before.”3 Yet she is also careful to note that the “erotic cannot be felt secondhand,” that it can and should be shared, but not reproduced through an economy of profi t and gain. It is this qual- ity or “kernel” of the women-identifi ed subject Lorde theorizes here

22 • introduction erotics that breaks with Freudian erotics by centralizing the racialized les- bian body and feminist antiracist struggle.89 Audre Lorde was a poet, novelist, educator, and organizer, who carved out spaces of imagining the interlocking identities of being a black feminist, a lesbian, a mother, and a woman. On the one hand, Lorde was anything but asexual, as her journals, poetry, and biog- rapher Alexis De Veaux speak to her relishing of sex, sexual love, and sexual seduction in her friendship groups and feminist circles.90 Yet on the other hand, Lorde wrote and talked about erotics in a way that did not bind emo- tional depth and intimate relating to sex.91 This is nowhere more clear than in her essay “Uses of the Erotic,” which Lorde wrote four weeks before she found out she had breast cancer, in 1978, for the Fourth Berkshire Conference on the History of Wom…

The erotic as power. I cannot say or think about it without remembering Audre Lorde’s concept of the erotic. Lorde’s “Uses of the Erotic” is a massive and com- munal theoretical dialogue that reimagines the erotic away from Western designs, spiritually reaffirming it for women and people of color especially. Although Lorde did not originate the term or theories of the erotic, her reimagining of them has been a central focal point for feminist studies and African American studies. For those of us who study black genders and sexualities, “Uses of the Erotic” is an introductory document that induces paralysis with the enormity of its expecta- tions and goals and inspires awe with its discursive touch to symbolize the very thing that it speaks about: the erotic. It is a beautiful and delicious essay and tastes, for lack of a better parallel, like a lover well on the way to a climax. However, to fully implement the erotic as power, we must understand the magnitude of funk’s

tween possibility and impossibility. In Audre Lorde’s Zami, her erotic ﬁ ctionalized autobiography, and in “Uses of the Erotic as Power,” Lorde deconstructs the objectiﬁ ed image of the exotically garbed Caribbean woman away from its conscription of human erotic potential servicing the phal- locentric/colonialist/imperialist gaze.3 She has thereby ex- panded the range of erotic vision while adding contradic-

Gloria Anzaldúa, Grace Lee Boggs, Leela Fernandes, AnaLouise Keating, Audre Lorde, María Lugones, Lata Mani, Chela Sandoval, and Linda Tuhiwai Smith are among the many artists and intellectuals creating decolonial thought and practices analyzing the “simultaneity of oppressions” and complex notions of iden- tity as multiple, tactical, mobile, and interdependent that have allowed us to rethink gender and sexuality as core to decolonial being and practice, and not just to ­women or the queer. Theirs is a politics of self-­love, love of com- munity, demo­cratic hope, and creative praxis. Their work stands beside the impor­tant poststructuralist thought of French thinkers —­ critiquing power from within dominant cultural ideol…

only to the transient present ﬁ nding little breathing space in a culture that demands absolutes (“you’re either with us or against us”), holds reality without transformation or trans- gression as an art form, promotes a ﬁ xed future through the socio-political support of the institution of marriage and sexual reproduction within those parameters, and has cre- ated an atmosphere of consistent surveillance to pin down anything before it happens. This absolute certainty is in di- rect opposition to the erotic that remains a site of conﬂ ict and contradiction while actually functioning as a liberating force. Furthermore, absolute certainty cancels out the expe- rience of the impossible that we have seen is necessary to the erotic. Contradiction is the evidence of vacillation be- tween possibility and impossibility. In Audre Lorde’s Zami, her erotic ﬁ ctionalized autobiography, and …

from the erotic, thus limiting the erotic itself. But as we deepen and broaden the range of what we define as lesbian existence, as we delineate a lesbian con- tinuum, we begin to discover the erotic in female terms: as that which is unconfined to any single part of the body or solely to the body itself; as an energy not only diffuse but, as Audre Lorde has described it, omnipresent in “the sharing of joy, whether physical, emotional, psychic,” and in the sharing of work; as the empowering joy which “makes us less willing to accept powerless- ness, or those other supplied states of being which are not native to me, such as resignation, despair, self-­effacement, depression, self-­denial.”7 In another con- text, writing of women and work, I quoted the autobiographical passage in which the poet H.D. described how her friend Bryher8 supported her in persist- ing with the visionary ex…

poetry as a means for elucidating women’s lives. Lorde’s defense of poetry as “disciplined attention” and “a vital necessity” for women’s exis- tence in “Poetry Is Not a Luxury” supports my use of lived experience and reinforces my belief that poetry can be a vital tool for scholars who are intellectually invested both in social change and in the value of simul- taneous thinking and feeling. Lorde critiques the “white fathers [who] told us: I think, therefore I am.” Against this conditioned acceptability of being, she posits the “Black mother within each of us—the poet—[who] whispers in our dreams: I feel, therefore I can be free.”16 By interweaving poetry with theory and the personal, scholars can sharpen and reveal experience and provide a language “to express and charter” the desire and demand for freedom.17 They can create lexicons of pleasure.18 F E M I N I S T C R I T I Q U E S O…

rists. African American poet, essayist, and self-affirmed lesbian Audre Lorde spoke strongly for a broad understanding of eros. In her essay “Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic and Power,” which has reached near-creedal status among contemporary liberal theologians commenting on this issue, Lorde defined eros principally as a “creative energy” and “lifeforce” that has the capacity for “providing the power which comes from sharing deeply any pursuit with another person. The sharing of joy, whether physical, emotional, psychic, or intellectual, forms a bridge between the sharers.”15 It may entail sexual or nonsexual sharing; it may be solitary. It is always “replenishing and provoca- tive” in that it incites and empowers from the deep wellsprings of the self.16 For contemporary theologians, the erotic is inextricably linked to spiritual- ity as the source of human well-being.17 Moreov…

out she had breast cancer, in 1978, for the Fourth Berkshire Conference on the History of Women held at Mount Holyoke College.92 Writing against what she calls the “superficially erotic”—or what we might also think of as the codification of intimacy through the regime of sexuality— Lorde opens up space for a deep intimacy that is not reliant only on sex and sexuality for meaning but that finds satisfaction in a myriad of other activi- ties and relationships to the self and to others.93 Like with Freud, the erotic is an inner resource of power that fuels action and intimacy in the world. In distinction to Freud, however, Lorde’s erotic is not a sexually motivated energy, instinct, or drive, making conceptual space for asexuality in a way that “sexuality” does not. If anything, it is the reverse: The erotic fuels sexual desire rather than sexual desire being at the base of the erot…

our power. They surface in our dreams, and it is our dreams that point the way to freedom. They are made realizable through our poems that give us the strength and courage to see, to feel, to speak, and to dare. (Lorde 2017b: 10–11, emphasis added) In terms of a politics of poetics, Lorde’s vision is compelling. We should pause here, however, because as an epistemology in the register of disciplinary philosophy (and/or sophistry), Lorde’s vision is doubtless open to charges of performative contradiction. This is on the grounds that she is asserting the epistemological primacy of the pre-linguistic, the pre-intellectual and the pre- rational, but through language and by using ideas. While I wish to flag this as an issue that might trouble Lorde’s relation to the discipline, I should also mention that one may always mitigate this kind of charge in two ways. First, one could simpl…

interrelation" (p. 54). While Brooks sees desire as both the force and the substance of narrative, poet and essayist Audre Lorde contends that the source of power for desire lies in the erotic. The erotic is "an assertion of the life force," a "creative energy empowered," which is "self-affirming in the face of a racist, patriarchal, and anti-erotic society."18 She adds that The erotic is a measure between the beginnings of our sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings. It is an internal sense of satisfaction to which, once we have experienced it, we know we can aspire. For having experienced the fullness of this depth of feeling and recognizing its power, in honor and self-respect we can require no less of ourselves, (p. 54) Desire here exceeds sexual pleasure to become consummate self-affirmation, a confirming life force charged with transformative power. A focus on the erotic, then, in the post-Reconstruction domestic novels, to draw on Lorde's

introduction · 9 from affective modalities, and sexuality demonstrates one way that imagination and creativity materialize despite our inability to manufacture evidence for such claims. Funk the Erotic argues that when we consider imperialism, colonization, and slavery, and the indigenous and displaced people they impacted, in this de- bate about the truth of sex, there might be more than two great procedures for producing the truth of sex.16 Funk has produced knowledge about sex but it hails from an alternative order. By specifically nuancing its link with creativity, imagi- nation, memory, and movement, these pages explore African diasporic funk as a possible avenue for producing many long-ignored truths, or competing fictions, of sex and the erotic as power.

By trying to describe something that is difficult, that resists being fully comprehended in the present, we generate what I call “sweaty concepts.” I first used this expression when I was trying to describe to students the kind of intellectual labor evident in Audre Lorde’s work. I want to acknowledge my debt here. I cannot put into words how much I am indebted to Audre Lorde for the extraordinary archive she left for us. When I first read Audre Lorde’s work, I felt like a lifeline was being thrown to me. The words, coming out of her description of her own experience, as a black woman, mother, lesbian, poet, warrior, found me where I was; a different place from her, yet her words found me. Her words gave me the courage to make my own experience into a resource, my experiences as a brown woman, lesbian, daughter; as a writer, to build theory from description of where I was in t…

sitional affirmation of otherness, which would celebrate emotion, intu- ition, delicacy—woman's supposedly natural sensitivities and ways of understanding—is yet another proscription. One of the most important feminist writings on the erotic, Audre Lorde's "Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power," suffers from an assertion of women's sensitivities, which, she says, are naturally invested in the erotic and not the porno- graphic. Lorde understands that the erotic consists of richness, joy, and profundity in living and that erotic living is socially transformative. That feminists have not developed these ideas of Lorde's as a founda- tion for a feminist erotics mystifies me. However, for Lorde the erotic signifies tenderness, emotional resonance, and the capacity to love, 7

reproduced through an economy of profi t and gain. It is this qual- ity or “kernel” of the women-identifi ed subject Lorde theorizes here that I align with singularity: what cannot be reproduced, but can and should exist in relation, and can and should fi nally generate new critical possibilities for subjectivity. It is important to recall the con- texts in which Lorde developed this reading and her broader theo- ries of difference as a dynamic, contingent, and ultimately generative condition that opposes wooden and binaristic ideas of gender, as well as racial and sexual categorization. Lorde was writing and speaking against second-wave ideals of white female individuality in Ameri- can feminist circles, which is a climate ostensibly removed from mid- nineteenth-century Britain and France, where I situate the literary archive of this book. My approach to Lorde’s work is the same one I take with the other critical traditions I engage in this introduction for

funding, publication or praise). Considering what we can learn about doing research from doing sex, and vice versa, takes us to a final vital theme that runs through this book which is the joy of (sex) research. In Audre Lorde’s essential (1984) essay, she argues that the erotic teaches us what we’re capable of and how life can be. She uses a metaphor of the wartime blocks of margarine that were dull and pale but came with a pellet of golden colour that you worked through the block until it infused the whole thing bright yellow. She says that the erotic can be like that in our lives, making the whole thing more vibrant. We can allow the erotic to permeate our lives way beyond obviously sexual experiences, to everything that we do, whether that is building a bookcase or writing a poem (see Barker, 2017). The authors who contribute to this volume provide excellent examples of infusing our research with the erotic in this way.

muck of patriarchal oppression. This erotic project was rooted in the belief that women can form worlds and worldviews apart from patriarchy and gen- der oppression. In the words of Lorde, the erotic surfaces “as an assertion of the lifeforce of women; . . . [the] use of which we are now reclaiming in our language, our history, our dancing, our loving, our work, our lives.”104 Under feminist separatism, each part of life was utilized toward seeking an antisex- ist erotic—from shelter making and building communities to activist work and political organizing. These erotics were grounded in a critical approach to sexism and heterosexuality as well as in the thrill of organizing with other women, or in Lorde’s words, “the power which comes from sharing deeply any pursuit with another person” and in “examin[ing] the ways in which [the] world can be truly different.”105 Separatism had…

In poetry, major figures include Michael S. Harper and Rita Dove (Dove is the subject of a Study Guides on Works and Writers in Part III of this volume), Lucille Clifton, and Audre Lorde; the careers of the Black Arts figures Giovanni and Sanchez have continued into the contemporary era, as well. While their individual expressions and personal visions vary, they have all experimented with the adapta- tion of musical forms into poetry and explored African American history. Clifton and Lorde write about experiences particular to women; Giovanni and Lorde have both written about suffering from cancer. (Giovanni is a survivor of the lung cancer that was diagnosed in 1995; Lorde died of breast cancer in 1992.) In the 1980s and 1990s these poets were joined by Yusef Komunyakaa, who has written about his experiences as a soldier in Vietnam and about African American life in the rural S…

actually, this sex, and this way of being, could be revolutionary. She scares powerful people. Mistresses have been punished for centuries, in every moment of their everyday lives, as well as being literally burnt at the stake.44 Think of the stories we know (some of which I will tell in the next chapter) and the stories there are that we have not heard and that are kept secret at all costs (often at the cost of the Mistress’s own story, her dignity, her joys, her pleasure and her full unapologetic personhood). Audre Lorde has been telling us for a long time about the power of the erotic (not the pornographic, which for her, is the opposite) as both profoundly creative and profoundly feared, by those in power in this racist, patriarchal and anti-erotic society.45 To be in touch with it is to walk the ‘bridge’ that connects the spiritual with the political, and to be persisten…

strategies include the objectification of women – the creation of cultural artefacts from women’s bodies; and the represen- tation of dominance or male authority as sexually arousing. The ‘erotic’ is defined in terms of masculine power, as is the concept of sexuality that every woman is taught. In ‘Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power’ (1978) Audre Lorde notes that ‘[o]n the one hand, the superficially erotic has been encouraged as a sign of female inferiority; on the other hand, women have been made to suffer and to feel both con- temptible and suspect by virtue of its existence’ (Lorde, 1984, p. 106). Because of this indoctrination in patriarchal ways of experiencing sexuality, radical lesbian feminists have been led to assert that heterosexuality itself is reactionary and that heterosexual women are collaborators in the patriarchal oppression of all women. The early lesbian feminist group, the New York Radicalesbians, published in 1970 the ground-

very inﬂuential in feminist philosophy. She is a co-founder of the Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press. She is contin- ually intentional about her race, her lesbian sexual iden- tity and her feminist perspective permeating all her work. Perhaps her most cited and most inﬂuential essay in phi- losophy is ‘The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master’s House’ in Sister Outsider (1984). In this essay Lorde provides a two-pronged critique against patriarchy and mainstream white feminism. Lorde argues that fem- inists that think they can use the methods/tools of patri- archy in an attempt to subvert patriarchy are seriously mistaken because by using patriarchy’s methods they are falling prey to patriarchy, replicating patriarchal prac- tices, therefore furthering patriarchy and not achieving their feminist goals. Another of her inﬂuential essays, ‘Scratching the Sur- face: Some Notes on Barriers to Women and Loving’ in Sister Outsider (1984), illustrates how the term lesbian

[the erotic] flows through and colors my life with a kind of energy that height­ ens and sensitizes and strengthens all my experience.”20 It is that empower­ ing, rejuvenating energy that has been dulled by systems of oppression, which must be recovered for any project of resistance. A significant part of being oppressed, for Lorde, is the suppression of this capacity for feeling, and espe­ cially joy. This could take many forms. As in the example of alienation, I may be incapacitated to enjoy myself, my labor or my life in a menial job. I may be pathologized in my enjoyment of certain bodies under heteronormativity. I may be left with despair, in paralyzing boredom and depression, if all that the world is willing to give me is cruelty and bitterness. Yet a part of many anti-oppressive political struggles is this reclaiming of our capacity for joy,

removed from the everyday. Aesthetic/erotic self-creation as practice requires grounding in actual people’s disciplines, loves, and daily lives. I theorize lived experience—bodybuilding, lovemaking, teaching, dress- ing. In Monster/Beauty lived experience encompasses the recognition that human beings and their bodies are culturally marked in ways that can be transformed by putting the knowledge gained through theorizing into practice. Monster/Beauty also distills experience in poetic developments of ideas. I used this technique in Erotic Faculties, and it remains an unusual one in critical writing. African American and Latina feminist writers and poets who have produced signiﬁcant but not high academic theory, such as Audre Lorde and Gloria Anzaldúa, have recognized the importance of poetry as a means for elucidating women’s lives.

survive as an individual: “Self-preservation warned some of us that we could not afford to settle for one easy definition, one narrow individua¬ tion” (82, 227). As Rowbotham suggests, the historically imposed distortions of iden¬ tity create a solidarity based in consciousness of group identity. For Lorde, the group that provides the necessary support is made up of women, who are extensions of her matrilineage. The autobiography is a narrative of coming to power—the roots and flowering of desire and language. This story of how she grew into “a new spelling of my name” is encircled by a prologue and epilogue which credit that growth to her love for women—first, her mother and, later, the other women to whom she was bound. Lorde’s lyrical celebration of her matrilineage and lesbianism embodies Chodorow’s theory of women’s permeable ego boundaries. “1 have felt,” she begins in…

Time of Protest,” Edwidge Danticat harks back to civil rights-era poet and activist Audre Lorde for renewed inspiration in a difﬁcult time: “Poetry,” Lorde wrote, “forms the quality of the light within which we predi- cate our hopes and dreams toward survival and change, ﬁrst made into language, then into idea, then into more tangible action” (2017, np). chapter one 1 According to Heidegger’s formulation of the “fore- structure” of interpretation, we understand something “as” something only by subjecting it to an interpretive process dictated by concepts and forms already available to us. “Interpretation,” explains William Blattner, “is di- rected toward something that falls within the ambit of our understanding, but which is opaque, resistant, or problematic in some way” (Blattner 2007, 14). 2 In The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the Theory of Fiction, Kermode argues that Stevens borrowed his “general doctrine of ﬁctions … from Vaihinger, from Nietzsche,

sion to power. In claiming that such a poem is masochistic, this book challenges many recent feminist approaches to sentimentalism, which have argued that the pleasures the genre offered female readers lay not in its celebra- tion of the pleasures of submission but in its assertion of female desires for autonomy and agency. Certainly one would not have to look far to see a critique of the patriarchy in “Obedient Love of Woman Her High- est Bliss”: it so starkly represents the violence of romantic ideologies that it could be read as an exposé of them. Such a reading might appeal to feminist critics because it would seem to consolidate a legacy of writing by morally superior women who are indignant at the brutality inﬂicted upon them yet capable only of subversive resistance. But to ﬁnd in such works only a powerless critique of patriarchal bru- tality is to create a false picture of the t…

construction of a potentially helpful cyborg myth: construc- tions of women of color and monstrous selves in feminist sci- ence fiction. Earlier I suggested that “women of color” might be under- stood as a cyborg identity, a potent subjectivity synthesized from fusions of “outsider” identities, sedimented in the com- plex political-historical layerings of Audre Lorde’s “biomy - thography,” Zami (Lorde 1982; King 1987a, 1987b). There are material and cultural grids mapping this potential. Lorde (1984) captures the tone in the title of her Sister Outsider. In my polit- ical myth, Sister Outsider is the offshore woman, whom U.S. workers, female and feminized, are supposed to regard as the enemy preventing their solidarity, threatening their security. Onshore, inside the boundary of the United States, Sister Out- sider is a potential amid the races and ethnic identities of women manipulated …

6 Erotic Infidelities The Wolf Trilogy The erotic always carries with it a certain discontent. Circumscribed by the hegemonic, it can only ever be a profound disappointment so long as it remains mired in heteronormative gender conventions, limited by, or to, phallocentric fantasy. Audre Lorde calls this patriarchal erotic “the confused, the trivial, the psychotic, the plasticized sensation” (1984: 53), and, even in her perhaps overly romantic redefinition in terms of women’s “lifeforce,” she reminds us of the social, political, and sexual confines of the dominant erotic. Such is the erotic implicit in one sense of an erotic infidelity, an infidelity to this (or any) singular erotic. But, I also mean to invoke a second sense of erotic infidelity, an erotic infidelity—that is, the way Carter’s infidelity to her source tales and intertexts is animated by an erotic energy. In this second sense, then, the acts of betrayal are

Lorde: Count the living the same as we number the dead 105 105 as Lorde put it, ‘there is only poetry to hint at possibility made real’ (Lorde 2017b: 10). An affective affirmation of women’s immanent possibilities, particularly the possibilities attendant to their emancipation, is in Lorde’s view a source of hope. It is also a crucial factor in women’s very survival. As Lorde put it, within living structures defined by profit, by linear power, by institutional dehumanisation, our feelings were not meant to survive. Kept around as unavoidable adjuncts or pleasant pastimes, feelings were expected to kneel to thought as women were expected to kneel to men. But women have survived. As poets. And there are no new pains. We have felt them all already. We have hidden that fact in the same place where we have hidden our power. They surface in our dreams, and it is our dreams that poin…

ploded, the romance of black women for black women was creating its own epistolary subcultures, along with emerging solidarities among other mi- nority groups: Jewish, Chicana, women with disabilities, and the like.4 As Audre Lorde put it in 1984, “We have to consciously study how to be tender with each other until it becomes a habit because what was native has been stolen from us, the love of Black women for each other” (Lorde, “Eye to Eye,” 175). The letters and letter literature I have assembled show that all these groups believed that love among women was essential to their libera- tion, an erotic form of class consciousness that went way beyond traditional calls for brotherhood in men’s class struggles. The letter was a textual look- ing glass through which women could pass to ﬁ nd themselves again in love with their own kind. We can understand much of feminist epistolary culture by looking at the

As we have discussed, the three most important components, in the poetry of Adrienne Rich, are the relation of poet and the alien text, the shifting of connotations, and especially gender determination in connection with speaker and addressee interaction — all reveal strategic positions in dis­ course, and are activated in different ways. I will concentrate on the implica­ tions for study of discourse by women from the perspective of the speech situation. Woman-identified texts are the most recurrent feature in the poetry by

Guided by such thought, and mostly following the spirit of Audre Lorde (1984a, 1984b) and Chela Sandoval (2000), I write of the erotic, understood in its broadest sense, and not simply sexually, as respectful relationship and care for self and ­others, that is, as a socially and po­liti­cally significant practice of love that is creative of au­then­tic self…

I would turn first to Monique Wittig, whose critique of fixed categories of sexuality and gender make it possible for her to claim the word "lesbian" as curving beyond the "straight mind." For in this straight epistemology, as she explains, the very "categories of language" force us ''to speak of ourselves and to conceive of ourselves as women and as men," and in so doing make us "instrumental in maintaining heterosexuality" (Straight Mind 30).

mid-1990s. The ﬁrst of these discourses to develop was the feminist ﬁguration of identity in terms of “multiple oppression” or “double jeopardy” during the 1970s and 1980s.10 This approach stresses the differences among women. It focuses on op- pression as the main constituent of identity and leads to the additive naming of kinds of victimization on the basis of race, class, religion, sexuality, national origin, ableness, and the by-now formulaic “et cetera” and “so forth.” At times, this discourse expresses a kind of interminable negativity evident in the pileup of oppressions, with its implicit hierarchization of suffering. But this discourse has also developed a dialectical analysis whereby the multiplication of oppression creates its antithesis, a multiple richness and power centered in difference, as Audre Lorde theorizes in “Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redeﬁning Differ- ence” …

emotion. “The Victorians,” she observes, “seemed to understand sympa- thy as both an emotion and an affect”; “re-orienting our [own] notions of sympathy to the body can allow us to reconsider historical understandings of emotion, as well as our own terminology for affective phenomena.” And though she looks back only a few decades from our current moment, Jamie Ann Rogers also seeks to better historicize current theorizations of affect in her chapter on the contributions of Black feminist writers. Rogers contends that the writings of Audre Lorde, June Jordan, and Toni Morrison “not only offer compelling commentary on the workings of affect as political labor, but also are themselves powerfully affective, pro- ducing ‘affective flights’ that move within and among readers, and become part of the affective circuits or ‘structures of feeling’ that condition the different realities i…

given as a talk at the National Women’s Studies Association in 1981 and subsequently published in Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches (1984).11 It predates both Hochschild’s book and Jaggar’s essay and can be read as a background to both. The poet-theorist warns that “I do not want this to become a theoretical discussion” (Lorde 278), thus marking the emergence of a very particular kind of feminist theory, with its signature emotional style. Throughout, Lorde deploys the word “use” (“the uses of anger”) creatively as a gesture against a certain mode of theorizing that risks remaining abstract and academic. Since “anger is loaded with information and energy” (280), feminists can tap it as a resource—a resource not for the labor market or philosophical argumentation but for politics. Lorde’s essay is both precise and creative in its affective use of pronouns—an embodied “I,” a pl…

and that it can and should provoke new thinking about the borders and boundaries for feminist politics. And while I welcome such critiques of my choices here of what to include, I do strongly encourage readers to sit with the work and let it draw you in. The book’s organization focuses on eight themes: Queer/Trans, Anticapitalist/Anarchist, Angry/Violent, Indigenous/Women of Color, Sex/Body, Hacker/Cyborg, Trashy/Punk, and Witchy/Bitchy. Each of these sections includes a diverse range of manifestos and encompasses both historical and contemporary manifestos (and some right in the middle). This design invites readers to see themselves reflected in this collection, often in surprising ways. As Audre Lorde argues: So we are working in a context of opposition and threat, the cause of which is certainly not the angers which lie between us, but rather that

difficulty he provides her with a 'milder sister' who roves through softer, more appropriately pastoral landscapes, but he cannot resist the compelling nature of the 'ardent genius' who 'flies' 'thro' wilder scenes and sterner skies'. True to her gender, Romance cannot be pinned down; she refuses the softer, more genteel life her sister leads; she is not 'romantic' but unruly. Her demeanour suggests not pliability, not love, but mastery. As the poem shows, much of Romance's attraction lies, for Southey at least, in her ability to control, through a kind of stern sexiness, both the elements and her readers, here embodied by Southey's poet persona: as both reader and writer of what he reads he occupies a uniquely supervisory position, both in thrall to and in control of a genre. But Romance herself asserts an authority that compels the poet to versify her history, and in a chronology heavily indebted to Hurd, Warton, Reeve, and the other theorisers of earlier

Introduction 9 operates as a passport to the world, as sheer extimacy, but does not necessarily reveal anything of the poet that is personal or intimate. Considering their essay ‘The Lesbian Poet’, I think about how Myles toys with gender in a way that is not dissimilar to Stein. While claiming a female destiny for themselves, Myles also creates a space to ‘become man’, which is only possible in moments of intensively felt freedom. These aspects of gender play are also realized in the way that Myles writes about sex, focusing on pornography particularly. Porn allows the writer to unpack their own poetics while considering how we are cultured to approach specific bodies in specific ways. Throughout their work, Myles carries a constant irreverence, with their speed of movement and lightness of phrase implementing a poetics of flippancy. This is, however, problematized through the…

Foreword • xvii When women writers challenge these power structures, implicitly or explicitly, they are being radical even if it doesn’t feel that way in those moments of writing. I do not know whether the women whose words comprise this anthology thought themselves radical, but they were. They dared to believe their voices mattered at a time when men rarely acknowl- edged that women even had voices. They dared to believe they had a right to publicly articulate their understanding of the world. Whether through prose, poetry, or drama, they challenged societal expectations. They chal- lenged, perhaps, what they expected of themselves. They made their mark on their world. They created work that endures. And that is the most radi- cal thing of all.

The stings from those talons made me wetter. “She sucked at my breath now, and her hands were everywhere on my back, her prick a rod. Then I felt the wings. I felt their size, and they brushed me like a breeze from the middle of May, only softer. Each wing stroke a counterpoint to the joint rubbing against me, urging me to open to her. “It’s my hands that remember. Her scent is on them and will never leave. I smell it when I touch the clay or rest my hands on the stone. Every wing touch brushes me, my legs, my behind, and all through my hair and the down on my cheek.

male genital organs conquering supine females, these women writers wrote about relationships, “emotions…, contemplation, [and] conscious reverie” (281). While it seems unlikely that such a writerly act like Maud’s would frequently occur in the Victorian era, I find that contemporary women writers of the neo-Victorian novel, like these female Victorian counterparts, do redefine the erotic but in a distinctive way.1 In their re-­ envisioning of the Victorian novel, these women writers draw on various conceptions of the erotic from classical to contemporary, but, in addition, they gravitate toward the way Audre Lorde defines the erotic as “the life- force of women, [it is] creative energy empowered” (Lorde 55). Lorde argues that: [t]he erotic has often been misnamed by men and used against women. It has been made into the confused, the trivial, the psychotic, and plasticized sensation. For this reason, we have turned away from the exploration and

132 David S. Reynolds A similar intensiﬁ cation through poetic fusion occurs in one of her most famous love poems, “Wild Nights – Wild Nights! ” (J 249). It is not known whether Dickinson had read any of the erotic literature of the day or if she knew of the stereotype of the sensual woman.18 Given her fascination with sensational journalism and with popular literature in general, it is hard to believe she would not have had at least some exposure to erotic literature. At any rate, her treatment of the daring theme of woman’s sexual fantasy in this deservedly famous poem bears comparison with erotic themes as they appeared in popular sensational writings. Th e ﬁ rst stanza of the poem provides an uplifting or puriﬁ cation of sexual fantasy not distant from the eﬀ ect of Walt Whitman’s cleansing rhetoric, which was consciously designed to counteract the prurience of what he called the “love plot” of much popular ﬁ ction. Dickinson’s repeated phrase “Wild Nights”

been written by her culture, but who, in turn, is shown to be capable of rewriting it. Pen does not simply lament the fact that no social discourse has as yet attached the word “hood” to “lesbian,” using instead the “ism” that sounds “like a digestive disease” (114); she goes further, creating a textual web of interconnections that sexualizes the word “hood” and promotes a novel discourse on lesbianhood, an identity that is embodied privately, shared communally, and recog- nized publically. Pen raises an image of the folds covering the clitoris, “not a hood to take off, but to push back” (257); the image echoes the Olga Broumas poem that serves as the novel’s epigraph by conveying the special significance of social invisibility and silence for lesbians. From its opening page, Hood foregrounds how silence and invisibil- ity might be placed in the service of imagining an open fut…

power. This silenced history is verbal and nonverbal, and it includes women as heroines in history. Rich — and the feminist poet in general — opposes the notion of woman — the female, feminine — as a mere subordinate of shadow of man, and the culturally assigned weakness and inferiority, the supposed flimsiness attrib­ uted to women; in contrast, the poet sets forth the notion of woman as center of inherent strength, as substance itself, as an empowered being inter­ preting the world from the inner eye of woman. This textual world can be explained as a synecdochical embodiment of language; for feminist writers a woman's text is an integral part not a mere appendix of the general symbolic text of human culture; strictly speaking, they assign specific properties to their work. It is most important to underline that Rich understands her texts as do other poets in the same line, as part of feminist discourse (since 1971), a

Although Lorde’s eroticism accepts nonhuman entanglements, it remains life- and self- aﬃrming. Perhaps surprisingly, then, OOF’s erotics are better aligned with a version of eroticism theorized by Georges Bataille, as the radical surrender of self in becoming other- than- subject. Through physical, emotional, and religious eroticism, “discontinuous” individuals attain continuity with the object world. Forgoing the subject’s instinct for self- preservation, eroticism heeds no boundary, neither the boundary between self and other, nor even the boundary between life and nonlife, putting connection and con- tinuity with the world above self- annihilation. “Eroticism,” Bataille writes, “is assenting to life even in death.” Bataille’s eroticism remains grounded in a humanist subject- position of sovereignty (doomed

xxiv Introduction that, with the exception of Suzanne Juhasz's Na1{ed and Fiery Forms: Modern American Poetry by Women, A New Tradition and more recently Emily Stipes Watts's The Poetry of American Women, 1650 to 1945, the models of most feminist critics almost always derive from and pertain to prose writing and are not directly applicable to poetry. We have, therefore, emphasized practical criticism because we believe that a general theory can emerge only after a full comprehension of the range and richness of women's poetic voices, many of which have so far barely been heard. All the essays in this anthology, then, seek to revise our inherited notions of literary history by recovering lost poets and lost poems, by finding the "grandmothers" Barrett Browning sought, and by thus tracing the outlines of a distinctively female poetic tradition. One book cannot, of course, com- pensate for generations of neglect and misunderstanding: although we have included essays on many major women

Lowell’s poem, rather like ‘The Captured Goddess’ and ‘Sisters’ discussed earlier, begins by reclaiming and embracing the trans- gressive ﬁgure of the witch. The identity of the speaker or speak- ers of the poem is unclear. The poem at ﬁrst seems to report the popular accusations of the crowd (‘“Witch! / Witch!”’) but then slips into the rather more intimate and amatory tones of a lover: ‘Thighs and breasts I have loved; Lips virgin to my thought, Sweeter to me than red ﬁgs;’ The poem is explicit in its evocation of lesbian sexuality (the ‘red ﬁgs’ connoting perhaps the open vagina?), but it is also explicit about the taboo against this kind of relationship and the social price it demands. “Is my heart wicked?” the speaker asks, demanding of herself a response to the criticisms implied of her by others. It is explicit, too, about the pain attendant on the breakdown of such a relationship…

Stories, performances and case studies used in the book are a way to explore alternative constructions of femininity, embodied knowledge and the Bad Girl. Central to the book is the articulation of femininity, specifically femininities demarcated as ‘Bad’, problematic, indecent, pornographic and unsafe. How gender and sexuality are negotiated in various spaces, and the issues that emerge are key features of the case studies (Ms T, Empress Stah and RubberDoll, Mouse and Doris La Trine) and how they offer a challenge to binaries (i.e. cleanliness/ dirtiness and the good/Bad Girl). These situate the Bad Girl as a site of power and transformation. My voice and self-identity As the book explores voice and experience, it is important for me to

to her question. We have something to work out here. Audre Lorde writes persuasively about how caring for oneself can lead you away from engaging in certain kinds of political struggle. And yet, in A Burst of Light (1988), she defends caring for oneself as not about self- indulgence but self- preservation. She is making for us a distinction. She is sharpening a tool. This kind of caring for oneself is not about caring for one’s own happiness. It is about finding ways to exist in a world that makes it difficult to exist. This is why, this is how: those who do not have to struggle for their own survival can very easily and rather quickly dismiss those who attend to their own survival as being self- indulgent. They do not need to attend to themselves; the world does it for them. For those who have to insist they matter to matter, self- care is warfare. We could think here of #blac…

arguments is a deﬁning feature. As is by now no doubt clear, the terrain new audacity writers occupy, even the lives they lead, can be considered interventions into long-standing but continuing debates within feminism, especially, although not exclu- sively, Anglo-American feminism. In these new audacity texts, trans peo- ple’s identities are not a matter for dispute; rather, they are valued contributors to feminism. Sex work is discussed as bodily labour, not as a stigmatised blemish upon a woman’s reputation. Sexual submission is explored with curiosity and does not debar one from being a feminist. New audacity writers challenge discourses of victimhood that damage women’s agency. They believe it is not just men but women – and sometimes feminists – who need to change in order to address misogyny and dis- crimination. They often demand large-scale social and structural change rather than place their hopes in reform, and they are determined to break

My own experiences of lust, ecstasy, and rage play an important role in these works. But lust, too, took me deeper into the body politic and the lust for power. It straddles individual and group activities. A partic- ular lust dear to me, writing lust, poetry lust, received some care and poets will, I think, like what I say about their particular addic- tion, what poetry opens. Tradition tells us death haunts lust and this notion is no stranger to psychoanalysis. I use some of Lacan’s writings on death in lust to heighten the interplay of our pairing of lust and mortality. A premature dying haunts experience, as if we drag a kind of self- 142 FLAMES FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS

cliché).87 It is this collaboration, in our terms, of irony with power—with, let us say, a nostalgia for newness—that allows us to read irony in and as pain. It is, in other words, because irony marks the failure of irony and the sublime each to coincide with its own definition that power may in turn be seen to fall short of stabilizing its class- and gender-specific constructs of family and love. As the narrator, having read his thought in the eyes of the poor, turns to read it again in the eyes of his companion, we understand that “authentic” love is merely the desire for the same: the unexceptional desire to read one’s exceptional self—to read oneself and to see oneself read, reread, published everywhere. Love, like art, is prostitution. “Love,” writes Baudelaire, “wants to go outside itself, to merge with its victim, like the conqueror with the conquered, yet at the same time to pre…

Introduction i9 contest between the competing desire of the “real” that poetry could yield versus the “imaginary’1 or dream world. Both poets rather openly exhibit what I call Lacanian desire, and it is my intention that the reader, after reflecting upon my text, respond more fully to this trope as it peaks early in both Coleridge and Keats.16 Not surprisingly at this point in our critical histories, then, Words¬ worth establishes the vocabulary for a discussion of desire as the motor J of Romantic poetry, in many ways a local rather than strictly literary decision on my part, inspired because of the suspiciously congenial home he has found in recent cultural materialist studies. In a compli¬ cated way, this is to say that our current normal reading of the “real” Wordsworth depends upon our assumption that he either consciously or unconsciously translated political anxieti…

Introduction 5 network of signification. Against this landscape of given certainty, Gamble values Doty’s poetry and memoirs for their indeterminacy, and their appreciation of style over prescribed, which means to say pre-scribed, content. Cedric Barfoot next offers his quietly disturbing lyric, ‘Fissures’, followed by Tatiani Rapatzikou’s ‘Viral Seduction and “Penetrated” Bodies in Rob Hardin’s Poetry’. Rapatzikou argues that Hardin deploys a textual strategy that depends upon the body as an interface between the mind and the typographically represented poetic experience. Rapatzikou demonstrates that Hardin’s ‘bio- empowered discourse’ has the two-fold ability to represent the vulnerability of the body while also enacting the power of the body and language to heal and reproduce. Vicki Feaver’s ‘Rope’ is a compelling lyric of newly-discovered adolescent sexuality expressed …

to continue to operate as it does. 1 argue that the haecceity is the unfulfilled promise of happiness (Adorno, Aesthetic Themy) that modern art, including poetry, is. 1 then turn again to Denise Riley's poetry, this time focusing on it as innova- tive feminist poetry. Finally, 1 examine poems by Andrea Brady and Keston Sutherland. The two poe ms examined come from the same publication and both are concerned with the war in Iraq and the revelations of torture at Abu Ghraib. 1 find that Brady's poem utilizes elements of narrative to pro duce a paradoxical simultaneous solidarity with both Lynndie England and her victims insofar' as England is presented as to sorne extent a victim (both working class and female) of an essentially hostile society, while she is never absolved of responsibility for her actions. Sutherland's poem, on the other hand, eschews such solidarity in order to present readers with a fractured poem of near-

holds apart the poem’s central ﬁ gures also brings them into an unsettling imaginative and aff ective linkage that provokes reactions ranging from desire to dread. The poem vividly reﬂ ects how the eff ort to assign black men and white women to diff erent regions of social, sexual, and textual space and to separate columns in the South’s ethical ledger only ﬁ xes and fuses the two all the more indelibly in the dominant cultural imaginary. The poem’s mu- tually implicated bodies hint at mutually constitutive subject positions: his violated, tortured body establishes her whiteness and charges it with value, even as the vulnerability of her slim white frame functions as a tacit demand that his ﬂ esh be blackened, meaning not just racialized but hideously carbon- ized as well, heat blistered and ﬁ re scarred.

lenges us to question Bonnefoy’s and Nancy’s relation to power. They do not face the same pressing need that Glissant does to contend with and to mitigate the effect of oppressive systems of objectification and instrumentalization. Their work cultivates a salutary and hopeful new ethics but, we might ­wonder, what resources does it give us to cope with the patterns ingrained in us by systemic modes of oppression? Is there no means of actively engaging with these systems in order to reorient them? Are we content with the lack of social, cultural, and political specificity in Bonnefoy’s work, the use of a universalizing language that prevents him from addressing particular social and environmental predicaments in real places? Bonnefoy would surely contend that conceptual thought is at the root of all objectification and instrumentalization and that the task of poetry is to find …

“The Lady of the House of Love” 117 Here, Case reads the female vampire against her usual interpellation as deadly monstrosity, suggesting instead that the dangers she poses for and to dominant culture might also challenge hegemonic representations of female, and especially queer, sexuality. Although Carter’s vampire Count- ess is not queer in Case’s sense, her “vampirish love-bite” nonetheless dis- turbs dominant discourses of love and romance. Implicit in the Countess’s life as narrative are questions of agency and alternatives that drive both the intertextual tale and the metanar- rative, and Carter twice asks, “Can a bird sing only the song it knows or can it learn a new song?” (1993: 93, 103). It is a question asked through a metaphor with multiple referents—the Countess, the author, our gen- dered social scripts—and in “The Lady of the House of Love” Carter sug- gests that the answers might be tightly entangled. For instance, just as

Poetry is certainly renaming of a kind, as Emerson observes in “The Poet.” It is ﬁnding the words that connect past to present, thereby transforming the present reality from something intoler- able to something one can live with, even love. The mind of the poet supplies a light to the minds of others, kindling their imag- inations, helping them to live their lives. It is a confrontation, a counterpressure, an alternate world of reimagined language that informs the reality that is everywhere pressing and pulling, shout- ing and—in this day and age—exploding. Power, says Rich, is essential in the poet, in poetry itself; but this power “is not power of domination, but just access to sources.” This means connect- ing readers to the history of language itself, to the history of human encounters with the violent realities that surround them, and to the history of human success in the struggle …

(27). Women’s health activists called for women to liberate themselves from the masculine medical establishment by becoming knowledgeable about their own bodies, particularly with regard to reproductive health. In the spirit of this movement, in her memoir The Cancer Journals, poet Audre Lorde refuses to ac- cept breast cancer and mastectomy as a loss; instead she writes about her illness as an opportunity to redefine her body, her self, and her voice. Then came AIDS. When AIDS first appeared in the United States in the early 1980s, it was immediately defined as the “gay plague” or “gay cancer” and openly discussed as a divine punishment wrought on the culturally marginal communities it disproportionately infected—gay men, intravenous drug users, Haitian immi-

Introduction 23 The collection concludes with an afterword by celebrated noir and fem- inist scholar Paula Rabinowitz. Rabinowitz provides a power ful reflection on both the power and limitations of noir affect as a global model for the neoliberal pre sent, arguing that we also need to attend to noir’s younger sister, melodrama. If noir affect is a mode of con temporary culture, melo- dramatic affect may trump it as the pre sent’s dominant mode. In a world in which right- wing strong men (starting with Donald Trump himself) are openly enjoying power and propagating sexual vio lence and in which re- spectability regularly is undone by exposed secrets, melodrama may indeed be the acting mode. For Rabinowitz, the con temporary social narrative takes the form of obscene fathers, family romances, and family secrets made public. If noir tends to be about a masculinized social worl…

have chronicled their considerable and costly battles with illness, accident and ageing – with Lorde, who among the three is deceased, describing the process of her dying from cancer in moving poetic terms. All three cultivated a personal style as a means of facing up to their human and specific vulnerabilities. And unlike Breillat and Didion, Lorde suffered the further vulnerabilities that come with being a woman of colour and a lesbian in post-war America. Taken together, Breillat, Didion and Lorde help to teach a range of lessons from what I have defined as an existential philosophical perspective. Approached in the right spirit – and again, speaking from my own experience – they refresh and inspire the disciplinary practice. The selection of sources is admittedly far from perfect.

Powers of Horror has been interpreted as part of a trilogy of works that together represent Kristeva’s turn toward psychoanalysis; these include Tales of Love and Black Sun. 3. In Intimate Revolt, Kristeva defines the abject as a notion she develops from her clinical experience and as a symptom of a psychical economy where the separation between the subject and the object is not clear: “which also refers to the archaic rela- tionship of nonseparation with the maternal container: the mother being the primary abject” (2002a, 260). 4.
