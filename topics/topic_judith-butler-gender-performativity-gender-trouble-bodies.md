sexual identity’ (2000: 55). In the wake of Gender trouble Butler has sought to qualify many of her stand- points in order to repudiate what she sees as misinterpretations. Bodies that matter (1993), in which she elaborates her concept of materiality, is largely framed as a disclaimer against charges that her discursive-performative understanding of sex and gender amounts to idealism. Similarly, the collection of essays in Undoing gender (2004) are very much formulated as a mostly implicit response to the criticism she has received. Still, I see Butler’s work as consistent over the years. The focus of her theoretical enquiries has changed slightly and Butler makes several attempts to qualify the framework laid out in Gender trouble , but with few exceptions 1 she never openly disqualiﬁ es and reworks the latter. In the following 2 Judith Butler and the deconstruction of reality

ing of sex and gender (see 148). Judith Butler’s two books Gender Trouble and Bodies Thai Matter come across as massive attempts to hammer the sex/gender distinction into poststructuralist shape. After showing that gender is performative, Butler aims to prove that vex is as constructed as gender. In her pursuit of a histor¬ ical and political understanding of the body, Butler never asks whether the sex/gender distinction actually is the best framework for her own project.

reflect on its symbolic system. The question remains if the disadvantages that the symbolic system creates for women would be annihilated by the new symbolic modifications, which open it to self-identification in the name of equality and inclusion. The fourth chapter, “Different Ontologies in Queer Theory,” compares Butler’s ontology of the body as embedded in her queer theory with the naturalist accounts of sexual difference of Elizabeth Grosz and Claire Coleb- rook. First, I focus on Judith Butler’s ontological understanding of the body, in Gender Trouble, which dates from 1990, and Bodies that Matter, which responds to objections in 1993. In Gender Trouble, sexuality is said to give rise to the construction of sexual difference, and gender identity is explained as an outcome of a gendering process. Butler transforms the idea of social

are actually a direct result of ‘acts’, performances that are not inherent to us as either male or female but socially determined. Eschewing essentialism in regard to both sex and gender, Butler believes that gender is established and identity constructed through a complicity in gendering acts. The queerness of her text, and especially a focus on the multivalent gender trouble of drag queens, calls this performativity into question, finding spaces in which a complex intersection of sex, gender and sexuality means that the culturally constructed acts begin to fail. Potentially rupturing the subject’s easy participation within the reiterative acts of heteronormative gender, queerness introduces a different form of temporal duration, one that is perhaps focused on a more conscious engagement with the gendered stylization of the body. An awareness of performativity, as Butler outli…

and political referents of that debate, between sex and gender. At the same time, it also bypasses the current difﬁculties of a feminism that calls for attention to an end- less catalogue of “differences” other than gender (race, class, ethnicity, sexual orien- tation, etc.), neither by ignoring those differences nor by seeking a closure to that catalog, but by articulating them through an anti-essentialist democratic politics. In Gender Trouble, Judith Butler suggests such a politics when she argues that gender “ought not to be constructed as a stable identity or locus of agency from which various acts follow.” Butler concludes by calling for a politics “no longer understood as a set of practices derived from the alleged interests that belong to a set of ready- made subjects.” While this argument may lack speciﬁcity, it remains signiﬁcant in its opening of feminism onto questions concer…

as a sign of collapse or dissolution rather than a marker of disjunction. Nor does she parse gender and sex and sexuality, although she will argue for their conceptual and methodological separateness a decade later in “Thinking Sex” (1984). The work of Judith Butler (1956– ) has a singular place in this genealogy. Butler completed her PhD in philosophy at Yale University in 1984, where she worked with phenomenologist Maurice Natanson, and has spent most of her career to date in the Departments of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at the University of California at Berkeley. All of Butler’s work might be described as an exploration of the conditions of possibility of the subject, where the condition that has received Butler’s most sustained attention is gender. Butler rethinks gender by casting it as a performative, a doing rather than a being, and her theory of gender performativity can be read as a continuation of a tradition in twentieth-

one which has also been made of the work of Judith Butler, with whose notion of the `performativity' of gender it has aspects in common. For Butler, `performativity requires a power to effect or enact what one names' (1995: 203). It is the process of naming gender which brings it into being, and its constant reiteration both produces and regulates the norms of sexual difference. As subjects thus produced, gender becomes for all of us `a kind of doing, an incessant activity' performed as a `practice of improvisation within a scene of constraint' (2004: 1). Butler's discussion of the performance of gender here is framed in terms of narrative. As subjects brought into being 82 WOMEN, FEMINISM AND MEDIA

citing of all were Judith Butler’s books Gender Trouble (1990) and Bodies That Matter (1993). Exceeding the paradigm of two sexes to speak of what seemed like an infinity of genders, Butler argued that sex was a cultural construct, and that as such it was inherently vulnerable to cultural perver- sion. As one of my favorite lines from Gender Trouble explained, “If there is no radical repudiation of a culturally constructed sexuality, what is left is the question of how to ‘do’ the construction one is invariably in” (31). In his famous explorations of masochism and fetishism, Tanizaki defi- nitely seemed to be “doing” his male and female constructions with the performative flair that Butler celebrates. Especially in the works on which I wanted to focus, from what Nakagami Kenji calls Tanizaki’s “overripe” period in the 1930s (“Monogatari” 130), relations among and between the sexes seemed no less perverse, and no less promising. The problem

of women’s and gender studies and feminist theory. As Martha Nussbaum states in a 1999 article, ‘Butler seems to many young scholars to deﬁ ne what feminism is now’ (1999: 38). Her seminal work Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity (1990/1999) shook the fundaments of feminist theory by its radical questioning not only of gender but of biological sex too. Ever since, her theory of sex and gender as discursively produced performative effects is widely repre- sented as the alternative to essentialist accounts of gender. As Hennessy states, the attention that Butler’s work has received ‘indicates that her ideas have struck a chord in a certain sector of the public imagination of new ways of knowing sexual identity’ (2000: 55). In the wake of Gender trouble Butler has sought to qualify many of her stand- points in order to repudiate what she sees as misinterpretations. Bodies that matter

Dis/Identification In terms of gender, one might surmise that Žižek’s criticism of such an ethical turn is referring to the work of Judith Butler, whose Gender Trouble (1990) usefully brings together much of the work on melancholia in psychoanalysis to suggest the melan- cholic structure of gendering, and through that, of sexuality. Whereas the Kleinian understanding of developmental sexual formation may lead us to think that pleasures of polymorphous perversity or bisexuality are given up and these are lost in the trajectory toward normative heterosexuality, Butler emphasizes something different. For her, gendering itself is in effect a function of a demetaphorization, and one that is realized in the performance of heterosexuality as it is founded on a loss that is sustained in a crypt. Butler notes Irigaray’s questioning of the developmental form of sexual difference in Freud, emphasizing how this encrypted loss is afﬁrmed through

things the great variation of styles and forms of masculinity in diﬀerent cultures and countries. Our understanding of the ways in which sexual identities are constructed, interrogated and called forth by dis- cursive practices also owes a great deal to the work of Judith Butler in Bodies That Matter (Butler, 1993) and Gender Trouble (Butler, 1999). Her work has had an extensive inﬂuence on the ﬁeld of body studies, including the study of religion and the body (Armour and St. Ville, 2006). In modern secular societies, feminism, gay liberation and women’s movements have articulated a range of claims for social equality and access to alternative sexual, familial or coupling arrangements, such as gay and lesbian marriage. These legal and scientiﬁc changes create the conditions for experiments in reproductive relationships that constitute a radical challenge to both traditional religion and …

a subject, but that imagined subject is always embodied, and the body is always constituted through tropes. (This idea of the body as being a ‘lived schema’ through which the world is mediated is sustained today across a range of disciplines including neuropsychology, linguistics and political theory (Gallagher 2005; Gibbs 2006).) However, it was just this sophisticated post-Butler attitude of think- ing of the body as other than representation through representation that precluded one from really thinking what the body might mean. Butler published Bodies That Matter at least partly in response to the putative linguisticism of Gender Trouble. If we accept the argument of the mas- sively infl uential Gender Trouble that the ‘sex’ that would supposedly be represented, mediated or imagined through cultural fi gures of gender is actually always fi gured as other than gender, then we…

tions which often implicate their embodied being; the person experiences herself as looked at in certain ways, described in her physical being in certain ways, she experiences the bodily reactions of others to her, and she reacts to them. The diverse phenomena that have come under the rubric of “gender” in feminist theory can be redescribed in the idea of lived body as some among many forms of bodily habitus and interac- tions with others that we enact and experience. In such redescription we ﬁnd that Butler is right in at least this respect: it is a mystiﬁcation to attribute the ways of being associated with the category “gender” to some inner core of identity of a subject, whether understood as “natu- ral” or acquired. In a recent essay Linda Nicholson similarly proposes that feminist and queer theory focus on the sociohistorical differentiation of bodies as lived, rather than maintain…

women, she argues that norms concerning gender are continually chang- ing and do not confer on women any common identity or experience. Moreover, she denies that sex difference is more fundamental than other differences, construing it merely as a transient artefact of these shifting gender norms. Despite these advantages, Butler’s thought is problematic in that her stress on the cultural production of sex and gender privileges culture over matter and nature. A viable synthesis of her thought with that of Irigaray must therefore considerably revise Butler’s thought too, speciﬁcally (I will argue) by predicating Butler’s claims on the idea that bodies do have a natural character, but one of multiplicity. By this, I mean that each body is naturally composed of multiple forces (pre-conscious impulses to pursue particular kinds of activity), where this character of multiplicity is universally…

ping social phenomena. In practice, this difference does not always mean very much. Judith Butler’s work, for example, is generally considered to be queer – indeed, her 1990 book Gender Trouble is often cited as one of queer theory’s inaugural acts. However, her argument that our bodies, sexualities and identities are articulated and produced through what she calls the ‘heterosexual matrix’ owes much to the writings of radical femi- nists like Rich and Wittig (as Butler herself acknowledges). One point of lasting disagreement, however, does stand out: whereas radical feminism continues to maintain that certain kinds of sexualities and identities – such as butch-femme lesbians, transexuals, drag queens, and sex workers who claim to enjoy what they do – conserve and perpetuate some of the most pernicious dimensions of heteropatriarchy, queer theory, in stark contrast, foregrounds those sam…

the subject, but also on what, in the very act of construction, necessarily ends up falling outside the subject: Thus, we also have abject bodies, “bod- ies that (do not) matter.” In her book Bodies that Matter, Butler is at great pains to correct the misreadings of her earlier book, Gender Trouble, espe- cially the criticism that the performative of gender means that gender is somehow chosen and donned like a costume by a conscious subject (Bod- ies that Matter x). Rather, gender, sex, the body itself, are constructed at Performance, Autopsy, and the Performative 51

der melancholy connected with the practice of gender performance? To answer this question, Butler has recourse to the psychoanalytic category of “acting out” (agieren). In transvestism, she states, an unful- filled longing is reflected in the mimetic annexation of the gender iden- tity of the other sex. For that reason, one suspects it is precisely this longing that is acted out in the transvestite performance: the repudiated (foreclosed) identification with the opposite sex/gender. As acting out, this performance in turn points to the problem of the unacknowledged, unmourned loss. The transvestite performance incorporates this loss and takes the place of the grief. In her gender theory, Judith Butler focuses less on the acquisition of one’s own gender and much more on the reverse, the repudiation of the opposite sex/gender associated with that acquisition. Both “masculinity” and “femininity” are formed and consolidated through

Judith Butler (1956–) 79 used to denote an utterance that is also an enactment; where, that is, saying something is also its doing (as in ‘I promise’). As used by Butler in Gender Trouble, however, performativity is conceived less as a linguistic phenomenon (a speech act) than a form of corporeal enactment. One of the goals of Gender Trouble is to problematise feminist understandings of the relation between sex and gender and, in particular, the emphasis of ‘French Feminism’ on sexual dif- ference.5 Developed initially to contest the idea of biology as destiny, the distinction between sex and gender allowed feminists to contend that whereas sex (the biological differences between men and women) is ﬁ xed gender is not. Because it is culturally constructed, it can be altered. This, in turn, means that gender hierarchies (the patriarchal privileging of men) can be assailed. Butl…

Braiterman See also: antitheodicy; Jewish Philosophy BUTLER, JUDITH (1956– ) American philosopher working in fem- inist and queer theory, psychoanalysis and continental philosophy, known for her work on gender, sexuality, power and identity. In Gender Trouble (1990) – considered one of the central texts in queer theory – Butler advances the performative model of gender, whereby the categories ‘male’ and ‘female’ are understood to be the consequence of the repetition of certain acts instead of natural or necessary categories. Arguing against the essentialist assumption that certain gendered behaviour is natural, Butler claims instead that it is the culturally informed performance of certain gendered roles that gives rise to identity.…

in which achieved gender status is a fiction rather than an absolute state supported by fic- tion, which is the case in the work of Beauvoir. It is thus that Judith Butler, again a philosopher by education and professional affiliation and again a writer whose work moves (as many of her critics have pointed out) rapidly from theo- retical assertion to engagements with the ‘real’ world that various writers have found problem- atic, suggests a way through the various confines that binary accounts of gender implicitly offer. The punctuation that explicitly challenges straightforward assumptions of the way in which we read ‘the real’ is to indicate an essential part of Butler’s argument: that the real world is no more or less than our capacity to re-affirm or to destabilize it.

Gender as performance: Judith Butler 105 Butler’s alternative gender model Butler puts forward an alternative view of our gendered identities that can be summed up as follows: • Our genders are culturally rather than naturally formed. Butler tells us that our biological anatomies do not determine our genders. The normalisation of heterosexuality is established, she further argues, as a result of long-­standing social rituals that orien­ tate us towards traditional male and female roles.

cauldian concept of the disciplinary body has produced the notion of perfor­ mativity - as distinct from the less nuanced term performance - to explain how the deployments of the body through acts and gestures, especially in terms of gendered sexuality, are, through a process of reiteration, productive of a discursive identity that is both open and constrained. And although in Gender Trouble (1990) her emphasis is relatively limited to sexual difference, she goes on to develop the idea in a wider field. As Butler sees it, a whole range of normative binaries that are used to characterise embodiment - male/female, health/ill-health, heterosexual/homosexual, black/white and so on - may be exposed in their instability - but also paradoxically confirmed - by the performativity of abject bodies. The precariousness of all bodies is exposed by paying attention to their 'constitutive ou…

CHAPTER THREE « From Performance to Performatives 73 up the idea of gender as a performance, Bornstein focuses on the fun one can have with it. Just as one can play King Lear in different ways, so, too, can one play gender in different ways: as a serious self-expression, as a campy RuPaul drag routine, or as a medley of different gender exhibitions, Finally, Butler pushes performance in a performative direction by ques- tioning the mode of being of the “one” who is playing King Lear or a spe- cific gender. For Butler, the expressions of gender produce or construct the gendered subject so that talk of a material body, a sex, behind the expres- sions of gender makes no sense. We have also considered the effect on fem- inism of this trajectory from performance to performative construction. Butler tries to rescue feminism by turning it into a resignifying subversion of gender norms. Nussbaum remains her harshest critic. For her, Butler

ﬁlings, running and jumping with iron rods attached to his legs. These images provide a clear, since ampliﬁed, instance of the process by which a gendered identity is constituted through the necessary act of imagining, as well as resisting, bodily boundaries. We identify with a masculine identity that is con- stituted before our eyes, enacted through these narrative images of physical hardening. Judith Butler takes up this point when she suggests that ‘the body is not a “being,” but a variable boundary, a surface whose permeability is politically regulated.’ Butler sees the body as ‘a signifying practice within a cultural ﬁeld of gender hierarchy and compulsory heterosexuality,’ but the purchase of her analysis can also be extended in order to think about the racial constitution of the body (Gender Trouble 139). The symbolic centrality of a rhetoric of hardness in the martial arts ﬁlms ﬁ…

club, animating all of its dynamics and fueling its current cultural impact. Butler, in her inﬂuential 1990 book Gender Trouble, develops the notion of gender as per- formance, or as what she also calls a style or a strategy.5 Gender, whether mascu- line or feminine, does not exist as a ﬁxed essence or natural identity that we then express respectively as a man or woman. It is not something given, a biological condition that determines a person’s identity. According to Butler, gender has no preexisting, natural, or ﬁxed meaning; there is no primary or interior gendered core to our personhood. This notion of an “abiding gendered self” is, she argues, an illusion, a chimera, a fantasy. From this perspective, gender is a fantasy in the Where Fantasy Becomes Reality • 81

gender identity is “disciplinary,” Butler asserts, in that it exists to regulate sexu- ality; it limits, coerces, and punishes people into living out gender in very narrowly deﬁned and tightly controlled ways. Woe to those who fail to “do” their gender right. Butler wants to “trouble,” or to question and disrupt, any and all compulsory norms around gender and sexuality: that reproductive heterosexuality is the ideal, that gays and lesbians are “unnatural,” that men can’t cry, that women must shave under their arms or else it’s “nasty” (as one my students puts it, with a shudder). To return to my question of whether stripping can be subversive of patriarchy, Butler offers with her notion that gender is a performance, not simply a redeﬁnition and a critique of the problems of gender identity, but also a solution. According to Butler, excess repetition and parody can disrupt or subvert gender norms. She defends drag, for example, as a “subversive bodily act,” as a performance that

However, her politics of subversion and resistance differs from Nietzsche (or Lacan), although it might be seen as a part of the ven- erable tradition of left Nietzscheanism. A tension exists in Butler between the implied voluntarism of gen- der as performance and her emphasis on the extent to which subjects are formed through regulation and coercion. In Bodies that Matter, Butler acknowledges the constraints that limit the possibilities for self- invention. In particular, she maintains that performance is “reitera- tive and citational,” not self-determining. In The Psychic Life of Power, Butler continues to engage this issue by dwelling on the relation between power and agency. Power does not merely act on us, since it enacts us into being. Power and agency are bidirectional; they can function in alliance, although this is not necessarily the case. Whereas in Gender Trouble Butler interrogates the concept of identity and asks

nating against the experiences and realities of some. Moreover, as Judith Butler demonstrates in “Gender Trouble, Feminist Theory, and Psychoan- alytic Discourse,” the dangers are not only that of shutting out the experi- ences of women not white, Western, middle-class and of the late twentieth century, but of constructing notions of self-identity which are implicitly heterosexist. A central thesis of Judith Butler’s essay is that gender identity is a regulative ideal which fundamentally assists the norm of heterosexuality. Psychoanalytic theory, in its diverse forms, including object relations theory and Lacanian and post-Lacanian theory, aids this regulative pro- cess. Such theory both “confers a false sense of legitimacy and universality to a culturally specific, and, in some contexts, culturally oppressive, version of gender identity” and contributes to the heterosexual ideal by intertwining gender identity and sexual orientation:

attainability for an audience remains one of the key problematics at the heart of studies of representation. Since the early days of feminism’s Second Wave, ‘gender’ had been understood as a construct where preferred forms of feminin- ity and masculinity were endorsed by social and ideological sanctions on abnormality in behaviours and attitudes. By the 1990s femi- nist critics were heeding Judith Butler’s advice to consider ‘[w]hat new shape of politics emerges when identity as a common ground no longer constrains the discourse on feminist politics’ (Butler, 1990: ix). Butler raised fundamental questions about what we are talking about when we discuss gender and identity, and her description of gender as performative, a constant re-enactment (or resistance) of dominant patriarchal para- digms, underscores her argument that ‘if there is something right in Beauvoir’s claim that one is not born, but rather becomes a woman, it follows that woman itself is a term

the effect of destabilising ‘the very “subjects” that it hopes to represent and liberate’ (Butler 1990: 5). Queer art Efforts to situate and assess Butler’s proposal of a ‘variable construction of identity’ in the context of contemporary gender politics have been most successful in the domain of queer theory. Although Gender Trouble is framed principally in feminist terms, it has lent prestige to and has become perhaps the most inﬂuential book in this area. Derived in part from Butler’s proposal that gender is ‘performative’, ‘queer’ has been theorised, not as an alternative sexual identity so much as a critique of identity. Annamarie Jagose explained queer’s transformation from being a term of abuse or slang. In recent years ‘queer’ has come to be used differently, sometimes as an umbrella term for a coalition of culturally marginal sexual self-iden- tiﬁcations and at other times to describe a nascent theoretical model

experience nor its institutional forms.”6 Sex is understood as penis, vagina, testicles, estrogen, and they all have nothing to do with politics. Gender is, according to this account, “everything else,” that is, a system of social sig- nification and semiotic formation. Taking a different stand than Rubin, Judith Butler read Simone de Beau- voir’s axiom “one is not born a woman, but one becomes a woman” not as a call to alleviate the female reproductive function, but as a battle for gender. For Butler, gender is an identity that both precedes the self at birth and is gradually acquired. But for Butler, while sex is an invariant factual aspect of the body, what concerns feminism is the acculturation of that body. The distinction between sex and gender serves to attribute the value of the social functions of women to biological necessity, and to cease to refer credibly to gendered…

and sexuality.4 Since then, Butler has been active in gay and lesbian human rights campaigns, chairing the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission; protested about afﬁ rmative action; and spoken out against gay marriage. Her ongoing politi- cal involvement has not been limited to queer or feminist issues, however. Butler has also been critical of US involvement in the Iraq War, of events at both Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, as well as intervening in debates on Zionism and on the Palestinian- Israeli conﬂ ict. As such, the caricature of her as the apolitical theorist that some critics draw is clearly ill deserved. Sex/Gender/Sexuality as Performative The idea for which Butler is best known is undoubtedly that of gender performativity, which is given its most extensive treatment in her second book Gender Trouble.

By this we mean individual or collective subjects who are faced with a ﬁ eld of possibilities in which several ways of behaving, several reactions and diverse comportments may be realized” (“Subject” 221). Judith Butler is perhaps the most inﬂ uential theorist to explore the idea of sexual and gender identity as a social PERFORMANCE, a site of power and discourse. “To what extent,” she asks, “do regulatory practices of gender formation and division constitute identity, the internal coher- ence of the subject, indeed, the self-identical status of the person?” (Gender Trouble 16). As an alternative to such naturalized regulatory practices, she developed a model of PERFORMATIVITY, which she distin- guished from a normative model of PE…

FEMINIST PHILOSOPHIES A–Z 109 In feminist philosophy Judith Butler is the most well recognised queer theorist. Her book Gender Trouble (1990) has not only served as a foundational text in queer theory, it has evoked a substantial amount of discussion and criticism in queer theory and feminist theory. Butler argues in her book Undoing Gender (2004) that ‘queer theory is understood, by deﬁnition, to oppose all iden- tity claims, including sex assignment’ (7). Some feminists worry that queer theory is dangerous for feminist theory because they claim it makes it difﬁcult to study women and gender as analytical categories. See essentialism; gender and sex; social construction R Race: race theorists Michael Omi and Howard Winant in their book Racial Formation in the United States (1994) deﬁne race as ‘a concept which signiﬁes and symbolizes social conﬂicts and interests by referring to different types of human bodies’ (55).

and normativity generally in their writing. They see normative concerns so woven into the fabric of our lives and our situation that they find no need to offer a distinct and isolated ethical position. Whether it is a question of feminism and the concerns of patriarchy, the environment, art and aesthetics, the politics of postmodernism, or even science studies, the normative impact and consequences of one’s thought and one’s views are inseparable aspects of many of the philosophers whose work is canvassed throughout this volume. In the opening essay of the volume, “Rethinking Gender,” Gayle Salamon traces the recent history of feminist thought, particularly as it appears in the work of Judith Butler. Butler’s has been one of the most influential voices in recent years, particularly in feminist and queer theory. Her identity politics, however, is not essentialist in character. In fact, it is precisely the opposite. As Salamon points out, “Butler rethinks gender by

larly to Judith Butler’s comment on gender drag: In such perceptions in which an ostensible reality is coupled with an unreality, we think we know what the reality is, and take the secondary appearance of gender to be mere artifice, play, falsehood, and illusion. But what is the sense of “gender reality” that founds this perception in this way? Perhaps we think we know what the anatomy of the person is (sometimes we do not, and we certainly have not appreciated the varia­ tion that exists at the level of anatomical description). Or we derive that knowledge from the clothes that the person wears, or how the clothes are worn. This is naturalized knowledge, even though it is based on a series of cultural inferences, some of which are highly erroneous. butler, Gender Trouble xxii What Butler pinpoints is the fact that in drag we assume that the reality be­ hind the performance, accor…

in. "Identifications are never fully and finally made; they are inces- santly reconstituted and, as such, are subject to the volatile logic of iter- ability" (1993, 105). In this sense, she reads the heteronormative order as a defense against sexual ambiguity. Society designates as abject those who threaten the cultural order it ordains when it insists that there are only two sexes, male and female, and only two genders, mas- culinity and femininity. The causal lines of heteronormative desire require that unambiguously male bodies underlie masculine gender and con- strue themselves as desiring subjects in relation to unambiguously female bodies that underlie feminine bodies. By asking whether the "undelineated figures" of "feminized 'fag' and the phallicized 'dyke'" are "structuring absences of symbolic demand" (1993, 103), Butler points to the way in which the psychoanalytic imaginary conforms to a heteronor-

These normative notions preclude recognition of our common corpo- real vulnerability, and their subversion is justiﬁed because it enables this recognition. For Butler, then, bodies are vulnerable to the social norms which can mould them in hurtful ways. Such norms are hurtful not because they pre- vent bodies from existing in their inherent, natural, forms, but because they constitute bodies which can be lived and inhabited only in endemi- cally contorted and painful ways. For example, traditional ways of treating the intersexed presume not only that certain bodies are intersexed but also that intersex is an aberration and that intersexed individuals must be forced to assume a sex, by being forced to perform the gender which will mould their body into an (at least approximately) male or female form.46 Thus, the norms which shape intersexed bodies instil an inherent expe- rience of physic…

10 i n t r o d u c t i o n social relations—for instance, the SM “Scene” in New York City—the dun- geon provides a relatively circumscribed arena in which to explore broader social mechanisms. In considering the prospect that sadomasochism has implications beyond the sexual sphere, it is useful to draw a parallel with Judith Butler’s work on the practice of drag. Drag is a kind of theater in which gender display be- comes both exaggerated and denaturalized. Butler contends that drag “re- veals the distinctness of those aspects of gendered experience which are falsely naturalized as a unity through the regulatory ﬁ ction of heterosexual coherence. In imitating gender, drag implicitly reveals the imitative structure of gender itself—as well as its contingency” (1999, 175; emphasis in original). She goes on to argue, “Although the gender meanings taken up in these parodic styles ar…

276 Chapter 13 Butler’s work has garnered considerable attention for its espousal of the notion that gender is constituted by performance. This idea was read as sounding the final death knell of cultural feminism and thereby ushering in a kind of paradigm shift for feminist philosophy. In Butler’s own words (1990, p. 33): “. . . gender is a repeated styliza- tion of the body, a set of repeated acts within a highly rigid regulatory frame that congeals over time to produce an appearance of sub- stance, of a natural sort of being.” She proceeds to contest the “com- pulsive heterosexuality” of our culture, which she sees as distorting the experience of heterosexuals as well as oppressing homosexuals. Butler’s concern here with the construction of identity and with the violent imposition of culture on the body reveal the influence of Foucault and his Nietzsche interpretation. In Gender Trouble, Butler describes her project as a “feminist geneal-

those desires, who demonstrate complex understandings of what is at stake in the risky business of female agency. From Sidney’s Pamela to Brontë’s Jane Eyre, we are interested in the continuing fascination with women who are more than passive ideal types or demonized sexual aggressors. One of our interests, then, is in exploring the ways that selected texts demonstrate an awareness of the difﬁculties for women in expressing their desires. Far from being ‘natural’, essential or unproblematically given, the experience of being female is ‘constituted’, as Judith Butler puts it, ‘through discursively constrained performative acts.’5 The per- formance of gender, Butler argues, ‘must be understood not as a singu- lar or deliberative “act”, but, rather, as the reiterative and citational practice by which discourse produces the effects that it names.’6 What has often been seen as an ‘origin and cause’ of identity categories

only to economic distribution and class power but also to sexuality, gender, species, and much else besides. In her later work, Judith Butler argues for the kind of attentiveness to the asymmetry between discourses that we have in view here. “It seems crucial,” she writes, “to resist the model of power that would set up racism and misogyny and homophobia as parallel or analogi- cal relations,” because such a model “delays the important work of thinking through the ways in which these vectors of power require and deploy each other for the purpose of their own articulation.”7 The unevenness of social discourses is ideologically productive, in other words, and it is therefore crucial, as we shall see, that in a project like The Si- lence of the Lambs the discourses of gender and class—or, in another register, psychoanalysis and aestheticism—all remain in play, powerful in their own right. Our argument, then, is that these discourses “deploy each other” in an

Women’s Studies 2004) At least since Judith Butler’s seminal book Gender Trouble, published in 1990, feminist and gender studies have been concerned with how new conceptions of the body affect and reform disciplinary questions in the humanities, as well as to some extent in the natural and social sciences. (Nora 2002) Butler ‘‘pushes’’ feminist thought forward, ‘‘refuses’’ to get caught in the traps of a focus on ‘‘women’’ that mark earlier periods of feminist theoriz- ing and politics, rejects an essentialist view of the body or the social as outside discourse, and carries academic feminism into a new era. Because of Butler, feminist theory now has the epistemological and methodological tools to deconstruct or ‘‘revise’’ previous understandings of ‘‘power, poli- tics, and subjective agency’’ and to take its own history as object of inquiry. In such accounts, Butler is positioned as critiquing both the ‘‘foundational

understand the images they manufacture, and that we cannot assume that these images of women are universal and somehow separate from political and culture forces. These early explora- tions of woman as image also led to discussions of femininity as image, not biologically but cultur- ally deﬁned, thus allowing analysis of the femi- nine ideal as separate from real women. This separation of biological sex and socially con- structed gender laid the foundation for the later work of Judith Butler in Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (1990) and Marjorie Garber’s Vested Interests: Cross Dressing and Cultural Anxiety (1992) in questioning what IS this thing we call “woman.” These critics argued that gender is a social construct, a performance that can be learned by people who are biologically male, female, or transgendered, and therefore should not be used as the only esse…

precisely the gender stereotypes that best suit the organisa- tion of labour in an industrial capitalist society. The separation of the sexes described by French feminism appears to Chodorow to serve conservative political and economic ends. Resistance to the feminist separation that is the conclusion of French feminism, with the écriture féminine that is its subject, has been found both in France and in the work of influential American feminists. Among the most influential of these American feminists is Judith Butler, whose 1990 book Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity set out an approach that has since become known as ‘cultural’ or ‘postmodern’ feminism. Butler begins by explaining the significance of the term ‘trouble’ in her title. For men, as the subject of desire, ‘trouble’ is represented by the female ‘object’ of desire who unexpect- edly returns and answers the masculine gaze, who refuses the passive position of the feminine object and thereby ‘contests

This approach mirrors Carter’s credo that life itself is a performance and there is ultimately no distinction between authentic and inauthentic selves. In this respect Carter’s representation anticipates the work of Judith Butler, whose influential work Gender Trouble was published towards the end of Carter’s life. Butler’s notion of gender performativity resonates with Carter’s many masquerading, shape-shifting selves and with the cross-dressing protagonists of Carter’s successors like Waters, Smith and Winterson. Mother-daughter relations are a key aspect of the exploration of female identity in

and that pornographic images of women in the fashion industry underpin and support the basic patriarchal power relations which continue to control men and women” (Turner 1996: 27). As I consider consensual ‘SM’ as hav- ing the potential to be a ‘practice of resistance’, located not only within the innovative ‘body practices’ but also within the use of the traditional modes of ‘power’ (discourses as well as ‘body practices’) itself, my work will often refer to Judith Butler’s (1990, 1993, 2004, 2005) work. Inspired by Foucault’s works, Butler suggests the performative disruption of the ‘order of things’ as possible resistance. She points out that ‘gender’ as well as ‘sexuality’ only emerge through repetitive performances and, thus, through the course of time: “... produce the appearance of substance, of a natural sort of being”

Introduction 9 her. However, it is important to recognise that Butler’s project had many ante­ cedents – notably, Michel Foucault’s work on sexuality and power (Foucault 1976), Luce Irigaray’s interrogation of sexual difference (Irigaray 1985) and Joan Rivière’s concept of ‘masquerade’ (1929) (which foreshadows Butler’s own focus on ‘gender as performance’) – as well as the wider post-structuralist movement in general. The last had particular ramifications for feminism, on account of the ways in which Ferdinand de Saussure’s and Jacques Derrida’s linguistic theories, together with Jacques Lacan’s psychoanalysis, came together to destabilise the concept of the individual (now refigured as a ‘subject’ of combined linguistic, cultural and psychoanalytic forces); while this radical challenge to humanist thought was welcomed by some for its deconstruction of what Lacan referred to …

deﬁnitions are simply accepted; on the contrary, there are constant battles over sexual meanings at individual and collective levels, and there are different types of masculinities – hegemonic, subordinate, marginalized – which shift over time, as they respond to changing pressures and struggles. But the battles are against, and within the limits set, by the dominant terms. These in turn are encoded via a social privileging of particular relationships – in marriage and family arrangements and a host of other social institutions and activities, through which gender, and sexual, identities are constructed and constantly reaffirmed and performed. Gender and sexuality, therefore, are less the expressions of some underlying truths about human nature. They are things we do in deﬁned situations, things we do over and over again, small acts incessantly repeated, productions which, as Judith Bu…

audience, and Simonsen argues that this direct address is characteristic of a new theatrical genre that eschews both conventional realism and Brechtian alienation in its aesthetic politics, and which here works to encourage the audience to assume responsibility for the precarious conditions the play describes. Bodies As I have already argued, the body – or, more precisely, the need to think the body differently – is central to Judith Butler’s account of precariousness. To say that life is precarious’, she writes, ‘is to say that the possibility of being sustained relies fundamentally on social and political conditions, and not only on a postulated internal drive to live’ (Frames 14). Yet the recognition of this shared precariousness is hindered by dominant ‘masculinist’ conceptions of embodiment, which picture ‘individual bodies as completely distinct from one another’ (‘Rethinking’ 16). When bodies are imagined as controllable and self-contained, vulnerability and

In doing so I am following Judith Butler's notion of the critically queer where a certain performance of gender (drag for her, Narcissus for me) magnifies "the regulated productions of hyperbolic versions of 'man' and 'woman.'" For Butler, "The resignification of norms is thus a function of their inefficacy, and so the question of subversion, of working the weakness in the norm, becomes a matter of inhabit- ing the practices of its rearticulation" (1993, 237). By this practice, to reflect Narcissus is to place him not only at the phallicized center of a male cultural hierarchy where the male image is glorified (and it does do that; Narcissus is a queer man, and I don't apologize for my attraction to phalluses); it is also to place him within a specular optic that submits his phallic oneness to division, multiplication, and a…

contestation and sometimes negation, a site of multiple discourses at the nexus of cultural and social intersections through which it articu- lates and is articulated, a body suspended in difference and in perpetual becoming. This book is thus concerned with how the plural forms of female subjectivity that have been apparent in recent women’s writing in French impact upon figurations of corporeality. In thinking through ‘the becoming of the body’, it might be helpful to invoke the word ‘transformation’. No longer concerned with the mere reappropria- tion and reinhabiting of historically silenced and excluded voices and bodies, these four writers share a common interest in the radical recon- ceptualisation of the female body. What is particularly striking about their works is that they appear to move beyond the cultural resignifica- tion called for by the second wave, and through the discursive itera- tions of gender signalled by queer theorists such as Judith Butler, to

presupposition of the cultural process of gendering that brings a body into being, by engendering it. Body’s capacity to take a shape through the repeti- tion of the gender norms gives rise to a body that would be intelligible or unintelligible within certain gender regimes. In opposing the mind-body du- alism of the metaphysics of subjectivity, Butler redefines the body as nothing else than an outcome of its encounter with culture. There is no free subject that shapes its body by freely choosing the gender norms that are already available to it in culture, for the corporeal being is always already produced by gender. The question arises if the body is not, therefore, entirely sub- merged in a cultural determinism in which its possibility of being otherwise is foreclosed. Butler finds the possibility of resistance and change by the coming into being of agency and through its performances that play with gender norms.

plications of this construction of femininity and the body for readings of Judith Butler and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick. 47 Judith Butler describes this as the ‘‘morphological imaginary,’’ in Bodies That Matter, 57–92. Her analysis, though, focuses primarily on the materialization of the phallus in the penis. Moraga’s work suggests the range and scope of a speciﬁ- cally butch morphological imaginary, which foregrounds the symbolic signiﬁ- cance of the body’s surfaces or boundaries. Furthermore, her images emphasize the materiality of the discursive, which interests Butler but is ultimately given less attention than the discursivity of the material. The inﬂuence of Catholicism on Moraga’s interest in the materializations of the immaterial (or spiritual) is not to be underestimated. For more on the lesbian erotics of surfaces, see Eliza- beth Grosz, Volatile Bodies: Toward a Corporeal Feminism …

Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire, Episte- mology o f the Closet, and most recently Tendencies, is their collective challenge to the silent presumption that identities wholly correspond to identifications and that sexuality is a seamless, monolithic, unfractured whole. Sedgwick’s sustained interest in the myriad and complex ways sexuality is experienced by different subjects goes a long way towards demonstrating the momentousness of the psychoanalytic insight, “to identify as must always include multiple processes of identification with.”19 This same premise provides the theoretical foundation of Judith Butler’s Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion o f Identity and Bodies That Matter, where the field of psychical identifications becomes a suggestive critical vantage point from which to examine the practice and theory of identity politics.

female but intersexual, transsexual, transgendered, also destabi- lizes the narrative of modernity. Here gender assignment is also a way of keeping intact the ruling political binaries. When gender begins to drift, when the contingency of the body can no longer be contained within the deconstructive terms of Gender Trouble or the aporias of Bodies That Matter, what occurs in Butler’s thought is a fateful inflection of gender in the direction of an ethics of kin- ship (Antigone’s Claim), moral philosophy (Giving an Account of Oneself), predatory power (The Psychic Life of Power), melancholic subjectivity (Precarious Life), and interpellation (Excitable Speech). In her thought, bodily contingency drift is rendered fully, both in detail and definition.

practice of improvisation within a scene of constraint,” and for Butler the question of gender involves two different kinds of inquiry.11 The first is a description of the limits of intelligibility that constitute the borders of gender, and attention to how that constitution designates some subjects as livable and marks others as abject. Butler emphasizes the mutually constituting nature of these different positions, where that which is unassimilable to the domain of proper gender must still persist as a necessary and structuring ideal, giving coherence and boundedness to the category that excludes it. Her discussions of gender melancholia, most fully explicated in The Psychic Life of Power, describe just this structure, whereby those homosexual attachments that must be repudiated in order for the subject to achieve normative sexuality (and also gender) remain alive and stubbornly held at the heart of heterosexuality.

here, I think). ‘Denying the womanliness of women speaking in public was a familiar ploy’, Nell Irvin Painter writes: ‘Hostile audi¬ ences questioned the sexual identity of American women preach¬ ers like Harriet Livermore, of lecturers like the antislavery poet Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, and of actresses like Rachel, the great French tragedian’ (139). In response to the challenge, I am inspired to say this by my reading of Cavell’s ‘Austin and Examples’ in The. Claim of Reason 49-64.

are ideological, but they are also real. Stephen is doomed to experience her own body as essentially unlovable; the reasons for this failure are crushingly specific-her sense of failure and longing has everything to do with being a mannish woman before the war in rural, quasi­ aristocratic England. And yet this does not mean that a change in cir­ cumstances would render Stephen perfectly happy, perfectly satisfied. Despite our present sense of expanding possibilities for gendered em­ bodiment, the melancholic trace in Stephen's experience of herself is im­ possible to wish away.24 Unwanted Being The relationship between gender formation and loss is at the heart of Judith Butler's work on the melancholy of gender. In the introduction to The Psychic Life of Power, Butler underscores the crucial role of loss in subject formation and the assumption of gender: Is there a loss that cannot be thought, cannot be owned or grieved,

analyse their fictional appearances in art and literature, investigate multiple manifestations of the human in its intersection with the machine, while at the same time analysing the implications of this intersection for the already performative nature of our gendered bodies; as Blackmann notes, posthuman “bodies are being done and enacted within biotechnological and some digital practices in ways that disrupt or disturb the boundaries between human and machine” (118). The body becomes a locus of play as it tries to create its identity as a posthuman one, and representations of this play are studied as found in literature, art and media. The masculine/​feminine binary is interlocked with the human/​posthuman binary, and as Butler argues for drag as a play that ex­ poses and thus dismantles the feminine/​masculine binary, these texts present us with the posthuman in its ability …

Judith Butler Excitable Speech (London: Routledge 1997) Judith Butler has herself generated a great deal of excitable speech: Gender Trouble and Bodies That Matter1 brought forth critical reactions ranging from the ‘bad reader’2 who felt thereby authorised to reduce gender to a choice, to the critics who denounced the density of her work as politically useless.3 Now she has published a book of that name. Excitable Speech revisits the contingent ground of performativity through the work of J.L.Austin, and thereby functions somewhat as an archaeology of her previous works. Here Butler is driven to a greater degree of explication of her theoretical debts and methodology in an effort perhaps to halt further misappropriation, which is faintly ironic given the emphasis of her work on the necessity of re-signification. At the level of both content and form, however, she is anxious to ratify the…

category of analysis – next to race, gender and class – and in its insistence that sexuality and gender cannot very well be separated.’ (Literary Theory, 1992). Judith Butler The American critic Judith Butler, in an essay entitled Imitation and Gender Insubordination (1991), uses the word ‘queer’ as in the sense of the idiom ‘to queer someone’s pitch’ (spoil or ruin a plan). She sees the essential function of queer theory to be to thwart, disrupt and generally make certain things impossible, whether it be prevailing ideologies or sexual stereotypes. In the same work, she is concerned to deconstruct the notion of ﬁxed personal identity. She believes the ‘I’ appears to be a ﬁxed identity only because we repeat it so many times. So also, she says, sexual orientation might be the result of repetition of DAVID CARTER 128

Distributed in its multiplicity of movements, disseminated by the dis- course of poststructuralism, the decisive outlines of this body become hazy. The residues of an unproblematized, ﬁxed Nature subdivided into smooth modern bodies break down. Early in this process, Luce Irigaray, exploring the folds of a ‘‘sensible transcendental,’’ began to seek a spiri- tual ﬂesh of the feminine, ﬁnding clues in medieval mystics.6 On another path, Judith Butler early recognized the self-implicating elusiveness of the object of Bodies That Matter: ‘‘What about the materiality of the body, Judy?’’ When ‘‘woman’’ becomes ‘‘a permanent site of contest,’’ we are on the way of an aporia.7 Yet this contest offers no relief from the need to act, from—pace Derrida—the necessity of deciding. Thus the later But- ler, in afﬁnity with the Hegelian negativity, theorizes ‘‘moments of un- knowingness’’ about oneself…

who have utilised Derridean deconstructive methods. She is famous for her theory of performativity and for her political thoughts on precariousness and grievability, enabling nuanced explorations of gender and love, especially for marginalised identities. In Gender Trouble (1990; second edition 1999 with a new preface), Butler applies insights from Foucault and Derrida to argue that, contrary to popular thinking, biological assumptions about sex are not “given,” but constructed and naturalised, just as much as cultural gender roles, in ac- cordance with the needs of a society to regulate itself in discursive ways. Butler did not share the enthusiasm of différance feminists about access to multiplici- ties of meaning prior to discursive signification. She realised that these multi- plicities would amount to a constitutive “outside” to social-discursive con- structions that she, fol…

of thought. While each writer may have begun with a specific problematic—gender construction for Butler, the entwinement of cybernetics and feminism for Haraway, and the paradoxical status of order and chaos for Hayles—the thematics of all three have increasingly converged on critical analysis of different bodily inflections in contemporary society. Breaking with her previous engagement with “bodies that mat- ter” and “gender trouble,” Butler has refocused her thought on the problem of grievability, or, more to the point, absence of grievability, in contemporary subjectivity. Here the dark politics of the global war on terror seems to have inspired on Butler’s part an internal shift in her thinking, away from a preoccupation with the signify- ing regimes of heterosexual normativity to a deeper reflection on a
