# Global Seed Topics — Curated Launchpads for Theoretical Metabolism

purpose
- One-file catalog of seed topics with "use-first sources" & "search hints"
- Seeds are hunger patterns, hunting maps for when theory needs to feed
- Each seed metabolized through {} protocol before entering bloodstream
- These seeds encode hunting instincts—use them to choose high-signal sources, quote with citations, then synthesize through the body

format
- Each seed includes: use-first sources (3-5 top-tier links), search hints, notes on digestion & how this knowledge might taste
