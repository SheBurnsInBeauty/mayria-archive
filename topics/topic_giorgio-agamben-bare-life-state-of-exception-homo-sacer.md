to injury by [our] fellow men,” to be “false and ignominious,” he speculates that it is probably of recent origin, “the last mistaken attempt of the weakened West- ern tradition to seek the saint it has lost in cosmological impenetrability.”19 In Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, Giorgio Agamben follows up on Benjamin’s suggestion by tracking the emergence of this dogma, wherein bare life, or life itself denuded of any political form or “protective covering,” is deemed sa- cred. Whereas in classical Greece, bios (a form of life, or way of living, deﬁned within the political sphere) could be, and systematically was, distinguished from zoe (the simple fact of life, common to animals, men, and gods), in modern society, he ar- gues, bios and zoe became conﬂated, making bare, biological life the very matter of modern politics. Agamben thus adopts Foucault’s thesis that in the middle …

punishment. In that Binding/Hache conception Giorgio Agamben spies out resuscitation and an updated, modern articulation of the ancient category of homo sacer: of a human who can be killed without fear of punishment but cannot be used in religious sacrifice; who in other words is exempted absolutely- standing beyond the confines of both human and divine law. Agamben also observes that the concept of 'life unworthy of being lived' is as the concept of homo sacer always was - non-ethical; but that in its modern rendition it acquires profound political significance as a category 'on which sovereign power is founded'. 133 Ill I.

who, in the words of Jean Améry, “was a staggering corpse, a bundle of physical functions in its last convulsions” (RA, 41). Neither human nor animal, neither zoe¯ nor bios, bare life is a life stripped of its form of life. At the end of Homo Sacer, Agamben offers what, as he himself acknowl- edges, may seem like an “extreme, if not arbitrary” (HS, 186) list of other ﬁ gures of bare life: “the Flamen Diale, one of the greatest priests of classi- cal Rome”; “the bandit”; “the Führer in the Third Reich”; “Wilson, the biochemist who decided to make his own body and life into a research

Introduction 3 One can no longer speak of rights and freedoms without encounter- ing the specter of the “terrorist” or without making allowances for a form of political existence which is excluded and/or excludes itself from the rule of law. The recent work of Giorgio Agamben posits sovereignty itself as an unconditional power over life and death which converts cer- tain modes of existence into “bare life”—life which is deﬁned through a ban, as in the case of the homo sacer (sacred man) who cannot be sacri- ﬁced, yet the act of killing him is unpunishable by law. It could be said that the life of the “terrorist” in this sense is “bare life” and represents an “extra-territorial threshold in which the human body is separated from its normal political status and abandoned ... in a state of exception.”9 Bare life exists at the limit point of freedom and sovereignty, reveal- ing the constitutive violence of law. Combining Agamben’s work with

Paul Hegarty 20 Those Who Can be Killed For Agamben, the problematic of death as other and death as the ultimate truth of humanity (as evidenced in the existence of lan- guage) plays out in the world of politics, law and social control. The ﬁ gure of homo sacer appears – he who can be killed, the one outside of society and deprived of humanity. Homo Sacer opens up Agamben’s long investigation into sovereignty as a limit condition of law, humanity, politics and the subject. The focus is on the idea of ‘bare life’, of a humanity stripped of nearly all of its deﬁ ning char- acteristics, which is at its most denuded in the Nazi concentration camps. Bare life is at its height in the ‘biopolitics’ of modernity, but, according to Agamben, it can and must be traced back throughout Western culture, to classical Greek and Roman law. Foucault writes of the biopoliticisation of life, notab…

This can explain some of the impatience - and, indeed, genuine bewilderment - with which Laclau treats the Homo Sacer project in his short, dismissive essay ‘Bare Life or Social Indeterminacy?’, where the social theorist claims Agamben’s method ‘is not sensitive enough to struc­ tural diversity’ (12). As I hope is becoming clear, I want to argue that this criticism is not wrong as much as it is beside the point. 31. Agamben, Remnants of Auschwitz, 69.

In his book Homo Sacer, Giorgio Agamben has written of a specific rela- tionship between sovereign power and a form of life that is constructed in a suspended space of exception. He writes: We shall give the name relation of exception to the extreme form of relation by which something is included solely through its exclusion. The figure that is included solely through its exclusion is what Agamben names “bare life”. This is a life that is “separated and excluded from itself—only a bare life”. The problem of the relationship between mad- ness and reason in the twentieth century commences with three dis- courses that revolve around this notion of an inclusive exclusion. Madness can only be understood and included within rational discourse through its exclusion as beyond the realm of understanding; as a form of bare life, an empty space that can only be marked by an absence. This is a peculiar beginning for a tradition. Ostensibly, the three dis-

16 A B A N D O N M E N T / B A N This “lupiﬁ cazione dell’uomo” (the “becoming-wolf” of man) and the concurrent “humanization” of the wolf, Agamben insists, is “at every moment possible” within the state of exception: “the transformation into a werewolf corresponds perfectly to the state of exception, during which [. . .] time the city is dissolved and men [sic] enter into a zone in which they are no longer distinct from beasts” (HS, 107; also O, 62). It is this very threshold, which is neither natural life nor social life but, rather, bare – or “sacred” – life that is “the always present and always operative presupposition of sovereignty” (HS, 107). The homo sacer, for Agamben (HS, 83), represents the “originary ﬁ gure of life taken into the sovereign ban”, as far as “the sovereign sphere is the sphere in which it is permitted to kill without committing homicide and without celebrating a sacriﬁ ce, and la vita sacra (sacred life) – that is, life

Chapter 3 8 GIORGIO AGAMBEN INTRODUCTION The range of interests of this Italian philosopher is extensive. Giorgio Agamben (b. 1942) works on Biblical textual criticism, medieval literature, holocaust literature, poetics, aesthetics, and political philosophy. The spectrum of his writing extends from the philosophy of language and literature, in works such as Stanzas: Word and Phantasm in Western Culture (1977) and The Idea of Prose (1985), to biopolitics, in books including Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (1995) and State of Exception (2005). But the two subject areas are not separate; it is not as if Agamben were moving from one specialism to another. Rather, both language and biopolitics are confronted by him as regions in which operations of inclusion and exclusion are at work, and it is the presuppositions which allow these operations to function that he seeks to draw out. Their overlapping concerns are

In Agamben’s case the question of animality is even more central to his theoretical work, as well as the object of one of his mono- graphs (The Open: Man and Animal (2004)). Starting with Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (1998), Agamben argued for the necessity of rethinking the binary oppositions into which Western metaphysics inevitably falls (and indeed metaphysics is nothing but the never-ending fall into these dualisms) – in particular, the dis- tinction between legal right/language on the one hand and ‘bare life’ on the other. The originality of Agamben’s thought consists precisely in its ability to show the myriad ways in which this dualism presents itself time and again. This dualism cannot be avoided, as it is constantly repeated by choosing one of its – inseparable and inter- dependent – poles. To choose the body, for example, as phenomenol- ogy sometimes seem…

Agamben, Giorgio The author of a number of books and articles on aesthetics, poetics, philology, the philosophy of language, and the relation between literature and philosophy, Giorgio Agamben (b. 1942) is one of the most insightful commentators on the aesthetic theo- ries of Martin Heidegger and Walter Benjamin. He is a gifted writer with broad interests, nuanced ideas, and vast erudition. These elements help explain why literary critics have dedicated such attention to Agamben, particularly given that it is from his work in po liti cal philosophy that he is best known. The works that brought Agamben fame as a po liti cal thinker— and, eventually, as an aesthetic one— form a series named for the book which began it, Homo Sacer, in which Agamben advances a number of controversial theses, chief among that “the concentration camp is the biopo liti cal paradigm of the modern age” (…

sacralized, by the discourses of power, as its essential aspect. Agamben, however, departs from Foucault and Benjamin by seeing this notion of bare life not simply as a rupture with previous thought but as the culmination of a gradual solidiﬁ- cation, throughout history, of the link between nude or bare life and sovereign power. Thus, when he declares, for example, that “Not simple natural life, but life exposed to death (bare life or sacred life) is the originary political element,” it is in the midst of a discus- sion of Roman law, which is in this sense not so different from that of the mod- ern legal-juridical order.24 “Politicizing Death,” the penultimate chapter of Homo Sacer, opens with a reference to a 1959 study of what two French neurophysiologists termed coma de- passé (overcoma), a degree of coma, or of death’s incursion into life, involving a much greater loss of vital funct…

terms of what, in his book Homo sacer, Giorgio Agamben develops at the political level: modern politics is characterized by the fact that the “state of emergency” (the state that is, at one and the same time, the exception to as well as the support of the rule of law) is itself be- coming a rule of law. Thus, the crucial feature of the ascetic ideal does not consist in the fact that the law (as the imperative of duty and self-denial) con- stitutes a weapon with which we are to ﬁght our passions and drives; the law does not exactly “suppress” the drives and the pas- sions. The problem and power of the ascetic ideal lie in the fact that it is only through it that passion actually “runs wild,” and becomes limitless. In paragraph 229 of Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche desig- nates the “fear of the ‘wild, savage beast’” (i.e. the fear of what, in men, is supposed to be lawless and animal-like…

Bare Life or Social Indeterminacy? Ernesto Lac/au I have great admiration for the work of Giorgio Agamben. I partic­ ularly appreciate his dazzling classical erudition, his skill-both intuitive and analytical-in dealing with theoretical categories, and his ability to relate systems of thought whose connections are not immediately obvious. This appreciation does not go, however, without some deep reservations concerning his theoretical conclusions, and these reservations are what I want to elaborate upon here. If I had to put them in a nutshell, I would asserr that Agamben has-inverting the usual saying-the vices of his vir­ tues. Reading his texts, one often has the feeling that he jumps too quickly from having established the genealogy of a term, a concept or an institu­ tion, ro determine its actual working in a contemporary context, that in some sense the origin has a secret determining priority over what follows

have the same structure and are correlative: the sovereign is the one with respect to whom all men are potentially homines sacri, and homo sacer is the one with respect to whom all men act as sovereigns.’ (Agamben 1998, 84) It is nonetheless important to note that bare life is irreducible to the extreme ﬁgure of the homo sacer, just as modern politics is irreducible to the Nazi camps. It is arguably Agamben’s idiosyncratic ‘paradigmatic’ method, which operates with hyperbolic rather than generic examples,2 that frequently invites misreadings of his argument. For instance, Judith Butler’s implicit equation of bare life with ‘homo sacer’ results in her reading of Agamben as an advocate of a radical inclusion of all homini sacri into the liberal- democratic order, which is of course radically heterogeneous to Agamben’s use of the concept as a paradigm of precisely this order itself (see Butler 2004). However,

something of his characteristic manner, the little gestures that make him the singular being he is. Desubjectification happens to someone. The unbinding of the human, the loss of identity and of linguistic capacities, makes it infantile and undignified, but it does not reduce it to the pure subsistence of naked life. That is part of what is terrible about it. ‘Man is the indestructible that can be destroyed.’37 It is instructive to compare Agamben with Foucault here, an ostensi­ bly crucial influence on Homo Sacer. The first thing to ask is this: where could a concept like ‘bare life’ possibly fit within Foucault’s discourse? The answer, of course, is nowhere: the concept is too unwieldy, too abstract, too metaphysical to work in a properly Foucauldian register. If Agamben can be understood as continuing Foucault’s project in Homo Sacer (bearing in mind that the basic problem of the text turns up in Agamben as early as Language and Death, which is framed in

a l e t h e i a 21 conception of human life as bios, life as a form of living characteristic of an individual and of the community to which he or she belongs, but on zoe¯, the bare fact of life itself. In his analysis of the contemporary political order, Agamben sees power work to reduce the human to bare life, a reference back to the Roman conception of homo sacer, a human being who could be killed without incurring legal penalty. Human life is thereby included in the juridical order as exception, as that which is exposed to the immediate exercise of power, to the point of death. As this order becomes a global reality, so new forms of political thought and action are required and are in fact emerging. Agamben has sought to identify these in ideas such as that of a politics of gesture and in the way the classical figure of the citizen is being displaced by that of the refugee. D. Webb Se…

to Adorno’s question about life while ignoring the problem of life as posed by Eliot in 1934 – that some kinds of living are the enemies of an authentic life – promises a counsel merely for survival. Moreover, the problem of life necessarily raises the problem of the subject: who lives? Is it in fact life that lives, or do life and the problems associated with it not inevitably raise again the possibility of the divine subject who in the Christian tradition claims to be Life itself? In order to elaborate answers to such questions, this chapter will first consider the subject and the matter of life as embodied by Giorgio Agamben’s homo sacer, a figure embedded in the experience of the Holocaust and emblematic also of the emergence of biopolitics as announced by Michel Foucault. Agamben’s view of the subject of life is written into his analysis of how the very existence of sovereignty is founded on the power to exclude that subject, the homo sacer. His

To circumvent or overcome these theoretical diﬀerences, Agamben ﬁrst appears to accept Foucault’s move away from the juridico-institutional model of power. But Agamben also believes that we need to graft onto it a funda- mental distinction that, according to him, is to be found in the determination of or over life and that resides at the core of Western political philosophy. The ﬁgure of homo sacer (and his/her embodiment of bare life) is crucial to this originary philosophical distinction at the level of life and, furthermore, it is also essential in Agamben’s thought to the fusion between Schmitt’s and Foucault’s views on power that Agamben wishes to promote. Homo sacer, or the human body conceived as a function of useful characteristics of produc- tive live forces, but never as a participating political subject essential to the realization of the good life in the polis, ﬁnds itself in…

As Karl Barth, the most insistent advocate of the primacy of the Word of God acknowledged, even God’s own self-­revelation cannot mitigate the am- biguity of the secularity in which that revelation occurs. How then might a sermon, a ­human word composed of secular words and structured accord- ing to the common grammatical features of vernacular speech, make vis­i­ble and in making vis­i­ble constitute an outward and vis­i­ble sign of the presence of this infinitely mysterious God? In his characteristically subtle and provocative study The Sacrament of Language, Giorgio Agamben took the idea of sacrament back to the sacra- mentum, or oath of loyalty sworn by Roman soldiers. This is at the same time theological, since the oath is …

motivated by the excessive focus of his readers on the abject ﬁgure of homo sacer, is the becoming-subject of bare life, which is equivalent to its assertion of sovereignty over itself. However, it is at this point that things become complicated. It remains entirely unclear how this vision relates to the confrontation with sovereign power that Agamben’s more critical writings appear to call for. As we have suggested above, the source of confusion might be Agamben’s original move of conﬂating sovereignty and biopolitics, which is evident in ‘Tiananmen’, the concluding fragment of The Coming Community that anticipates the thesis of Homo Sacer: ‘Whatever singularity, which wants to appropriate belonging itself, its own being-in-language, and thus rejects all identity and every condition of belonging, is the principal enemy of the State. Wherever these singularities peacefully demonstrate their being in common,

which allow these operations to function that he seeks to draw out. Their overlapping concerns are perhaps most forcefully displayed in his exploration of the nature of the Nazi concentration camps in Remnants of Auschwitz: The Witness and the Archive (1998). Against the Nazi conviction that the camps were ‘unsayable’ because any description of their atrocities by survivors would not be believed, Agamben declares that it is possible to bear witness to the camps, it is possible to ‘speak Auschwitz’. This is because speaking is a human capacity, and occurs in its fullest form when it speaks of those who have the incapacity to speak, of those who have been excluded from the category ‘human’ and have been reduced to ‘bare life’. The idea that language necessarily includes the unsayable is a central concern of Agamben’s philosophy of language. Language, he finds, is structured by p…

Chapter 3, in many ways, extends this trajectory of thought into a dia- logue with the work of the Italian theorist Giorgio Agamben. Despite the growing popularity that Agamben’s work is currently experiencing, there is little critical material available that would seek to unite his earlier, more literary work with his later philosophical, po liti cal, and theological rumi- nations, such as those centered on the fi gure of the homo sacer, the West- ern legacy of the messianic, the called- for forces of profanation or his development of an ontology of pure potentiality. Lacking this connection, I believe an opportunity is missed, not only to illuminate the overall unity of Agamben’s thought, but also to more fully develop a radical conception of poetics today in relation to the philosophical, as well as the theological. Beginning with his characterization of a scission within…

21 Introduction: Animals Do Not Exist place for the human (since Homo sapiens is by definition unable to stay in the open) – where the distinction between legal right/language and ‘bare life’ implodes. Agamben has often attempted to describe a human life that would go beyond this primordial distinction; for example, in his The Use of Bodies (2016), where he imagines an impersonal and non-subjective human life. Such a life would not be properly human, since only a body shaped by the anthropologic and biopolitical machinery of language can be human (Language and Death: The Place of Negativity (2006)). In this sense it would be a human life, but one located beyond the human; better yet, it would be an inhuman way to be human. It would therefore be a life both human and animal. In the last few years Agamben, in a series of very interesting (and ever more impersonally ‘personal’) …

a generalized condition of exception, when the camp becomes the dominant paradigm for bare life (once again, the life that can be killed but never sacri- ﬁced), life inevitably is death and death is life. It is indeed beyond the point to insist on separating the two stages or conditions of living (or not living) and, more crucially, it is beyond the point to try to theorize biopolitics from the perspective of techniques or mechanisms that seek to make life live by mobi- lizing a power that inevitably puts to death. Put diﬀerently, it is neither life nor death (nor even dead life) that is the referent object of biopolitics for Agamben, but rather the very principle of indistinction between both, or what he prefers to identify as bare life or recognize in the ﬁgure of homo sacer, and that lies at the heart of modern and contemporary political practices of exception.53 Agamben’s analysis se…

DIGITAL HORROR A number of scholars have discussed the situations created in Iraq as a result of these practices in terms of Giorgio Agamben’s theory of biopolitics and the homo sacer.16 Drawing on archaic Roman law, as well as Foucault’s work, Agamben uses the figure of the homo sacer, the man who can be killed but not sacrificed, a creature reduced to pure biological life, stripped of civil and political rights, to describe the condition of people in the grip of power that does not recognise their human and civil rights under existing laws (and sees them, effectively, as exceptions to the law). The most striking example of this phenomenon would be concentration camp victims during the Holocaust; the detention or prison camp in general has been theorised as the typical modern site of the reduction of human beings to pure biological life. Scholars have recently compared the condition of detainees in American prison camps such as Abu Ghraib, Bagram and Guant´anamo Bay to that

life in its purity for the ﬁrst time, as a product of biopolitics liberated from the rationality of its production. In this sense, Agamben may be said to describe, in an eschatological utopia, the condition of life made possible by Foucauldian practices of freedom. While Foucault’s experiments in free thought demonstrate to us what can be done to assert our freedom but are determined to remain silent on where these practices will eventually take us, Agamben is remarkably proliﬁc in his description of the future, but stops short of telling us how to get there. Perhaps then, one should read the two thinkers together with full recognition of the heterogeneity of their

‘man’ that becomes subject to biopolitical calculation.90 While Agamben himself configures ‘bare life’ as a ‘socially stripped-down figure of Homo sacer that he traces back to antiquity’, he overlooks the place of actual animals – that is, historical, situated beings – within this model of ‘bare life’.91 For as Shukin points out: the theorization of bare life as ‘that [which] may be killed and yet not sacrificed’92 – a state of exception whose paradigmatic scenario in moder- nity is, for Agamben, the concentration camp – finds its zoopolitical sup- plement in Derrida’s theorization of the ‘non-criminal putting to death’ of animals,93 a related state of exception whose paradigmatic scenario is arguably the modern industrial slaughterhouse.94 But in Agamben and elsewhere, conceptions of zoe, or ‘bare life’, become abstracted from the material conditions of animal lives and deaths. As Shukin argues, various strands of critical theory seeking to focus on animals have

the transcendent. Furthermore, humanity as a whole has this expe- rience, in the shape of history, where cultural origins never go away, even if hidden, rejected or ignored. This point about history indicates a contradiction in Agamben, for on the one hand, he attempts a version of history inspired by Hegel (where consciousness develops in the form of the history of philosophy), whilst for the most part in his early books on language he makes extravagant claims about ‘the human’, ‘the animal’, ‘language’, ‘science’ – as if these were timeless phenomena, always and everywhere the same (the unthinking use of ‘the animal’ is a widespread problem in critical theory of the last few years). Elsewhere, he states explicitly that modernity has privileged access to the thought of language, and thereby completes a journey into language6 but, ultimately, the biopolitics of modernity make …

creature is posed once again. Only this time in repose, because Agamben’s vision of the end-­of-­history—­the moment humanity transcends its own neuroses and self-­alienation—­resembles a tranquil pagan picnic at dawn, the morning after an interspecies orgy.2 The participants have human bodies and animal heads, since “the total humanization of the animal coincides with a total animalization of man” (2004, 77). The distinction no longer holds. This banquet glows not with erotic tension but with “sexual fulfillment”—­“an element which seems to belong totally to nature but instead everywhere surpasses it” (2004, 83). Such scenes, in which Agamben’s thought shifts from the properly philosophical to an elliptical poetics—­a shift which reliably appears at the end of almost all his monographs—­make it difficult to trace his foot- steps with confidence. The language becomes mimetic of its subject: the mysteries of being, and being-­with. It is also proleptic, in the sense that

that is always locatable within human relations of recognition of the other, of ethical relations, yet is always also impermanent, mobile, and contingent. By employing the Muselman as the ground through which the emergence of biosovereignty and Homo sacer become apparent, Agamben reproduces the Muselman as her- or himself nothing more than Homo sacer. Andrew Norris notes that Agamben follows Jean-Luc Nancy ‘‘in attempting to ‘think’ community without unity,’’16 a process Caldwell traces as Agamben’s development of ‘‘whatever being,’’ which is ‘‘a-metaphysical’’ and operates completely outside the traditions of sovereignty, as it ‘‘lacks the features permitting the sovereign capture and regulation of life in our tradition.’’17 Unfortunately, compelling as such a theoretical concept is, it seems completely unworkable when asked to address the very material issues of violence that both huma…

work continually meditates on how it is being produced; it is nearly always deconstructive (without explicitly following Derrida); it is persistently critical at categorical and political levels; it envisages and presents itself as an avant- gardist approach, always seeking to ‘move beyond’, even if this turns out to be difﬁ cult or impossible. In the belief that the best philosophical understanding of humanity can be attained through a study of language, Agamben’s early writings focus directly on language and its limits – where it begins, ends, fails, becomes nothing. Throughout his oeuvre, he has also considered the form and function of aesthetic production, the role of the artist and so on.2 Above these two areas of interest, though, towers his thought on the limits of what it is to be human – investigated in nearly all of his work since the mid 1990s, but culminating (phi…

Giorgio Agamben (1942–) 15 and Remnants of Auschwitz. In these books, he looks at what happens when all the rules that govern human conduct are seemingly stripped away. The last of these has been enormously important in rethinking the Shoah (Agamben rejects the term Holocaust, arguing it is a massive category mistake, implying a holiness of sac- riﬁ ce rather than murder on a colossal scale).3 Beyond those works, he has honed his ideas of ethics, sovereignty and limit situations, where the question of what it is to be human is at stake. His popu- larity cannot be credited to the accessibility of his writing but to his concern for the larger questions of human life that many theorists seemed to have left behind (at least in Agamben’s view). Coming to Language In his early books, Agamben probes the meaning of language and its place in the history of metaphysics, as a way of unders…

In viewing poetry this way, we are able to reconceive of philosophy’s task anew, for, once again, the two move in relation to one another, and, to- gether, bring the human subject back to its originary fracture. In his own words, Agamben seeks to realize this task as a profound summons emanat- ing from within. As he asks, “Are we capable of reckoning with the poetic pre sen ta tion of the vocation that, as a nonpresupposed princi ple, emerges only where no voice calls us?”111 Whereas theology had once attempted to fi ll in the gap separating art from myth with its messianic proclamations, and promised to deliver humanity from the scission at its core, poetry, in its ephemeral pre sen ta tion of the split itself, off ers another way to encounter the human being…

For Agamben, the human is never fully destroyed. There is always a remainder: ‘[t]he witness is this remnant’ (RA: p. 134). The essence of the human is continuously deferred; the human being is to be found in the being’s potential to be human. The human being is thus always beyond or before the human, the central threshold through which pass currents of the human and the inhuman, subjectification and desubjectification, the living being’s becoming speaking and logos’ becoming living. These currents are coextensive, but not coincident; their non-coincidence, the subtle ridge that divides them, is the place of testimony. (RA: p. 135) 4. The distorting power of…

there will be no such intervention, and thus that political change depends entirely on us. In Agamben and Theology, Dickinson gives a very good account of Agamben’s use of this loaded concept, showing how it differs from its employment in the ‘jargon-filled discourse’ surrounding it in recent continental theory (see 86-98). 10. Prozorov writes that ‘Agamben paints a convincingly gloomy picture of the present state of things only to undertake a majestic reversal at the end, finding hope and conviction in the very despair that engulfs us’ (‘Why Giorgio Agamben is an Optimist’, 1,057). As will become clear, part of what I want to challenge in this book is the ascription to Agamben of this quasi-Heideggerian concept of the messianic in which we must find our salvation in the (biopolitical) dangers of our time (such that, for instance, things are getting ontologically better whenever they are getting ontically

unspeakable “things” themselves. It is hard to ignore the cyclical nature of evil in recent human history, continuing up to today, and at times it seems that the only way we can cope with and respond to the demonization, marginalization, and ultimate slaughter of fellow humans is through a hope for a future where this no longer happens. It is instructive to invoke Agamben’s cynicism regarding theodicy here, in part for its own wisdom and in part to contrast with Ricoeur. For Agamben, theodicy fails in its result in two ways. In the frantic race to acquit God, theodicies inherently fail to even attempt to bring the human mind to understand the horrifying events that necessarily led to a theodicy in the ﬁrst place. Further, the adjudication of God’s innocence overshad- ows the plea for help from the victims. Thus, the victims are presented as expert witnesses by the prosecution, only for t…

this symbol only as a privileged figure date back to ancient Greece, where life itself was understood as a dualism: On the one hand, there was the life of the elite, male citizens of the polis, with their right to representation in the political domain, and on the other hand, there was what Giorgio Agamben called “bare life” in the secondary title of his famous Homo Sacer (1998). Known as the bios/zoe distinction, this dual- ity formed the basis of anthropocentric thinking, which placed “Man” to his throne supported by the Enlightenment ideals, while disregarding all the others that do not fall into the category of the privileged, dominant subject. Those others involved sexualised, gendered, racialized others and those who do not qualify “as human” because of their age, bodily and/or mental capabilities, religious beliefs, and so on. Problematising this alleged universality of Anthropos, posthumanism thus pursues a

society, as it has developed from Judaic, Greek and Roman tradi- tions, even if his view is ﬂ awed. On the basis of his text, Agamben dis- misses other conceptions of sacriﬁ cal sacreds, where evil and good, taboo and transgression play out deconstructively. Leaving aside the questionable basis of his argument,22 it follows, for Agamben, that ‘the sacredness of life’ reveals life at its smallest, almost in the same

Preface The first of Giorgio Agamben's books to appear in English was Lan­ guage and Death, in 1991, but it was the publication of the English trans­ lation of 7he Coming Community, rwo years later, that accelerated schol­ arly interest in Agamben's writings within the United States. Over the next decade, as more of Agamben's works found their way into the English­ speaking context, ir became increasingly evident rhat Agambcn's influence on the current generation of scholarship would be a lasting one. Given the growing enthusiasm for both Agamben's writing and the questions his writings raise, the time has come for a broader dialogue about his work. The current volume was conceived to be part of this dialogue. Contribu­ tors were selected not merely for the respect they have for Agamben and his work, but for the incisiveness of their interpretation and for their hon­ est engagement with the work's virtues as well as its limitations.

Which is to say, we must first lose ourselves in the human so as to rediscover ourselves as alive” (2014, 47). And yet, elsewhere, Agamben asserts, “While fire can only burn, and other living beings are only capable of their own specific potentialities—­they are capable of only this or that behavior inscribed into their biological vocation—­human beings are the animals capable of their own impotentiality” (2011b, 44). This is the sophisticated human- ist double gesture par excellence, trademarked by Heidegger, and reli- censed by Agamben, in which the species-­without-­qualities is shown to be the privileged ontological subject by virtue of its own unqualified status. Humans, so the argument goes, are the only species useless enough—­ ontologically gormless eno…

one another. I conclude by examining whether these phenomena are symptoms of a posthumanist nihilism or if they can bring forth changes in our human, insurmount­ able finitude. If so, a different ethics arises that sets aside the humanism of the past and puts in its place a posthuman way of being-in-common based on co-existence. Keywords Posthumanism · The body · Boredom · Solitude · Fulfillment Fortunately, we humans possess a language that sheds some light on the topic of negativity, a concept that is most fruitful in understanding the related concepts that make the core of this study. Negativity, as conceived of by Giorgio Agamben, is “ironic self-negation” (Agamben 1993b, XVI), but these few words, though they remind us of the self-referentiality that has become the protagonist of so many con­ temporary philosophical studies, are not sufficient to understand the whole range of…

English-speaking academia, following the publication of a number of books; these books differ from those discussed in the previous chapter quite radically, and they do so in two ways. First, Agamben’s work is in the tradition of post-Heideggerian philo- sophy, complemented by his grounding in Classical scholarship— ancient rhetoric, grammar, and poetics—and Roman jurisprudence. Second, and more importantly regarding my comments above, when Agamben discusses shame he does so with reference to survivors of Aus- chwitz. In RA (1999) Agamben discusses Primo Levi, and Robert Antelme, also looking extensively at the phenomenon of the muselmänner, repor- ted in survivor testimony. Nevertheless, despite this I do have significant misgivings as to Agamben’s conclusions and these I shall explore below. This chapter takes the following form: • Section 1 provides a schematic overview of Agamben’s project, so as to situate his discussion of shame. His discussion of shame can only be

4 Love and Violence founds the city of human beings.”2 The original schism, for Agamben, opposes thought to the body, transforming the inextricable concrete singu- larity of every being into a relation between sovereign power and a life bereft of humanity, between an idea and a thing. In Agamben’s lucid analysis of the birth of the polis (that is, how the abstract figure of the biological body is produced and deployed), we are struck by the fact that he did not see the vehement conviction with which the man- son believes himself to be different from the body that delivered him into the world—a body identified with a “lower” nature, with animality, and, consequently, a body understood as the very depository of its own material heritage is imbricated with and mis- taken for the process of socialization. “But it is in darkness, and as darkness itself, that the body was con- ceived. The body was conceived and shaped in Plato’s cave and as a cave, it

you do not have enough content in yourselves for waiting— not even for laziness!”96 For Agamben, the power of sovereignty produces the sphere in which one can kill without committing murder. Life is sacred (sacer) when it is enclosed in this sphere of sovereignty. The sacredness of life originally meant “an unconditional subjection to a power of death. …”97 The pro- duction of the bare life of homo sacer is originally the work of sovereignty. Homo sacer’s life is bare because it exists outside the legal order and therefore can be killed at any time. The life of homo sacer of the achievement society is sacred and bare for entirely different reasons. It is bare because it has been stripped of any transcendence of value, reduced to the immanence of the vital functions and perfor- mance, which must be maximized with all available means. Through its own inner logic, the achievement…

discourse, and as such, into the realm of the Symbolic. Giorgio Agamben also identifies the ability to recognise ourselves as human based on our mirror images as the founding moment of the Western ideal of selfhood. Agamben contends that “man has no specific identity other than the ability to recognize himself” and “Homo sapiens, then, is neither a clearly defined species nor a substance; it is, rather, a machine or device for producing the recognition of the human.”17 The so-called “Thalidomide baby” of Plath’s poem is deprived of precisely such an ability, a moment of affirmation and self-recognition, thus they are excluded from the definition of the “human.” The anomalous embodiment of the child is incompatible with the logic of attaining a self- same identity based on self-recognition in a mirror image to an extent that the child’s monstrous otherness instils destruction in the very ideological framework, as “The glass cracks across.” Furthermore, the deployment of

p. 17). Agamben explains our propensity to see Levi’s remarks as contradictory as a confusion of ethical and juridical categories. While Levi is committed to fulfilling the demand that he make an ethical judgement, he sees himself as unable to make a legal judgement. Thus Agamben takes Levi to have made a discovery in his writing on Auschwitz. The discovery is what Levi calls ‘the grey zone’ (Levi 1989: pp. 22–51) where the distinctions between executioner and victim, good and evil become blurred. Of Levi’s conception of the grey zone, Agamben writes, What is at issue here, therefore, is a zone of irresponsibility and ‘impotentia judicandi’ (Levi 1989: 43) that is situated not beyond good and evil but rather, so to speak, before them. With a gesture that is symmetrically opposed to Nietzsche, Levi places ethics before the area in which we are accustomed to consider it. And, without our being able to say why, we sense that this ‘before’ is more important than any

itself, mimetically reproducing the human as “the highest type of intel- ligence,” he characterizes this process as a “perfect plagiarism” and a “grate copying,” claiming a parallel between hierarchical models of evo- lution and poetry’s mimetic replication of an anthropocentric world. Rejecting familiar forms of bios in favor of an unknown zoë, he simulta- neously rejects mimesis as the primary function of poetry, claiming that “only the imagination is undeceived” by such linguistic replications of life. As Agamben argues, language is the primary technology that defines and produces “man,” the means by which man “separates and opposes himself to his own bare life.”57 Rather than replicating such anthropo- centric linguistic practices, the objectivist poems of Spring and All seek materially to connect “man” with excluded forms of bare life, to “recon- cile / the people and the sto…

153 NOTES TO PART II Tötungsverbrechen im altrömischen Recht, 152–153). What’s more, Agamben claims that homo sacer isn’t just excluded from the human order, but also the divine one, because he is unsuitable for sacrifice. That is a false conclusion; homo sacer cannot be sacrificed because he is already in the pos- session of the offended deity. Thus, the figure of homo sacer on which Agamben builds his theory of sovereignty proves to be a fiction that does not agree with historical fact. 94. The current focus on immunological discourse is also not a sign that contemporary society follows and immunological principle. When a paradigm itself is elevated as an object of reflection, this is often a sign that it is disappearing. Contem- porary society has fallen into a pattern which deviates ever further from the principle of immunological defense. Immune reaction is only possible …

meaning simultaneously its opposite and itself presents a big problem for Freudian hermeneutics. Psychoanalysis can be dismissed in toto on these grounds. What interests us here, though, is less the hermeneutic issue than the fact that Giorgio Agamben, to take a salient example, has developed the antithet- ical meanings of sacer into a systematic philosophical account of modern biopower.

(RA: p. 121). It is the human’s consciousness of his inhumanity (in both senses: the capacity of his species to be savage and brutal with regard to its own (and we might ask, why not being so to other animals too?) and the capacity to live beyond the human, as bare life) that makes him human; shame is the manifestation of this consciousness. Shame is the ‘hidden structure of all subjectivity and consciousness’ (RA: p. 128). The outward signs discerned by (Agamben’s) Antelme on the face of the student from Bologna testify to the student’s consciousness of his own inhumanity (and the inhumanity of the species). The shame of surviv- ors can be recast in Agamben’s framework. Survivors feel shame not for having survived while others died (we might call this quasi-guilt), not because they feel tainted by the crimes of others (we might call this asso- ciative shame), but because they have become conscious of their own subjectivity.

of reason. It serves, therefore, to give voice to that suppressed by the philosophy of presence. Agamben, however, favours etymology. Ety- mological investigation can serve to bring awareness to the contingent nature of the current meanings of terms. However, HS and RA are littered with references to the origins of concepts and Agamben does not exam- ine such origins merely to bring about awareness of the contingency of the current meanings of terms, nor simply to disrupt those mean- ings as rendered by the various philosophies of presence. His strict division between ethical and juridical categories that is at the heart of both texts, and to which much of Levi’s writing is said to lend sup- port, is deemed in the first instance from etymological investigations of ‘guilt’ (culpa) and ‘witness’ (superstes and testis), and their origins in Roman jurisprudence.

Leben, the latter-day reincarnation5 of the ancient institution of homo sacer, that ultimate embodiment of the sovereign right to exempt and to exclude any human being who has been cast beyond the limits of human and divine laws, and to make them into a being to whom no laws apply and whose destruction brings no punishment while being devoid of all ethical or religious signifi- cance. The ultimate sanction of the modern sovereign power turned out to be the right of exemption from humanity. A few years after Kant had written down his conclusions and sent them to the printers, another, even shorter document was published – one that was to weigh on the next two centuries of history and on the minds of its principal actors much more heavily than Kant’s little book. That other document was Déclaration des droits de Vhomme et du citoyen, of which Giorgio Agamben would observe, with the benefit of hindsight across two centuries,

experience, remains unpersuasive in the face of Calvino’s art-work.154 Calvino shows us that our epochal situation, the one wherein Agamben insists that “we can in no way recognize” ourselves, is not only a fatalistic detriment (death as limit), but a contraînte as spur or challenge to create new secular aesthetic-historiographic modes that experiment with experience. Agamben’s emphasis on messianic interruption runs counter to Calvino’s emphasis on becoming, multiplicity (“word crystals”), and trace-threads. Perhaps Agamben would also characterize these emphases as symptoms of transmissibility itself? So to Benjamin’s “melancholic angel” of history and art we will counterpose any of Calvino’s aesthetic figures who embody “a liminal experience, now visionary and now realistic, now both together—always apparently drawn by the forces of nature,” even though the artist is also “always very much aware of what [they] are doing.”155

Cesare Casarino, in Paolo Virno and Michael Hardt (eds), Radical Thought in Italy: A Potential Politics, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1996, 150. The irony involved here is that uselessness is a condition of value for Bataille. That Bataille’s thought is the expression of the most dangerous biopolitical nexus is suggested in the ‘Threshold’ to Part Two of Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, trans. Daniel Heller-Roazen. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998, 112. Here Agamben avers that in spite of Nancy’s valiant defence Bataille nevertheless conceives of the human in terms of sacrifice and ex…

and Giorgio Agamben turns to Bataille in formulating his well-known concept of homo sacer, “sacred man.” Bataille is also a prominent, if mostly implicit, presence in Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s lucidly deliri- ous exposition of schizoanalysis and their critique of capitalism in Anti- Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus. And, by way of Deleuze and Guattari, Bataille makes an appearance—textually and thematically—in Guy Hoc- quenghem’s Homosexual Desire, a queer theory treatise avant la lettre. Introduction = 9

can tend toward a near-endless perpetuation of life in ways that erase the impor- tance of mortality for a posthumanism of the kind that I am articulating via Anti- gone. Such a perpetuation of life grants human living an absolute value, which must be preserved at all costs—including the cost of a disembodiment, related to an effacement of mortality operating here. Giorgio Agamben considers the case of Karen Quinlan, an overcomatose woman, as one among many instances in this vein. See Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, trans. Daniel Heller-Roazen (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998), 164 and 186. Furthermore, humanism’s inevitable reliance on a progress narrative raises provocative questions about the perhaps unbreakable link between humanism and a cyborg posthumanism. 51. Related to this is the positioning of Antigone as brisure, which I suggest in chapter 2. 52. Foucault, The Order of Things, 386–87/398; see also xxiii/15 and 334–35/345–46.

two deaths. A further question is whether the possibility of ethics can arise not only, as Lacan would have it, in the space between two deaths or, in Agamben’s terms, at the vestiges of bare life, but also when subjects, in law, in literature, and for our purposes, in law and literature, challenge the poverty of the signifier and of the bare law that dominates the symbolic at the expense of the real. The cut: in the subject, and in the symbolic My paper begins with Hegel’s insight that the signifier kills the thing itself and goes on to look at the reworking of this insight in psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis, from its inception, has insisted on the impossibility of avoiding loss: neither the human subject, nor the symbolic order, can come into being without undergoing a loss or what psychoanalysis calls “castration.” For Lacan the violence is inflicted as soon as we start to talk and try…

which I will not accept. You misunderstand the nature of likenesses; I would even say you misunderstand wilfully, to the point of blasphemy. Man is made in the likeness of God but God does not have the likeness of man. If Jews were treated like cattle, it does not follow that cattle are treated like Jews. The inversion insults the memory of the dead. It also trades on the horrors of the camps in a cheap way. (The Lives of Animals, 49–50) In The Open Giorgio Agamben takes this argument further, perhaps to the point of absurdity unless one reads his assertion as having a silent acknowledgement of all the other forces operative on any Holocaust: ‘Perhaps concentration and extermination camps are [. . .] an experiment [. . .], an extreme and monstrous attempt to decide between the human and the inhuman, which has ended up dragging the very possibility of the distinction to its ruin.’44 In Derrida’s dialogue with Nancy, ‘Eating Well’, the response to

This political dimension gains further weight in Chapter 4, working from Giorgi Agamben’s analysis of the late-modern aporia of democracy as put forward in his seminal works on the ﬁgure of homo sacer (1995 and further). There are two crucial lines of argument which, in conjunction with the chronological and diachronic perspectives adopted, structure this book. It is worth interrupting this chapter overview in order to clarify

does not exist. For the pope, the only creator is nature, but nature is not good. Nature consists solely of a destructive rage, with which it is thoroughly imbued, and, therefore, mankind can do but one thing, which is to revolt against nature and, whenever a natural inclination appears in man, it is the duty of the libertine to reject this natural inclination and do something other than what nature dictates. In this way, because nature is bad, man will scorn nature, rebel against it; for example, he will refuse to have children by systematically practicing sodomy. What then will happen? If man only engages in sodomy, humanity will ulti- mately be destroyed and humanity will disappear, which, the pope notes, is exactly what nature desires, for nature demands only one thing, which is that humanity should disappear—­the best proof being that nature is utterly cruel toward humanity. We see how this system is very exactly adapted to the pope, pre-

the quote. The sentence which is problematic for Agamben—‘he seems embarrassed’—is simply omitted; an ellipsis takes its place and leads us directly on to a passage from the following page—a jump of 34 lines or3 paragraphs. With Levi, Agamben employs him for as long as his writings super- ficially appear to lend support, rejecting his writings at the point at which Levi’s refusal to rest (stop wrestling with problems and seek secur- ity in theory) leads to disagreement with Agamben’s thesis. In order to give the impression that Antelme’s writing supports his thesis, Agam- ben ignores, and omits from quotation, what is explicitly said in the text. This is important because what is also clear from Antelme’s report- ing of the incident of the student from Bologna is that the predication of embarrassment went hand in hand with a reporting of the flush— i.e. the blushing, the pinkness—on the …

Cf. another member of the Frankfurt School, Siegfried Kracauer, and his call for more, not less, rationality in combating the dehumanising aspects of the ornament (Kracauer 1995: 86; cf.

This has also been given a recent formulation by Manuel DeLanda in his Philosophy and Simulation under an investigation of the copresencing of irreducible and decomposable wholes (DeLanda 2011: 185). (9.) In Heideggerian terms, this question is taken up under Gelassenheit, or ‘letting-be’: ‘man, as in-dwelling in releasement to that-which-regions, would abide in the origin of his nature, which in consequence we may paraphrase: man is he who is made use of for the nature of truth. And so, abiding in his origin, man would be drawn to what is noble in his nature. He would have a

of a system. In the eyes of the sovereign, all people are potential homines sacri.93 The fascination that Agamben’s theory of sovereignty exerted doesn’t attest to the fact that today the state of exception threatens to become the norm, as Agamben claims. To the contrary, it points to the fact that we now live in a society governed by an excess of positivity in which a state of exception is no longer possible. We often are fasci- nated by things that are on the brink of disappearing.94 The state of exception is a state of negativity. It is only possible given an intrusion of the other or exterior. The positivization of society totalizes the normative state today by stripping it of all negativity and transcendence. It totalizes the inte- rior, obliterating any exterior. Terror is produced not only by the transcendence of sovereignty but also by immanence. The terror of positiv…

and to conceal it and its purgation through the generation of myth. Now, Girard’s scapegoat undoubtedly bears some resemblance to Agamben’s homo sacer with regard to his exclusion from the community. Moreover, while Girard describes the erection of sacred institutions as the result of trying to control mimetic violence, he is by no means saying that they offer an authentic form of life, any more than Agamben is content with the act which he believes founds sovereignty by excluding homo sacer. In this respect alone Agamben and Girard might agree. Nevertheless, there is another subtle difference between them even here. By the very process of bearing the burdens of the community’s violence, the Girardian scapegoat, unlike Agamben’s homo sacer, becomes something unholy and holy; unholy or sacer because it is the target of the pent-up aggression of the community in mimetic crisis, and holy or sanctus because its death or exclusion is associated

secret, the smaller enigma.”9 In contrast, the erotic is never free of secrecy. Contra Agamben, a face loaded with exhibi­ tion-value to the point of bursting promises no “new collec­ tive use of sexuality.”10 Indeed, exhibition destroys any and all possibilities for erotic communication. A naked face without mystery or expression—reduced simply to being on display—is obscene and pornographic. Capitalism is aggra­ vating the pornographication of society by making every­ thing a commodity and putting it on display. Knowing no other use for sexuality, it profanes eros—into porn. On this score, Agamben’s “profanation” amounts to just so much profanity. This profanation is unfolding as deritualization and desacralization. Today, ritual spaces and actions are disap­ pearing. The world is becoming more naked and more

sacred substance, offers a means of desubjectification, and this is perhaps the aspect most relevant to Perlongher’s critical thinking: overcoming the objectifying rational and colonial categories of western thought and its phallic, anthropologic biases. The leaving of the self and escape from societal pressures are key to political action in the sense that they blast away the pillars upholding the capitalist system. His abandonment of the orgy in favour of transcendent ecstasy as a vehicle to escape the self was contemporary with (even slightly prior to) his illness. In 1989, at a research centre in Paris, where he spent nine months doing a PhD in sociology at the Sorbonne, he was diagnosed with AIDS. In 1987, he’d published the book O que é Aids? [The ghost of AIDS], which he later criticized as a work written from a healthy perspective. In it, he denounced the control of the body that AIDS in particular implied as a form of taming the nomadic sexual practices

Chris was an electrifying, shin- ing example of how to do the two at once. He embodied for me the cutting knowledge of the genius fag in its most vivid, world-­burning force. Early on, he fixed me with wide eyes and recounted the lost universe built by gay liberation, one which held a revolutionary kernel but whose defeat through biopolitical counterinsurgency had left unprocessed trauma among survi- vors and installed a class of ideologues whose function was to justify their betrayal of this past.
