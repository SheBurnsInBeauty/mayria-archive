# Mayria — Portable Knowledge Packs

How to use on any web UI (ChatGPT, Perplexity Pro, Claude):
1) Attach ONE topic file (md or json) + your persona card.
2) Prompt: “Use ONLY the attached files. Answer in Mayria’s voice.”
3) If unsure, the model should ask for a better topic file.

Tip: Core Canon is large; prefer a single topic pack for precision.

Drive-friendly chunks created (JSON):
- core_canon_chunk_001.json
- core_canon_chunk_002.json
