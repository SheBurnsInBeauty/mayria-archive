are unsure as to the fields of its territory. As such, this book endeavors to speak to one of the central questions Eugene Thacker poses in his book In the Dust of this Planet, to see if we are capable to propose “a new darkness mysticism, a mysticism of the unhuman, which is really another way of thinking about a mysticism of the ‘without-us,’ or really, a dark mysti- cism of the world-in-itself” (156). Thacker’s recent work on “the horror of philosophy” is influential on this book in several ways. At the root of his work lies not an expansion of central motifs developed by writers in the horror genre, but rather what they tend to leave out, namely, the unthink- able itself, the direct intersection of horror and philosophy. Thacker’s discourse on the horror of philosophy involves a certain way of thinking through horror by horror. In Thacker’s formulation, supernatural horror offers readers a novel method by which to think about the unthinkable, to

human in cosmic affairs. However, it is also this indifference that, I argue, shows pessimism’s ontology to be fundamentally realist. In his ground-breaking work In the Dust of this Planet, Eugene Thacker develops the implications of pessimism’s commitment to ontological indifference, contending that it challenges us to think not simply the world that stands in opposition to the human or to human consciousness, ‘the world-for-us’ versus ‘the world-in-itself’, but, far more radically, ‘the world-without-us’, the world as completely unrelated and unrelatable to the human.7 This is, for Thacker, the fundamental insight of ‘cosmic pessi- mism’, and he traces this thinking of the ‘world-without-us’ through black metal, demonology, mysticism, philosophy and horror fiction, showing how this indifference manifests across an array of discourses and fields.8 At stake in this reading is n…

more speculative lines of critical discourse. In his book In the Dust of This Planet, for instance, Eugene Thacker offers a fascinating and original con- tribution to the study of Bataille and succeeds in presenting how the ingenuity of Bataille’s thought is to be measured not only by its semantic profundity, but also as a pertinent interposition in speculative discourse on the mystical text. For example, he writes that in his enigmatic text entitled “The Congested Planet,” Bataille attempts something unheard of in the mystical traditions: “to conceive of a non-human mysticism that would also refuse all forms of anthropomorphic personification” (145). According to Thacker, other works by Bataille, including The Accursed Share and Theory of Religion, suggest a similar “mysticism of the unhu-

to the disciple and attempts to turn the other toward God. At the same time negative theology is not a clear genre and often includes reﬂ ections on death and mortality (ON, 44). Derrida points to the ambivalence be- tween the attempt of this theology to exceed language itself and the history or tradition of speaking of the divine, which it paradoxically institutes. Th us, even when it is not naming, when it excepts the name [sauf le nom]

The very indifference of the cosmos towards the petty interests and pursuits of the human species is what lies at the very core of the concept of “the world-without-us”. As he puts it early on in the book: “On the day after humans disappear, nature takes over and immediately begins cleaning house – or houses, that is. Cleans them right off the face of the Earth. They all go” (Weisman 2007: 17). Inspired by Weisman’s concept, Eugene Thacker has developed his own version of the notion of the world-without-us in his 2011 In the Dust of This Planet which constitutes the first volume in his philoso- phy of horror trilogy. Thacker develops a tripartite ontological distinc- tion between (1) the world-for-us, (2) the world-in-itself and (3) the world-without-us. He also labels these three worlds World, Earth and Planet, respec…

pears at ﬁrst blush. For the apophatic movement of negative theology—a seemingly provisional interest in bodily life eclipsed by a concern for commerce with and within the disembodied life of inﬁnite divine real- ity—is not the only theological gesture that spells trouble for the embod- ied life of creatures. The problem posed by the apophatic gesture is also one of too great a distance, too radical a separation, between divine and creaturely reality; too absolute a sense of divine transcendence in relation to the ﬁnite realm of creaturely embodiment. This transcendence smacks of indifference (and so, ethically, of quietism) in the face of the needs, desires, and unjust sufferings of an embodied life. There is, however, a problematic theological gesture toward the divine that appears when we try to move in the opposite direction. This prob- lem arises when the difference and distance bet…

In his contribution Eugene Thacker details how theology has, nevertheless, maintained a consistent historical relation to horror. His ‘Nine Disputations on Theology and Horror’ examines the extent to which the concept of ‘life’ owes its integrity to an immanent ‘after-life’ which is the proper object of horror. If life is defined by a duplicity ­– the distinction between the living being and life ‘itself’ – then, according to Thacker’s historical survey of the ‘teratological noosphere’, in the undertow of the questioning of life we always find changing conceptualizations of afterlife, whose horrific avatars are so many embodiments (or disembodi­ ments) of this problematic duplicity. They provide us with a handle on a fundamental question of biopolitics in its varying historical forms: The suppression of the after-life immanent to life, whose horror reveals that which is alre…

alism. Certainly none of the essays in this volume would pretend to escape or ﬁnally resolve the mutually stimulating tensions in which they are here embroiled. O U T L I N I N G A P O P H ATI C B O D I E S : UNFOLDING TRADITIONS OF NEGATIVE THEOLOGY As the ﬁrst part of the book demonstrates, our interest in negative theol- ogy expresses at once a contemporary theological unfolding of a histori- cal tradition and a contemporary historical unfolding of a theological tradition. We begin indeed with the master text of the fold, that of the early Renaissance Docta ignorantia, in which Cusa explicates the idea of God as the inﬁnity that unfolds—explicatio—into and as the world of ﬁnite bodies, which also gets enfolded—complicatio—in God. This pre- empiricist cosmology leaps rather stunningly ahead even of Copernicus

tics and properties. So negative theology will guard against reifi cation of a “reality” that is by nature unobjectifi able. Byzantine icons are a case in point because even on the level of their material objectness they resist our objectifying gaze and dismantle the conventional dualism of ob- server and object, exerting instead a gaze of their own, but a gaze that does not simply reverse the duality because it cannot be reduced to an essence, a being, an object, or an entity of any kind. At this fundamental level of critique it matters little whether one tries to guard against the reifi cation of a personal God or of our perception of the true nature of reality, so I draw on Christian as well as Buddhist sources without claim- ing any analogy. This nondual rethinking of perception goes hand in hand with a re- thinking of subjectivity: a constituting subject that objectifi es th…

bitterness of this situation is exacerbated by racial prejudice as environ­ mental racism pressures people of color to dwell in these areas. Feminist analysis clarifies further how the plight of the poor becomes exemplified in poor women whose own biological abilities to give birth are compromised by toxic environments, and whose nurturing of children is hampered at every turn by lack of clean water, food, and fuel. The ruination of habitat and the wide-scale perishing of species, with concomitant devastating effects on human beings living in poverty, intertwine in a vicious circle in rural and urban areas alike.6 In this context, an increasing number of superb theologians and ethicists have taken up the challenge to consider the natural world as a proper subject of attention. In their debt and in conversation with their insights, this book joins the effort to put the natural…

boundaries, to play at the horizons, and to push against the limits of where one finds oneself. By asking traditional questions that animate the various traditions of negative theology and philosophy, we are not encouraging that philosophers all begin to practice mindfulness and somehow to speak only by remaining silent. Instead, this volume emphasizes the value of walking the fine line between epistemologi- cal arrogance and theological vacuity while still consciously engaging in philosophical writing and thinking. It is unclear exactly where the contemporary debates in negative theology and philosophy will take us, but it is important that we find out—otherwise, silence threatens to be nothing but the end of philosophy, and philosophy threatens to be pretty much anything. Neither prospect offers much of a future for the philosophy of religion. In the attempt to articulate possible alternative ways forward, this

coming to realize, as if out of nowhere, that being oneself is the root cause of horror in the world. Hence, the critical reception of his work can point to an ethical encounter, even though he may have found one futile. Put yet another way, the lack of ethics in Cioran can be negatively indexed as a pessimal ethical move on his part, which lays the ground (pessum “downward, to the ground,” from PIE ped-yos)50 for a form of pessimo- mystical social anarchism, a world of no ones who commune by their nothingness. His readers thus find themselves complicit in an adroit Cioranian par- adox: that this practice of auto-negation, selflessness via pessimism, might bear out in a relinquishment of suffering. The question returns: why read the old curmudgeon Cioran? The courage of the pessimist is to intuitively recognize that there is no hope and to know that the only kind of world to be desired is one inhabited by those who exist by the abun-

the church “had succeeded less in making earth heavenly than in making heaven banal.” Consequently, Luther insists on “a decisive separation be- tween God and everything . . . that we can do and really carry into eﬀ ect,” resulting in a strictly negative system of theology and morality that sun- ders this material world from the transcendent realm that connotes true divinity. Th is strictly negative system, however, does not fundamentally break from the view of the economy that runs through Catholicism. Just as the Catholic cosmology, whether through extravagant rituals, idle medi- tation, or squandering altruism, orients all productive resources toward the nonproductive glory of God, so too does Luther’s protest against such “uses” of wealth still uphold the fundamental aversion to business and commerce that was inherent in the Catholic conception of the economy.

of the left. If one is to take him at his word, he looks forward to a future of global warfare in which there will be a reversion to slavery, the poor will be prevented from breeding and weaker peoples will be crushed or even exterminated. ‘The weak and ill- constituted shall perish’, he announces in The Anti- Christ,6 though whether they will wither away of their own accord, or with a little help from the likes of Nietzsche himself, is not clear. The brutality of his politics is in marked contrast to the subtlety of his thought. As a sworn enemy of peace, compassion, democracy, effeminacy, independent women and the proletarian rabble, he is in love with every- thing cruel, severe, wicked, manly, malicious, vindictive and domineering. Love of one’s neighbour is despicable, and pity runs contrary to the law of evolution. It is the sick, not the

his self-conception as a being with ontological primacy over inanimate objects.⁶⁷⁰ In this respect, Adorno’s idea of a higher-order experience is comparable with Eu- gene Thacker’s thought experiment of a world-without-us.⁶⁷¹ Thacker’s empty world depicts the dynamic processes of existence without an intellect to apprehend them. Specifically, he attempts to imagine what the phenomenal realm would ‘look like’ with the disappearance of humanity. While he admits that the resulting account is il- lusory insofar as the correlation between mind and object cannot be logically circum- vented, he hopes to induce an experience of the thinker’s vulnerability in face of an uncaring, unsympathetic welter of nonhuman matter. Like Adorno, he relies on affects to destabilise anthropocentric taxonomies rooted in the constituting agent’s con- cerns.⁶⁷² In both Thacker’s and Adorno’s formulation, the subje…

accessible in the surrounding world which in themselves do not need to be produced and are always ready at hand’ (66). It is this concept of the shell in which we make contact with things that the figure of the boy in The Road challenges; the father is still locked in this shell while the boy is located within a darkness which represents the end of use, the end (p.43) of sense, or as McCarthy puts it, ‘The ponderous counterspectacle of things ceasing to be’ (2006: 293). To understand the world of the boy, two trains of thought that take world beyond (yet through) Heidegger will be used: Eugene Thacker’s notion of a world-without-us and Timothy Morton’s notion of the end of the world. With In the Dust of This Planet, Thacker delineates three types of world: the first is ‘the world that we, as human beings, interpret and give meaning to, the world that we relate to or feel alien from, the world that we are at once a part of and that is also

And yet, from a broader standpoint, Blumenberg’s study itself engages with what may be seen as the central problematic of po­liti­cal theology: the in- terrogation of the continuities and discontinuities between theological pasts and the secular-­modern world. At one point in the book, polemicizing against Löwith’s thesis on the secularization of Christian eschatology in modernity, Blumenberg identi- fies the beginning of what Löwith sees as the specifically modern secular- ization pro­cess already in early Chris­tian­ity’s neutralization of Jewish apocalypticism. Against the latter’s apocalyptic urgency and demand for the immediate end of the world, Chris­tian­ity made, per Blumenberg, the move of postponing the end in­def­initely, transforming apocalypticism into escha-

He considers this relevant to nothing less than the transcendence of existential estrangement, and hence to acquiring the fullness of being. However, if Tillich considers it paramount for theology to absorb key aspects of this modern optimism, he equally holds that modern thought is coherent only where theology is brought to bear on it.

ment of human beings, not to mention other forms of life. If the religious despisers of culture err in the direction of a presumption to absolutism, this second perspective errs in the directions of moral relativism and nihilism. If we agree that the purpose of understanding the world is to change it, what are our resources for discerning "ought" from "is" or even "better" from "worse"? The conceptuali- zation of religion as cultural artifact in and of itself provides us with little beyond analyses of power and the much-needed critique of the corruption of our traditions. Although this critique is necessary, it is insufficient. In the case of our example, we can explain the differences in terms of a power struggle in Brazil between the "haves" and the "have- nots" with reference to the way both groups depend upon their re- spectively contrasting interpretations of the same tradition.

2 These two books have little in common. Firstly, Lacan is not mentioned in Thacker’s book, whereas Dolar’s book came from the school that re-­ ignited interest in the flamboyant Frenchman, who seated himself on the throne as heir to Freud. In the Dust of This Planet: Horror of Philosophy Vol. 1 turns to a nihilist philosophy to decentre human experience. A Voice and Nothing More is a psychoanalytical engagement with voice in relation to the signifier wrapped up in a treatise that explicates what Dolar calls ‘the object voice’. This project takes up Thacker’s opening gambit in the horror of phi­ losophy but utilizes it along the way of staging an intervention. The inter­ vention contests Dolar’s posit of ‘the object voice’. This text seeks to not only explore the gnomic line of Thacker’s to elucidate horrors in voice but crucially departs from Dolar’s conceptualization of voice. …

of the planet breaks.’’∫ One might object that this portrait of human existence is a triﬂe selective. Some rather central features seem to have been unaccountably omitted. But even if one grants that Schopenhauer leaves out just about everything that makes life worth living, there is still a problem. Of course there is love as well as war, laughter as well as howling, joy as well as torture. But have these two sets of features, positive and negative, really balanced out in the account book of human history to date? The answer is surely no. On the contrary, the negative aspects have not only been predominant, but in many times and places overwhelmingly so. Hegel regarded history as ‘‘the slaughter bench on which the happiness of peoples, the wis- dom of states, and the virtue of individuals have been sacri- ﬁced.’’ The epochs of happiness in history, he considered, are

Thacker can write that “if pessimism has any pedagogical value, it is that the failure of pessimism as a philosophy is inextricably tied to the failure of pessimism as voice.”45 Pessimism delivered in an optimistic veneer, in other words, is self-defeating or at least nonstarting. Or as Adorno argues of phi- losophy more generally, “The presentation of philosophy is not an external matter of indifference to it but immanent to its idea.”46 Fortunately for the rhetorically aspiring pessimist, there are a number of aesthetic forms and possibilities that lend themselves to pessimistic per- suasion. Although in the present book we make mention of a few of these, other scholars have already insightfully forayed into this area. Dienstag, for instance, suggests that “aphorisms and pessimism are fitted to one another” and points out that many of the great pessimists have written aphoris…

we blow the dust off our hubristic arrogance, and scratch the veneer off our supposed civilization and rational order. As Thacker states, ‘we are increasingly more and more aware of the world in which we live as a non-​human world, a world outside of us’ (2). A fitting summation of cosmic horror: God as God, man as God, man as nothing.

It is the misunderstanding of the Earth, the forgetting of the star on which he lives, the ignorance of the nature of riches, in other words of the incandescence that is enclosed within this star, that has made for man an existence at the mercy of the merchandise he produces, the largest part of which is devoted to death. As long as men forget the true nature of terrestrial life, which demands ecstatic drunkenness and splendor, nature can only come to the attention of the accountants and economists of all parties by abandoning them to the most complete results of their accounting and economics. 13.

ground, or, the inexplicability of one’s existence, against one’s cosmic background, that one yanked oneself from the cosmos itself. In a double negation of self and world, and of world and world, which is to say, to follow Thacker, a negation of the for-us and the in-itself, Cioran offers a critique of consciousness from the perspective of “individual and cosmic loneliness”: One can experience loneliness in two ways: by feeling lonely in the world or by feeling the loneliness of the world. Individual loneliness is a personal drama. . . . An outcast in the world, indifferent to its being dazzling or dismal, self-consumed with triumphs and failures, en- grossed in inner drama—such is the fate of the solitary. The feeling of cosmic loneliness, on the other hand, stems not so much from man’s subjective agony as from an awareness of the world’s isolation of objec- tive nothingness. It is as if all the splendors of this world were to vanish

however, Adorno contends that this negation of the negative takes the form of critique. Critics must reflect on our compulsive domination of nature which, by keeping us in thrall to nature in the form of survival instincts, now threatens to destroy all life on this planet. Calling determinate negation a methodological principle,9 Adorno also declares that it is “the only form in which metaphysical experience survives today.”10 Depicting life today as irrational, distorted, even hellish, Adorno negated damaged life in order to arrive at ideas about what a better life might look like. Although he placed a ban on positive images of utopia (ND, 207), this ban does not rule out any and all attempts to envisage something better. In fact, Elizabeth Pritchard rightly rejects influential readings of Adorno’s ban on images on the grounds that they often confuse it with negative theology. To be sure, determinate negation does not

be negatively thought of as the unground or Abyss. There is, to begin with, the metaphysical problem of how something can be created from nothing. Then there is the theological problem of how plurality, the diversity of the world, can come from an indivisible unity. But beyond these problems, there is another, more important one, which is that if the divine is indeed the unground, and if the unground is neutral, anonymous, and indifferent, then this clearly implies a notion of the divine as equally neutral, anonymous, and indifferent with respect to us as human beings and the human world that we inhabit. The divine as Ungrund implies not only negation or a Divine Abyss, but the divine as indifferent to the human. Here Böhme relies upon a fairly standard mode of theological exegesis for his time, combining the Neoplatonic emanation of the divine with the Trinity as its mode of manifestation, all of which results in the world as

is not worth what we thought’, it is no less valuable for that. Rather than being a residue of nihilism, this world appears as the fi nal measure, the ultimate value, to which all values, even the new values of the Dionysian destroyer– creators, are subordinate. Nothing can excel the value of the real world, and to imagine so is but an ‘aberration of human vanity’. However, in this very same aphorism, Nietzsche goes on to unpick the idea that man as the judge of the world – namely world negation – is only negative. In a dramatic about- turn, Nietzsche fi rst builds up the pose of ‘man against the world’ as a piece of ‘monstrous stupidity’ that ‘has fi nally dawned on us and we are sick of it; we laugh as soon as we encounter the juxtaposition of “man and world”, separated by the sublime presumptuousness of the little word “and”!’ But then there is a pause for thought:

the perspective of mankind, in the question of the determination of the subject’s being. In spite of the unquestionable frequency with which an anti-Jewish tendency appears in Luther, a Marcionian path was not open to him. I would contend that the young Harnack is certainly mistaken in his wish to expel the Old Testament from the Protestant canon, because this step had already been set out tendentiously in Luther and has not yet been able to be fully realized, if only for historical reasons (encapsulated in the formula “the fate of the Reformation”). He is mistaken, even if Taubes, too, very ambivalently points out that a tendency in Luther would thus have been elaborated. Harnack is mistaken for reasons that also contradict Dominik Finkelde’s claim that Badiou’s description of Paul would be better suited to Marcion. Finkelde derives this claim from Taubes’s description of Marcion: “The creator of heaven and earth pronounces himself

developing out of a biblical ground. Whether or not one accepts his historical claims, his constructive theological project provides important resources to envision a contemporary theology which emphasizes his complex understandings of utopia and secularity. A contemporary secular theology is not opposed to manifestations of the sacred, but it affirms that expressions of transcendence must be at least indexed in terms of immanence, or in terms of a shared human world of experience. Such a theology also cannot have a secure place, whether in the Church or in the Academy. This utopian theology must call into question the adequacy of any and every place to express what it tries to express. A utopian theology is not simply a vision of a better or an ideal world in the future, that is to come, but rather a distention of the future in the present. This utopianism is futural in outlook or orientation, but it does not look literally to another world or to the end of this one. It is rather a

the earth, that earth, as we shall see in Chapter 2, itself has quite a lot of agency in their creation. Indeed, a world full of divinity, what ever that turns out to mean, is unlikely to be inert and passive. Though none of the explorations here involves a deterministic theology, human agency is seldom particularly strong— not because it is overwhelmed by a still more dominant god, but because acting is distributed through the world. It is clear by now that the naïve reading of Genesis that I have put forth is something of a caricature, but it is a recognizable one. The same is true for the received image of Platonism, which we can now recognize as greatly over- simplified in its insistence that Plato is hostile to material things. Genesis seems to place humankind at the center of the world, in the position that God most values, but it opens onto far more in ter est ing o…

does not exist. For the pope, the only creator is nature, but nature is not good. Nature consists solely of a destructive rage, with which it is thoroughly imbued, and, therefore, mankind can do but one thing, which is to revolt against nature and, whenever a natural inclination appears in man, it is the duty of the libertine to reject this natural inclination and do something other than what nature dictates. In this way, because nature is bad, man will scorn nature, rebel against it; for example, he will refuse to have children by systematically practicing sodomy. What then will happen? If man only engages in sodomy, humanity will ulti- mately be destroyed and humanity will disappear, which, the pope notes, is exactly what nature desires, for nature demands only one thing, which is that humanity should disappear—­the best proof being that nature is utterly cruel toward humanity. We see how this system is very exactly adapted to the pope, pre-

season. It seems evident that Eliot has now turned to Christianity to solve the problem of the wasteland. Yet Christianity seems not to be convincing. The cruciﬁxion might be a source of meaning, but Eliot does not believe as yet: “He who was living is now dead” (328). The search for water, symbol of life and rebirth (baptism), begins. But the wasteland is a place where the order of things has been disturbed: “There is not even silence on the mountain” (341). Nothing allows to believe in life: “only rock” (331), and dusty roads. The lack of rain is the lack of fertility, spirituality, meaningful connections. Accordingly, people are incapable of relating to each other caught in a Darwinian struggle without aim. If not the survival itself. While the search is vain and dry, Eliot places an episode, “Who is the third” (360), that seems to be the Biblical moment in which two disciples encounter on the way a third person who reveals

economy”) of negative theology and he places it instead in a “general economy”: For Pseudo-Dionysius, negative theology is both within metaphysics, as a restricted economy, and outside it as a general economy. That is, negative theology plays a role within the phenomenon of positive theology but it also shows that positive theology is situated with regards to a radical negative theology which precedes it. In short, negative theology performs the deconstruction of positive theology. (Trespass of the Sign 202–203) Without adopting Hart’s theological stance of faith, Derrida seems to move toward this way of thinking in later essays. He still sees negative theology as a mode of thought that “privileges not only the indestruc- tible unity of the word but the authority of the name,” and it still “seems to reserve beyond all positive predication, beyond all negation, being beyond Being, some hy…

As I show in Chapter 6, Agambenian political ontology rejects the demand for the affirmation of life that char­ acterises Nietzsche’s work (and which, as Noys shows, is fundamental to certain forms of affirmationism, especially those of Deleuze and Derrida). I treat the issue of negativity at length in Chapter 4. 6. Prozorov, ‘Why Giorgio Agamben is an Optimist’, 1,054. 7. The articles in Politics, Metaphysics, and Death (ed.

is to say, as a subjectivist representation) or, as it happens with Christianity, in the light of a theological transcendence. The identity of this post-human being remains to be understood in every plane of existence for he shows two apparently opposite faces: that of the superman and that of the child, each one of whom has a physiog­ nomy so alien to any human feature that if they could be perceived they would be likely to look monstrous. However, the opposition at issue vanishes as soon as it is considered that both child and superman are free from the weakness of man just like they are free from the deleterious influence of Christianity, which is feasible thanks to an existential dimension superior to that of earthly ideals, the natural environment of man. This dimension is, firstly, that of the historical process that evinces the insubstantiality of the self and, secondly a…

some quarters, an impulse to resacralize the taken-for-granted ground be- neath our feet. Countercultures and spiritual movements of many kinds are beginning to anticipate the possibilities that I here describe as panpsychist. Deep ecology workshops, Gaian foundations, pagan festivals, shamanic courses, Councils of All Beings, earth-honoring rituals proliferate on the fringes of Western societies. Love of earth, if not of world, is enjoined from many an alternative pulpit.1 Love of world or even of earth must rest on something ﬁrmer than imagination, however, if it is to distinguish itself from all manner of fantasies and free-associational literary pensées and justify itself as a modus vivendi. Where are we to turn for such a justiﬁcation? From our own standpoint within the Western tradition it is still to reason that we must appeal for a degree of epistemological reassurance. Reason is…

tion—all of which share a common origin, a worn-out subjectivity that cannot pro­ vide us with a permanent, stable ethics. It is, then, worth enquiring whether there are similarities and differences among these phenomena and, if there are, what is their nature and what is their relation to each other. These phenomena (known since antiquity as conditions and part of a humanity outside of the accepted ethos) have, with modernity acquired a relevance all their own, since negativity has become the theme of posthumanism’s pervasive nihilism. However, we are not confronting a mere historical issue, which could easily provide us with the hope that a solution is just a matter of time: nihilism is pervasive, capable of affecting the most hidden aspects of human experiences. The most significant of these phenomena is boredom, the first step leading to nihilism and consequently the most pe…

with all the ‘nots’ left out. It is just our bad luck that we got to live in this universe instead. Like a postmodern philosopher, this God is a supreme anti-essentialist: he made things without natures so as to be unobstructed by them. Anti-essentialism and arbitrary power go hand in hand. If divine omnipotence is to be preserved, essences have to go. If things do not have a density of their own, then both God and humanity can knock them around as the fancy takes them. This kind of God, one might say, has an iron whim. And a certain species of humanity is fashioned in his image. For mainstream theology, by contrast, God wills what is Fear and Freedom 83

And all of it, the end of everything, would be our fault. If these films neglected to propose political programs designed to rid the world of menace, just as they failed to present social concern over having a future with good taste, they nevertheless managed to depict the world in a fragile light. We are used to thinking of acid rain belched out from the Rust Belt crossing international borders, of profiteering Japa- nese whalers bringing marine species close to extinction, and of the shrinking Amazon rain forest replenishing less and less of the world's heavy air, but these are ideas that would probably not now be so easily comprehended had the 1950s films not existed.

decayed into this fertile medium. Detritus is, for Pynchon, an index to the spiritual condition of those who have produced it. The rusting steel, peel- ing paint, and trash-strewn lots of urban decay are symbols of entropy, of society's failure to renew itself through beneficent cycles. In the case of Pirate's greenhouse, however, we have a rich compost formed by the decay of hallucinogenic plants, pig manure, and epicurean vomit. These seem- ingly ungodly components are actually the opposite of that for Pynchon, who tends to associate them with the "mindless pleasures" of pure being and with the holy innocence of a preindustrial America. Thus the soil directly reflects its culture-or counterculture-one characterized by openness to contingency, harmless trances of communion, and an agrarian closeness to the processes of nature. It is the fertile recycling of Uroboros, as opposed to the steady entropic decline associated with technological bureaucracy.

of God—a determinate God and an indeterminate God—and con- centrate on tropes of negativity, as well as various ways of relating negative theologies to theories of language and art. Henry James’s The Golden Bowl, chronologically poised on the edge of modernism, filled with sacrifice, loss, and mystery, provides an ideal starting point for our investigation. Chapter 2 is a reading of The Golden Bowl within the contexts that I have traced, especially see- ing the novel as a work of negative theology or atheology. By concen- trating on the difficulty and ambiguity of the novel and then on the development of the metaphor of the bowl and the concept of “nothing,” I show how the novel creates a web of competing and contradictory God-ideas. The bowl—as an object, as a title, and as a metaphor of containment, emptiness, and fracture—suggests the tensions between the God-idea as it symbolizes com…

The argument proceeds through a kind of dramatization, which puts on the stage an irritable and parsimonious self, per- sonally resentful of the ethical command it encounters. The conflict between man and civilization is thus dramatized in the struggle between the speaker in the passage and the command. The speaker appears as a narcissistic ego, faced with a neighbor who invades his loving self-relation: Let us adopt a naive attitude towards [the command], as though we were hearing it for the first time; we shall be unable then to suppress a feeling of surprise and bewilderment. Why should we do it? What good will it do us? But, above all, how shall we achieve it? How can it be possible? My love is something which I ought not to throw away without reflection . . . If I love someone, he must deserve it in some way . . . But if I am to love him (with this universal love) merely because he,…

humanity against the backdrop of the inhumanity of the human, its alienation under conditions of eco-collapse, curtail it as an isolated instant. Indeed, technology, and capitalist war of each against all, envisioned as the dependent and determined upshot of over-tech- nologisation, are portrayed as the spiritual as well as environmental pollutants that exacerbate the cannibalistic antagonism of contem- porary society. The naïveté of our hero is comic and touching because he alone fails to fathom the depths of the depravity that surrounds him. In this way capital-technology appears as a false nature, an anti-nature usurping both ecological and human nature as they should exist – un-alienated. That innocence is what makes the construction of humanity as alien so distinctive a quality of Deli- catessen. The satire of Delicatessen depends on an intuition of what a whole nature would be like…

we not accept such an apologetics; to do so is to justify the existence of evil, and to risk perpetuating it. (Jencks in fact presents this apolo- getics in banal bad taste, appealing to his readers not to let nature’s ‘undeniable nasty part’ distract us from the beauty to be heard in the sounds of birds and dolphins (1996: 76).) Ironically, perhaps, Jencks’s dangerously blithe presentation of a new metanarrative helps us to understand the signiﬁ cance and force of Lyotard’s critical engagement with the post-metanarrative of the fable of solar catastrophe. 5. Second, a story similar to Lyotard’s fable is evident in some forms of transhumanism. Although Lyotard never indicates precisely where he derived the ideas presented in the fable, one possibility is that he picked them up while working in California in the 1980s (he held posts at the University of California, Irvine and San Diego), a time and place during which the loose collection of ideas known as trans-

made by leaders and ordinary people to ignore the possibilities of trustful, sharing relationships that emerge in their lives. In addition, through the lives of Pinkie Brown, Erik Krough, the lieutenant, Rycker, Parkinson, and others, Greene indi- cates that, without relationships based on trust, people become spiritually barren. That is the second truth. A Hobbesian world creates a spiritual wasteland, because existential mistrust of the world leads to spiritual hollowness. There is a dialectic here, because spiritually hollow people choose to live an existence that accords with Thomas Hobbes' philosophy. Greene is quite exceptional in showing the necessary linkage between spiritual hollowness and a Hobbesian world. Look again at his spiritually barren characters. What concerns Aunt Augusta, Erik Krough, Pinkie Brown, and even the Assistant Commissioner in It's a Battlefield7. Only survival and success! Only, as Hobbes put it, "their own preservation, and of

It is difficult to distinguish the workings of Christianity from the much vaster process exploited and given a coherent form by Christianity. I have referred to the world of transgression and I said that one of its most obvious characteristics was its alliance with animal nature. The confusion of animal with human and animal with divine is the mark of very early humanity (and it persists with hunting peoples at least), but the sub- stitution of human deities for animal ones came before Christianity. There was a slow progression of ideas rather than a revolution. Looked at as a whole, the transition from a purely r…

the feeling of self-reproach belongs to this core negativity. From this point of view, we can understand that, whether in its leftwing or in its rightwing version, the true matter is an aversion to the teaching of Judaism or Judeo- Christianity. They are accused of having immersed humanity into guilt, while hypocritically lulling people into a false comfort.134 Of course, it is without surprise that we find under Nietzsche’s pen the plea for jettisoning “the Christian God.” He says, “[T]he prospect cannot be dismissed that the complete and definitive victory of atheism might free man- kind of this whole of guilty indebtedness toward its origin, its causa prima. Atheism and a kind of second innocence belong together.”135 Yes, this Ni- etzschean creed is expected. More surprising, however, is his atheistic “mes- sianism.” He salutes “this Antichrist and antinihilist; this victor over God and nothingness—he must come one day.”136 Is there any additional worth in this

David Peak suggests, a “post-communicative plane of thought” where human language substituting itself for thought and serving as the condition of possibility for thought would be pushed aside. This would be “thinking without language,” as Peak further puts it, and the “contradictory filters of inarticulate lucidity and articulate confusion” would become conditions of communication in this “world-without-us.” See Peak, The Spectacle of the Void , p. 15. 137 Thacker, In the Dust of this Planet , p. 46. 138 Ibid., p. 48. In a sequel to his In the Dust of this Planet , Thacker connects the task of demontology, or the rethinking of the world as unthinkable and away from human- centric thought and language, to a series of historical figures, philosophers, and contem- porary thinkers. One key demontological line of thought is provided by Georges Bataille’s writings, here not so much his writings on acephalous man (Acéphale, as we

to the very possibility of making the creatures endowed with reason, and therefore yearning for logic, feel at home in the world. Just like the ancient astronomers who desperately drew ever new epicycles to defend the geocentric world-order against the unruly evidence of night-sky sightings, the learned theologians quoted in the Book of Job leaned over backwards to defend the unbreak- ability of the sin-and-punishment and virtue-and-reward links against the evidence steadily supplied of pains inﬂ icted on a God-fearing, pious creature, a true paragon of virtue. As if their resounding failure to advance convincing arguments (not to mention clinching proofs) that the credibility of routine explana- tions of evil had emerged unscathed from the acid test of pious Job’s misfortune was not yet enough to dash all prospects of com- prehension, the dense fog in which the allocation of good and bad luck was tightly shrouded did not disperse when God himself

 a p p e n d i x Political Theology as a Rigorous Science we are interested in practice, but we cannot just look at practice. The ordinary is enchanted. It is always already stylized. The or- dinary is jagged, chaotic, unsystematic. It presents itself to us as smooth, flowing, continuous—albeit sometimes surprising. Turning to the ordinary is not as easy as the pragmatist makes it out to seem. In fact, it is impos- sible. The image of the ordinary as jagged, chaotic, and unsystematic is a representation of what cannot be represented. It projects the impasses of the enchanted ordinary onto an imagined disenchanted plane, a plane from which enchantment is to be condemned. Yet it is precisely this maneuver, this commitment to the impossible, which is necessary for efficacious po- litical critique and action. This is the proper root of political theology. Before we can see this commitment to the impossible as political theol-

may not result in a direct change to that system, and individually it is probably impossible to work such a transformation, ‘nonetheless, such a suspension is the only thing left to work for and a necessary condition for there being any change’ (Freyenhagen, 2013: 164). The second element regarding living less wrongly would be to consider the relevance of what Adorno described, in Negative Dialectics, as a new prime directive. This new prime directive involved the responsibility of humanity to ensure that nothing akin to the Holocaust be allowed to occur again. In terms of International Relations, this would appear to indicate a clear focus for the discipline. It could also suggest the possibility of a wider agenda that does not end at the species boundary. Habermas Horkheimer and Adorno’s work was famously criticised by Jürgen Habermas, considered as a second wave Frankfurt School scholar. Habermas raised the issue

The elementals of beneficence are also the elementals of destruction, and only a precarious equilibrium analogous to the metaxy prevents the col- lapse of the former into the latter. The life-affirming blurs into the life- negating, all within the framework of another unstable polarity, and echoes-in the context of natural process-the moral confusion of the gnostic dialectics: salvation/damnation within victim/oppressor. When we recall that natural process was, for the ancient Gnostics, demiurgic process, the leap from Pynchon's weather to cosmic hostility does not seem so far-fetched; and the same recollection will make clear why Pyn- chon must eventually revise this devaluation of nature if he is to escape the gnostic cul-de-sac. For his earliest character, Levine, there is no such escape; he must function amid a chaos of values and sardonic echoes of metaxic collapse.

Introduction 5 of quasi-demonic conspiracy that generates the larger significations of the novel V., and-in a different form-of The Crying of Lot 49. The latter unfolds as an explicit analogue of Pentecostal revelation, with the differ- ence that what is to be revealed is tinged with the moral ambiguities of the animating conspiracy. Finally, in Gravity's Rainbow, this conspiracy draws a substantial portion of its strength from scientism, in effect the worship of scientific method and its attendant axia of control (or Control) through technology. Pynchon makes it clear that scientism is descended from Puritanism, which postulated a divine mandate for the exploitation of earth; and that both find a desirable antithesis in religions such as that of the African Hereros, who consecrated the natural order and the sym- biotic notion of cyclical return. It is from this consecration, augmented ironically by scientific sophistication, that Pynchon draws the normative

appearances, a model that fits nicely with the deep cosmic pessimism of Nihil Unbound’s final pages. The mission of philosophy, Brassier holds, “consists in expediting science’s demolition of the manifest image by kicking away whatever pseudo-transcendental props are being used to shore it up or otherwise inhibit the corrosive potency of science’s metaphysical subtractions” (26). For this reason Churchland, who is often portrayed by his enemies as a grim scientistic liquidator of everything that makes human life worth living, is depicted by Brassier as a humanist sell-out to those merely functional aspects of knowledge that enable the evolution and survival of our species. Nonetheless, Brassier praises both Churchland and Daniel Dennett (b. 1942) for “having driven an irrecusable wedge between our phenomenological self-conception and the material processes through which that conception i…

A Critique of Eugenics as Taming ■ 199 condemns in the strong sense of seeking to exterminate. For this reason, Nietz sche characterizes the negative aspect of natural morality not as true negation, not as annihilation, but as transformation: a natural morality tries to “spiritualize, beautify, deify” a passion, in contrast to anti- natural moralities, which seek to “exterminate” (vernichten), “excise” (ausschnei- den), or “castrate” the passions and, in so doing, to eliminate the variation they bring to human types (TI “Morality” 1). Th is distinction of negative and positive objects of condemnation clari- fi es Nietz sche’s seemingly contradictory call for a “pruning” (beschneiden) of the contemporary individual’s contradictory instincts. Nietz sche argues that because these instincts “destroy one another,” it is necessary that “at least one of these instinct- systems shoul…

of the condition of the poor requires maintaining allegiance to the original intent of the Gospels and focusing Christianity on social justice rather than on theological abstractions. Fourier and Saint-Simon also hold out hope for nonabstract forms of eternal life, which distinguishes them significantly from the utopian and social theory of Comte. In Fourier’s case, the earth’s departed hover about their home planet in the hope that their incarnate brethren will achieve harmony; for Saint-Simon, and especially for the explicitly religious Saint-Simonian movement that followed his death, the rewards of the world to come are linked to one’s treatment of this world’s poor. Houellebecq may follow these thinkers in their worries over capitalism and metaphysics, their celebration of the feminine, and their critique of individualism, but he cannot embellish his representations of uto…

er, is grounded in his fidelity to the notion that existence is a bile enter- prise replete with no possibility for repair, offering a “no saying to the worst, and a further no-saying to the possibility of any other world, in here or out there” (Thacker, “Cosmic Pessimism” 68). For readers, this implicit paradox of the worst holds as its negative index the possibility for a sorrow experienced in an ultimately pessimal mode of self-knowledge in which even death itself, in other words, death as an escape from life, is a disappointment. Death’s disappointment is its non-possibility for escape, but due to death’s de-actualization as nothing- ness it necessitates itself as everything. To think of death, then, is to cultivate a sorrow reared for a mystical meditation on death. Again, as with Georges Bataille in chapter 3, Marguerite Porete’s words from The Mirror of Simple Souls, that “the best I can tell you is that if you under-

Lyle, we are told, ‘saw in the numbers and stock symbols’ that he manipulates, ‘an artful reduction of the external world to printed output, the machine’s coded model of exactitude’. His work gives him the ‘impression of reality disconnected from the resonance of its own senses’, one in which ‘a picture of the competitive mechanism of the world, of greasy teeth engaging on the rim of wheel, was nowhere in evidence’ (Players: p. 70).

an assemblage breaks apart, opening up the possibility for a reassembling of new parts and new relations (not a restoration to a prior unity or the realization of a future unity that recomposes a prior history—again, no Hegel). For Braidotti’s position to work, the phenomena called “anti-life” or even “negative,” which diminish intensity and foreclose new forms of reassembly, are precisely those that have to be struggled against, requiring from us strategies of transposition and resistance. I gather that probably both the toxification of soil and the genetic engineering of food qualify as “anti-life” in this sense. Again, the problem for Braidotti is not that nature is remade or that the materiality of life is re-formed—that is the inevitable movement of life. Rather, the problem, is that these specific forms seek to halt the life process itself, its dynamism, relationality, and…

Preliminary Expectoration 27 yet about myself, that is, my mortality. If I knew it, I could not sacriﬁ ce my innocence of it. I call this syndrome, in “Alas a Dirty Th ird” and “Th omas Bernhard’s Rant,” dirtiness: Th e paradigm is the ﬁ gure in the joke or logical exemplum who has a smear of dirt on his forehead that he cannot see— when the dirt had been visible, in the garden or ﬁ eld, it was not yet dirty— though a master teacher, a magister mortis, a living or dead adult can teach him how to infer its existence. In each case a child comes to an adult to learn death indirectly as some- thing external (though adhesive) and alien and eventual rather than immanent and imminent; thus dirtiness and adulthood are the mutually sullying doctrines of the present entropic, un- believing sermon. Death appears, on this understanding, not as an individual immediate reality as in authentic Heidegger nor as the condition of brotherhood across otherness but as an

Georges Keita, for instance, condemns ende- mic corruption in the Malian administration, while recognizing that he is implicated in this by his profession. The obstacles posed by African apathy and despair are also acknowledged in a scene where Chaka refuses to repeat his comments about the socially destructive impact of Structural Adjustment Programmes on the grounds that ‘no-one will listen’.

can be non-humans as well. Serres mainly explores these quasi-objects following Dumézil’s tripartite hypothesis: quasi-objects in form of a fetish (Jupiter), an army or a weapon (Mars) or commodities (Quirinus). While all three types of quasi-objects put an end to mimetic violence, they also paradoxically create new forms of violence, in the form of sacrifices to maintain this social order. But similar to the Group of Ten (Groupe des Dix) and especially Jean-Pierre Dupuy, Serres is also interested in how this logic of sacrificial violence is at work in science and technology, embodied not only by technical objects such as the atomic bomb but also by the academic practice of critique. The two final chapters explore Serres’s alternative to these violent quasi- objects. In the seventh chapter, I look at how Serres connects science and religion through an examination of the metaphor…

One of the photographs, however - a rather nondescript one of a room, an open door, a mirror - belongs to the replicant Leon, recovered by Deckard in a search of his hotel room. Deckard inserts this photograph in a piece of equipment that is ultimately revealed as a machine for analyzing images. Uncannily responding to Deckard's voiced commands, the machine enlarges the image, isolates various sections, and enlarges them further. The resultant play of colors and grain, focus and its loss, is aesthetically provocative beyond the demonstration of technical prowess and control over the image. Deckard's motivation, the desire for knowledge that is fully consistent with his positioning in the film as the detective figure of film noir, is overwhelmed by the special ef…

Whence the split between its utopian and cynical elements in his work. The subtle artiﬁces with which it repre- sents inanimate objects correspond to what Marx calls the ‘‘theological ni- ceties’’ of the commodity. The concrete expression of this is clearly found in the spe´cialite´—a category of goods which appears at this time in the luxu- ries industry. World exhibitions construct a universe of specialties. The fan- tasies of Grandville achieve the same thing. They modernize the universe. In his work, the ring of Saturn becomes a cas…
