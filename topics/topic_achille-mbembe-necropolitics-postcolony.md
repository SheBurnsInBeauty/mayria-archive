various historical and geographical contexts. Biopolitics better rephrased as necropolitics, Mbembe seems to imply, is concerned with the submission of “natural or simple life” (as Agamben put it), or zoe-, to that power that will terminate or deny it. In this manner, Mbembe’s necropower is much closer to the old sovereign power to put to death or to invent a succession of threats and dangers that demand that the lives of human subjects be surrendered (if not sacriﬁced) to an absolute and arbitrary power of destruction (through war, terror, colonial rule, and so on). Mbembe’s approach to necropolitics thus combines biopolitical frames of understanding (about the emphasis placed on dead life) with more traditional perspectives on sovereign force and violence (a power to put to death). One might suggest that, far from taking the biopolitical approach beyond Foucault, Mbembe actually return…

Trauma and Power in Postcolonial Literary Studies 111 re-constructed by communities in narratives of loss and wounding. It is the function of narratives to provide expression to collective responses to the profoundly destructive acts of colonialism, material as well as immaterial, such as the suppression or profanation of sacred indigenous rituals and values. Colonialism’s traumatic aftermath con- tinues until the present day; a condition, as Achille Mbembe explains, known as the post-colony: “the effective continuation of the authority structures of the colony in the post-imperial nation despite ‘flag inde- pendence’” (Mbembe 2010: 7). Postcolonial literature is a major con- tributor to the trauma process the sociocultural construction of trauma in the postcolony. In postcolonial literary criticism, then, an important advance would be the mapping out of lines of relationality …

see in the response of humans to zombies in most zombie literature), and Mbembe recognizes this in his model of necropolitics. Underlying Mbembe’s reading of necropolitics, both contemporary and historical, is an inherent distrust of the Other: The perception of the existence of the Other as an attempt on my life, as a mortal threat or absolute danger whose biophysical elimination would strengthen my potential to life and security—this, I suggest, is one of the many imaginaries of sovereignty characteristic of both early and late modernity itself [18]. This model of necropolitics can be seen in the majority of zombie literature, directed towards both human and nonhuman Others. This perspective, fueled by paranoia, suggests an economy of life that is incapable of being sustained for extended periods without crash - ing. Mbembe himself purports as much when he asks, “What is the relationship between politics and death in those systems that can

subject’s condition as an ongoing dynamic always in formation and reforma- tion with the forces and powers of the world in which it is encountered. As Chun, Lipsitz and Shin have it in their essay in the Signs Intersectionality issue, ‘it is important for progressive politics that people derive their identities from their politics’,20 rather than vice versa, meaning that, in the essay as in inter- sectional analysis no preformed identity by neo-liberalism, colonialism, racism, sexism or imperialism is accepted as given. When Weizman in his models builds towards the truth of some catastrophic local event, there is, perforce, constructed a political and social truth of those subjects involved in it. Mbembe’s necropolitics as a neo-colonial political reality reveals truths about his own subjecthood as a black African in engagement with that reality. Equally that deﬁnitionally relative scope of the essay is an acknowledgement

does not entail a change in thought style. In terms of the diagram, Nefolovhodwe continues his movement along the A–C diagonal very successfully, and at the end of the novel is happy to be “invited to dinners by white people who held the reins of government” (Mda 1995: 206). We can conclude from this that the materialist and indi- vidualist thought style appears to provide a shield against secondary traumatization, that of living amidst death and ways of dying. This conclusion is supported by a similar dynamic along the A–C diagonal that is observable in Mda’s later novel The Heart of Redness (2000). The setting here is democratic South Africa, but it is also the trauma of history, a long-standing tribal conflict deriving from the historic event known as the Xhosa cattle killing, which is part of the legacy of nineteenth-century colonialism. In this novel Xoliswa Ximiya is a c…

10 . introduction what Achille Mbembe addresses as necropolitics and the economy of biopower composed by problematic definitions of being human.19 Funk provides a reor- ganization of the senses to overcome necropolitics and biopower. Uses of the erotic may interrupt the economy of biopower, but these uses have not been able to counter necropolitics as Fred Wilderson’s work has so dogmatically stated.20 Yet, as my close readings and theoretical interventions of black cultural texts and performances explain, when funk is deployed alongside uses of the erotic, necropolitics can be avoided. I extend Lorde’s concept of the erotic and honor her request to work fully to understand the diametrically opposite uses of the sexual (“pornography and eroticism”) by insisting that this mission is as much a question about (colonizing) aesthetics as it is ethics. That is, what constitutes the ethical difference between pornography and eroticism is not and can never

postmodernes comme on va le voir. A travers cette généalogie rapide et finalement cette archéologie non ex- haustive de la production littéraire postcoloniale de l’Afrique francophone subsaharienne la visée première était d’établir les connexions idéologiques, éthiques et thématiques qui servent de soubassement à cette littérature. Au- delà de la diversité des œuvres et au-delà de l’hétérogénéité des moments considérés (1965–1980: critique des indépendances ; 1980–1990: dictature ; 1990–2000: guerres civiles et génocide, enfants-soldats, exil ou encore im- migration/émigration), il s’agissait à coup sûr d’indiquer les pistes possibles d’une lecture postcoloniale de cette littérature. En effet, la théorie postcolo- niale peut permettre une lecture dynamique et renouvelée de la littérature ro- manesque négro-africaine francophone pour peu qu’elle se fixe un objet, un contenu et une …

the material contexts of colonialism and apartheid, including economic ‘modernization’, apartheid’s “separate development” policy, and the postapartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Duncan shows how literary hauntings in South Africa across the twentieth and twenty-ﬁ rst centuries function as “echoes of experiences and events for which there is no proper place” (279) in the historical record. By permitting a glimpse of “imperial modernity’s unlived alternatives”, however, ghosts in South African literatures “participate, with varying degrees of self-reﬂ exivity, in forms of dissent” (287). These spectres play a number of roles, exposing “the limitations—the failures—of sanitized narratives of domination in South Africa” (281) or, in postapartheid literature, insisting “on the basic impossibility of recollection” (286) and restitution in the wake of injustice and exploitation.

136 slaves, as colonial subjects, through internalized racism, or other forms. In relation to slavery as necropolitical subjection, Cameroonian philosopher Achille Mbembe asserts that in the commercialization of the body, “a per- son’s humanity is dissolved to the point where it becomes possible to say that the slave’s life is possessed by the master. Because the slave’s life is like a ‘thing,’ possessed by another person, the slave existence appears as a perfect figure of a shadow” (22). As if it were a demon, and not content with just possessing the body, the slave owner seeks to possess the very life of the slave and to be able to decide whether he or she lives or dies, in the ultimate expression of political sovereignty. Both as a shadow of a former person or as a terrified human possessed by a demon, the subject becomes a passive passenger who watches what happens but cann…

a work that claims to be exorcising African literature of dom- ination by aesthetic and critical Eurocentrism, has come to be equated with a deeply conservative endeavor to retain a purist form of African identity in an impractical and regressive man- ner. In this polemical work of soul-searching that advocates a return to African sources within literature and cultural theory and clamors for deep immersion in African aesthetics as cen- tral to the project of reinventing an authentic African identity in the aftermath of colonialism, authors Chinweizu (b. 1943), Onwuchekwa Jemie (b. 1940), and Ihechukwu Madubuike (b. 1943) also present exoticized notions of African culture and African tradition, thereby diminishing the force of their argu- ment. Critics have, however, never addressed the deeper ques- tion of Eurocentrism that Chinweizu and colleagues raise and have instead gleefully exploited the glaring simplification of African identity in Toward the Decolonization. However, the

particularly African.13 Mbembe argues that in Africa, the twin institutions of slavery and colo- nialism are the events “through which Africa was born into modernity.”14 I would add that missionary efforts with their attendant introduction of European-­style education were also a part of that first, culturally violent, experience of modernity. In the postcolony, imperial modernity is en- tangled with tradition, indigenous practices, independence legacies, and global economic flows such that a particular moment in political history cannot be read simply in the linear terms of cause and effect. An instance of political violence could be interpreted through multiple strands: mis- sionary conversion, colonial exploitation, and slave-­trade motivations. Postcolonial African time is experienced as an entangling of each of these threads among other contemporary lines: “As an age, the postcolony en- closes multiple durées made up of discontinuities, reversals, inertias, and

participate while, at the same time, also making way for something else to emerge. In effecting an impasse, Aziz and Anna put in practice their own ver- sions of a radical cosmopolitan politics that gives shape to a new postco- lonial horizon. In this sense, these novels suggest that, in some regards, the “post” in postcolonial is indeed the “post” in postpolitics. As I argued at the beginning of this chapter, the term postcolonial signals not the end of empire itself but the need for a truly democratic politics that tackles the relations of domination that defne both the colonial moment and the new epoch following the process of decolonization. However, in their projec- tions of an emancipatory future, the novels do not offer idealistic solutions. Rather, they reject in very realistic ways the continuation of the consensual regime governing empire, which comes at a high personal…

the postmodern postcolonialism concomitant with the likes of Homi Bhabha and Salman Rushdie (cf. Lazarus 2011). Twenty-first-century postcolonial Gothic retains the anti-colonial politics and the problema- tisation of the ‘post’ in postcolonialism central to its twentieth-century forebears. But as the effects of (neo)imperial violence continue to mani- fest in the present day, modes of expression and forms of criticism take a more materialist approach. Contemporary postcolonial Gothic provides a language for ­re-engaging with the political realities of the post/neo-colonial present, speaking truths that are structurally repressed elsewhere. Voicing a common anxiety about the Gothic as ‘unrealistic and frivolous’, Teresa Goddu notes that its ‘apparent lack of connection to reality and intel- lectual purpose has made it troubling to use in conjunction with African- American writers…

Chapter 11 Necropolitics On ‘Necropolitics’ by Achille Mbembe (2003) The question of sovereignty lies at the heart of what Achille Mbembe has called ‘Necropolitics’.1 Yet as the Brexit debate and the Trumpist slogan ‘Take back Control’ recently demonstrated, there is much popular confusion over the concept of sovereignty. It is at least arguable how much that confusion is the result of manipulation of mass opinions and emotions by sinister and powerful political interests. Without going into that for the moment, it is nonetheless instructive to note the comments by one interested party on the Brexit negotiations just as they reached crisis stage in late 2020. The UK–EU talks were stalling, with allegations that EU aims and proposals regarding rights to ﬁshing in UK waters would infringe upon UK sovereignty. The Spanish foreign minister at the time, Arancha González Laya pointed out in a some- what exasperated interview she gave on Sky TV that ‘trade agreements are not

184 I Achille Mbembe Such is the logic of heroism as classically understood: to execute others while holding one's own death at a distance. In the logic of martyrdom, a new semiosis of killing emerges. It is not nec­ essarily based on a relationship between form and matter. As I have already indicated, the body here becomes the very uniform of the martyr. But the body as such is not only an object to protect against danger and death. The body in itself has neither power nor value. The power and value of the body result from a process of abstraction based on the desire for eternity. In that sense, the mar­ tyr, having established a moment of supremacy in which the subject over­ comes his own mortality, can be seen as laboring under the sign of the future. In other words, in death the future is collapsed into the present. In its desire for eternity, the besieged body passes throug…

is situated at the nexus of the postcolonial, the Gothic, and the eco- critical and it contests the anodyne version of post-apartheid South Africa (the so-called ‘rainbow nation’), evoking a nightmare of fear and transgression instead. A way out of the circle of terror, and the bleak new postcolonial tyranny that is depicted, is implied in the novel’s moral philosophy. Head draws on Coetzee’s The Lives of Animals (1999), and its concern with animal rights in order to show how the ethical vision of Disgrace offers another kind of transgression to received ideas about ethics and politics. Head’s essay thus brings together Gothic notions of transgression with the postcolonial in order to construct an important reassessment of post-apartheid South Africa. With the exception of Spivak’s landmark essay, all of the essays in this volume have been specially commissioned for this volume. The dive…

xvi The Black Consciousness Reader corruption among the elite, and unaccountable and patronising political leadership is the story of post-democratic life. And that story is a horror. Deep reflection on race relationships between people in the diaspora and colonies such as South Africa raised awareness of the painful position of black people. It reminds us that the only response was a justifiable programme against the entrenched socioeconomic order. But the relatively unchanged state of that order in a post-democratic South Africa has left black people, workers and students restless, and increasingly protesters, as they seek a re- examination of what was demanded of a new Establishment’s institutions and policies. More and not less was what was expected from a black- dominated administration. It is startling that the issues which lie behind our current public discontent are primarily the same as those that have long

heavy-smelling pools of slime, the crabs, the carcasses and scum. (JEN, p. 98; V, pp. 112–13) This is not an expression of an abstract misanthropy. Its very particular instance is French colonial society. Delirium is the only mode of narrative appropriate to colonialism. For colonialism is a delirium, a madness in which reason is reduced to the status of dream, and becomes the unpresentable, even the sublime: Such vital energy as was not sapped by malaria, thirst and the heat of the sun was consumed by hatreds so bitter and insistent that many of the residents [colons] used to die in their tracks, poisoned by themselves, like scorpions. This state of virulent chaos, however, was encircled by a serried cordon of police, like crabs in a bucket. It was in vain that the officials whined; the governor could always recruit as many shabby levies as he needed to keep his colony in order, as many…

non-human and, ultimately, through cultural narratives and national expressions of power and history, as extinct.7 Historically, as ideological as well as physical obstacles to expansion and nation building, the indigenous peoples of North America were constructed as ‘native surplus’ (Wolfe 404), and thus designated for elimination. Similarly, Achille Mbembe argues in ‘Necropolitics’ (2003) that such colonial logics produce ‘peculiar spatial institutions’ (26), such as reservations that were planned for the purpose of control and containment of the ‘hated enemy’ (Precarious Life 17). Native bodies have been subjected to analogous forms of erasure, dispossession and removal, including forceful sterilization, stolen children and other forms of ‘invisible killing’ (Mbembe 30). Thus, with its origins in colonialism, necropower cultivates various forms of population control or material destruction of bodies that are only possible if certain bodies become

Though he introduced his 1879 Principia. of Ethnokgy with a fawning dedication to the Earl ofShaftesbury which would not find favour among Africentrists these days, his arguments in this final publication do prefigure the tone and content of contemporary Africalogical thought in an uncanny manner. Delany has been identified by Molefi Kete Asante as a pioneer in this field47 and makes an attractive ancestor for Africentrists thanks to endearing traits like his willingness to don his dashiki while deliv- ering lectures on Africa in the Town Hall, the Baptist church, and "the colored school" in Chatham, Ontario, where he made his home in exile. Apart from his sartorial and ideological proclivities, the proximity to Africa in Delany's family history has the effect of making his political choi…

in the scientific sense.’ Whereas some aspects of nature are respected and conserved among Shona, others are abused and exploited. For Taringa, this exploitation and abuse also affects animals, in spite of the existence of the totemism principle among the Shona. In analysing Hove and Zimunya’s representation of nature and rural landscape, I use what I refer to, after Dana Mount (2013: 21), as ecopostco- lonialism or postcolonial ecocriticism. By definition, ecopostcolonialism ‘is the study of the representation of nature and the environment in a dialogue with postcolonialism’ (Mount 2013: 2). Ecopostcolonialism rejects the ten- dency of first-wave Euro-American ecocriticism to see environmental con- sciousness as the preserve of a Euro-American mindset and to construct the global South and its literatures as ‘an exotic new arrival on the scene of environmental consciousness’ (Mount 2013: 2–3). Contrary to this percep-

It was therefore not surprising that many Tsonga people (commonly known as the Shangaans) living in the surrounding townships were victimized and subjected to severe torture by angry mobs who thought they were Zimbabweans. It must also be noted that this was not the first time xenophobic violence on immigrants was making headline news. The Star issue of May 13 contained a brief record of xenophobic incidences that had taken place in various townships around Pretoria and Johannesburg between January and April 2008.

4 I am aware of the political implications of the French government’s vision of la francophonie, and also of the apparent difficulty of labeling postcolonial works pub- lished by Algerians before 1962. Nonetheless, I subscribe to the arguments defend- ing the terms, advanced by Charles Fosdick and David Murphy in Francophone Postcolonial Studies: A Critical Introduction (London: Arnold, 2003). Although I do not follow her usage, Debra Kelly provides an excellent critical overview of the theoretical implications of our choice of terms in the introduction to her Autobiogra- phy and Independence: Selfhood and Creativity in North African Postcolonial Writing in French (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2005). 5 (Kateb, Soliloques preface).

of death’ by offering a philosophical/postcolonial reading of how the West continues to be implicated with, and partly responsible for, recent genocidal horrors perpetuated on African soil. As he provocatively asks: ‘what closer reenactment of Kurtz’s atrocities than the Rwandan genocide?’ The horror, Warin argues, has not stopped to plague Africa and is still, in many ways, the horror of the West. Part 3, ‘The Affect of Ideology’, concentrates on the affective dimension of Lacoue-Labarthe’s reading of the horror and argues that the psychic dimension of Heart of Darkness needs to be reconsidered in the context of larger social forces that affect the entire body politic. Jacques Lacan is a key reference in ‘The Horror of the West’, and the contributors in this section do much to account for catastrophic forms of desires that haunt Western culture as a whole. Thus, Stephen Ross builds on Lacoue-Labarthe’s reference

Foreign journalists have insisted on its racial and ethnic speciﬁcity.13 The domestic media have, however, been more cautious. Early in the life of the commission, Truth Commission Special Report ran a feature on what it termed the “symbolic reburial” of bodies. Although a white psychologist was interviewed for com- mentary, all of those presented as approaching the commission for “rebur- ial,” or just to ﬁnd information, were black.14 In a subsequent program, presenter Max du Preez, a respected leftist Afrikaans journalist, sought to dispel the impression that this was “a black cultural thing.” Featured was the widow…

we can mediate it to our fellows. This is especially true when postcolonial meets postmodern; for what the postmodern reader seems to demand of its Africa is all-too-close to what modernism - as documented in William Rubin’s ‘Primi­ tivism’ exhibit of 1985 - demanded of it. The role that Africa - like the rest of the Third World - plays for Euro-American postmodernism - like its better- documented significance for modernist art - must be distinguished from the role postmodernism might play in the Third World; what that might be it is, I think, too early to tell. And what happens will happen not because we pronounce upon the matter in theory, but out of the changing everyday practices of African cultural life. 442

We can’t get work because of you’: in September 1998 a crowd returning from a march in Pretoria throw three migrant workers to their deaths (Comaroff, 2002: 788). Jean and John Comaroff cite this example as one in many of the recent reports that document a rise in cases connecting witches and zombies to class, inter-­ethnic and economic tensions in southern Africa. Contemporary figures of dread are, they suggest, conjured out of the economic upheavals and shifts in immigration motivated by new labour practices. Witchcraft and zombi­ fication, then, are linked to African ‘immigrants from elsewhere on the continent, whose demonization is an equally prominent feature of the postcolonial scene. Together these proletarian pariahs make visible a phantom history, a local chapter in a global story of changing relations of labor to capital, of production and consumption’ (Comaroff, 2002:

from the “body” and “flesh.”50 Today we can identify this “flesh” in numerous modes of existence as having a status below the “threshold of the human,” below the level of “humanity,” while the “bodies” are “let to live,” “abandoned,” etc. Mbembe propos- es that the common trajectory of those modes of existence is the universalization of the Black condition, since it most accurately summarizes the state of universal humanity in current times.51 Secondly, the aforementioned “effects of blackness,” once pre- sented as a form of the “disease” of the colonial head, are, para- doxically, gradually gaining the status of an epistemological “cure” to contemporary “diseases of the head.” For, as Mbembe’s 46 Achille Mbembe, “Democracy in the Age of Dynamism,” Lecture at the Hutchins Center for African American Research, Harvard University, Cambridge, December 4, 2013. 47 Meg Armstrong, “‘The Effects of Blackness’: Gender, Race, and the Sub-

over the next ﬁfty years or so. The legacy of colonialism has been one of the most far reaching inﬂuences both on the former colonies and also on Britain itself, both in terms of its position in the new world order after 1945, and also in the changing nature of its home population. The term postcolonialism has been coined to deﬁne this new state of aﬀairs and a series of theories and discourses has arisen in many ﬁelds to explain and assess the impact of this enor- mous shift in the political organization of the world. Britain has continued to maintain links with many of the former colonies through the establishment of the Commonwealth, which is an asso- ciation of many of the countries that used to be ruled by Britain. This continued association has also aﬀected the pattern of migra- tion and has been a signiﬁcant feature of Britain’s population demo- graphic in the years following the …

or to imagine the pro­cess of decolonizing archives as a purely “secular” proj­ect, is to literalize the very logics of Mbembe’s “chronophagy.” In other words, even as we attempt to reconstruct histories of colonized pasts, it is equally urgent that such efforts fully and inventively incorporate nonsec- ular (in this case, Islamist) writings about subjecthood and freedom.

SpeCifically, it is from the vantage point of race­ making and nation-making that his interest in this discourse on children's sexual precocities dovetails with our own. If this was one of the prin­ Cipal discursive sites where bourgeois culture defined and defended its interests, in colonial perspective it was also one of the key sites in which racial transgressions were evident and national identities formed. It was a discourse in which the distribution and education of desire was lodged in that "tiny, sexually saturated, familial space" (HS47). This space con­ tained and revamped intrafamilial relations, as Foucault argued. But it also did something more. It was here that those with other class and cultural

turn to both institutional and popular arenas where death and citizen- ship existed in metaphoric relation.The social death of slavery, phobic concern for sexual purity, protopsychological research of mesmerism, séances and clairvoyants of spiritualism, postbellum naturalization of blacks, juridical circumscription of rights—all these cultural echoes of mortality and impressions of the afterlife prepare subjects to live as citizens of the nation-state. Necro Citizenship contends that abstract citizenship exploits the literal biological fact of mortality to eﬀect a political death in which subjects alternately suﬀer and enjoy the de- politicization of cultural memories and social textures that reside in human life. The U.S. democratic state loves its citizens as passive subjects, unre- sponsive to political issues, unmoved by social stimuli, and unaroused by enduring injustices. The abstract parameters of citizenship are in

Importantly, the witnesses’ complaints against the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization and the G8 are punctuated with allusions to African co-responsibility, echoing the logic of Death in Timbuktu. Georges Keita, for instance, condemns ende- mic corruption in the Malian administration, while recognizing that he is implicated in this by his profession. The obstacles posed by African apathy and despair are also acknowledged in a scene where Chaka refuses to repeat his comments about the socially destructive impact of Structural Adjustment Programmes on the grounds that ‘no-one will listen’. At every turn, the highly individualized testimonies presented in Bamako and their nuanced allocation of responsibility unsettle the reiﬁed binary opposition Ethics, race, postcolonialism 59

the influence of the time in which he wrote his reply to Khadafi, the mid- 1970s. Shohat, on the other hand, is writing in the post- era: post-modernist, post-colonialist and post-Zionist. The focus in the idea of the “post-” here is on new modes and forms of colonial actions rather than on something that moves beyond.27 When applied to the above point, this results both in continuities and in discontinuities. In other words, experiencing a phase of othering within what is imagined as one's own country, as the Mizrahim did, has a sobering effect of post-naiveté. And therefore we can conclude that Mizrahim from Arab countries have indeed undergone a twofold suffering: from being Jews in Arab countries and from being Arabs in Israel. Zionism looked down on them, racialising them for being part Arabs, and in this sense

Addressed to a forum of human rights, the demand for funeral rites—for and before the other—evokes, from the law, another “law,” perhaps that which Derrida gives the name “justice.” Summoned before the dead, the commission at once takes up and forecloses this responsibility. THE BODY Observers of the human rights violation hearings have been struck by the frequency with which witnesses testifying as victims claim the restitution of a body or of missing body parts. The survivors seek to accord the dead proper funeral rites and to enlist the aid of the commission in doing so.11 Although not anticipated by the commission and not budgeted for, more than ﬁfty bodies, many those of African National Congress guerri…

remains of bodily, spatial, and ideal losses constituting the future histories of postapartheid South Africa. In this section, we cull a brief but interested intellectual history of loss from three broad periods of Western thought—ancient, late antiquity/ medieval, and Renaissance—and from selected critical engagements with melancholia’s scattered genealogies.10 Following Benjamin’s provocative lead, we bring a particular history of loss to bear on twentieth-century mo-

inequalities of the city that indicates the potential limits of the postmodern project. Developing this line of thought, Upstone charts the ways in which recent post- colonial writing navigates London’s imperial urban space in order to address key aspects of the migrant experience, such as inter-community violence, Americanism versus Africanism, and classed and gendered prejudice. Space has always been a highly contentious issue in Africa and, as the next chapter shows, this is particularly the case in the context of contemporary urban Africa. In ‘Reading urban spaces in African texts’, Tim Woods investigates how contemporary writers from countries such as Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa have sought to represent the impact of Africa’s uneven urban development on the lived spaces of the city. As he illustrates, the shanty town, the high-tech mall, the residential tower, the gated communit…

She subsequently introduces the idea of comparison in extre- mis to describe the ways in which postcolonial texts such as Medoruma Shun’s short story “Hope” explore the double bind of politics and eth- ics. Comparison in extremis emerges out of a context of unacknowledged suffering, confronting the impossible choice between the anguish of subaltern invisibility on the one hand and ethical prohibitions against killing on the other. Abederrahmane Sissako’s ﬁlm Bamako, meanwhile, offers a revealing representation of the discontinuities between African struggles against neocolonialism and the people on whose behalf such struggles ostensibly take place. Richard Handler distinguishes between a positivist anthropology that aspires toward a taxonomy of cultural similarities and differences in order to advance general hypotheses and causal claims, and an interpretative anthr…

Postcolonial texts, like many minority or marginalized works, often do evince a number of common features, as I have demonstrated. Re- peatedly we observe these authors taking one or more of the basic ele- ments of narrative and providing a multiple, collective entity instead of the conventional singular ﬁ gure of traditional Western narrative. We ﬁ nd merged speakers and a collective consciousness in narration; joint plots of multiple individuals and extended groups; a polychronological tem- porality within which those plots are related; and the use of multiple, collective, and fused characterization to tell the stories of groups. These features are particularly evident in “we” narratives, where the choice of narrating pronoun easily produces a shared perspective, focalization, nar- ratee, collective narrative agent, and plot that easily transcend the typical range of a conventi…

the Sudanese even as it remained, for the British, a ‘‘barbarous custom,’’ she shows—as Bastian, Wiener, and Bauer do in their own chapters—that attention to women’s bodies can illuminate how issues of bodily transgression are bound up in the differentiated organization of moral orders. Colonial European perceptions of Africans as dirty may be slow to die, but contemporary Herero’s obsessive concerns with cleanliness have nonetheless managed to confound American visitors—who, in turn, often appear unclean to their hosts. This does not imply that all Herero are characteristically clean, Deborah Durham notes in her lively discussion of the perceptions of cleanli- ness, bathing, and dirtiness held by the residents of an urban village in Bo- tswana. While not all situations call for careful grooming, baths are nonethe- less crucial components of the fabric of civic and domestic life—the prop…

76 Contemporary Literature and the End of the Novel of Christianity.” The notion that the soul “continues to exist as itself after the body dies” reveals, according to JC, “an incapacity to think of a world from which the thinker is absent” (153–54). Such a denegation of death is one possible response to the loss of seemingly self-evident notions of individuality and existential meaning, and one that Coetzee’s late novels categorically dismiss: against the wishful perpetuation of a self-reliant self, they outline new and diminished forms of life that respond to the realities of creatureliness rather than to the demands of outmoded fictions of individuality. Coetzee’s late fictions imagine sur- vival differently. As Chris Danta has suggested, they are less interested in the afterlife than in “afterdeath” (“Melancholy Ape” 129): the aftermath of a loss that has shattered the very terms in which we would normally

Cape province. An indication of his capacity for change is given in the scene in which he repeats, rather mechanically, the view of the ‘Church Fathers’ that, unlike the souls of humans, the souls of animals ‘are tied to their bodies and die with them’. Yet he makes this remark when Lucy has found him asleep in the cage of the abandoned old bulldog bitch, Katy (p. 78). His body inclines him towards an afﬁnity that he is not yet able to articulate. Indeed, his most crass pronouncement comes in the following scene, in reply to Bev Shaw’s sense that he likes animals: ‘I eat them, so I suppose I must like them, some parts of them’, he quips (p. 81). Coetzee is careful to discredit Lurie in this scene in which his shameful appraisal of Bev Shaw’s unattractiveness is given in lingering detail (through Lurie’s focalization, pp. 81–2). This is before the attack on the farm, with the physical assault on Lurie and the multiple rape

African society (Spleth 1985: 31). More recently, Patrice Nganang (Cameroon) explores the usage of Negritude’s logic and epistemology in promoting genocides and massacres on the African continent, and points to Senghor’s reticence in demanding justice for Africans who were slaughtered by colonial powers. He cites these two criticisms as central deficits of Negritude. Nganang proclaims the death of Senghor’s philosophy, stating: ‘Rwanda is the grave of Negritude’ (Nganang 2009: 93). Negritude provided a delineation of an African Personality, an ethos that stressed cooperation, and an African ontology and aesthetic. Although nebulous and indeterminate as an ideology, some of its tenets were used by many African revolutionaries and statesmen who utilized their particular definition of socialism to defend their national institutions and ideologies. It continues to be popular and influential …

Perhaps the thoughts most pertinent to the South African situation in terms of emancipation came from Biko: ‘It becomes more necessary to see the truth as it is if you realise that the only vehicle for change are these people who have lost their personality. ‘The first step therefore is to make the black man come to himself; to pump back life into his empty shell; to infuse him with pride and dignity, to remind him of his complicity in the crime of allowing himself to be misused and therefore letting evil reign supreme in the country of his birth.’ [www.marxists.org/archive; Balibar, 2002b; Biko, 1978] Restoring black culture Speaking on New York’s Democracy Now!

vation of soil for growing plants. Indeed, over the dead body of an English soldier, the notion of cul- ture deconstructs itself so as to show the visceral materiality that was always the hidden kernel inscribed in the poetic mediality of Brooke’s metaphors. The body, growing after death, emerges as the uncanny inversion of cultural values and institutions that increase in a foreign place, having been brought there by imperialist armed forces. And the poetic image of commemoration Brooke creates is also that of the dead soldier he will, in fact, become before the war is over. Implicitly English culture experiences an afterlife in this war zone precisely in the shape of bodily haunting: the rich foreign soil contains ‘richer dust’, English remains still representing the country the soldier fought and died for (Roberts, 1996: 71). Brooke’s poetical rendition turns a metaphori- cal relation into a literal one. The soldier, who symbolically stands in

is distinct in nature but not perhaps in effect from the previous colonial projects. The current postcolonial period is one of economic integration as well as exploitation. This period presents new obstacles to those who seek to understand and to change the developing world. These obstacles can be seen in sharp relief, particularly when we understand the contemporary urbanization of much of the developing world. More people now live in cities than in the countryside (although, ironically, in the US a plurality of people now inhabit the suburbs). This urbanization, or mega-urbanization, intersects with economic exploitation in explosive ways. Related to but distinct from postcolonialism is a fifth change: the emergence, particularly in the 1990s, of identity politics. Feminist politics, black politics, and gay and lesbian politics all staked their claim to recognition during this period. One might date the birth of identity politics

(More recently, the photographs are of whole families of indigent villagers dying of AIDS.) These sights carry a double message. They show a suffering that is outra- geous, unjust, and should be repaired. They confirm that this is the sort of thing which happens in that place. The ubiquity of those photographs, and those horrors, cannot help but nourish belief in the inevitability of tragedy in

colonized the voice denied to them, often in an amended version of the former colonial language, to emphasize the message of self-determination to oppressor and oppressed alike. 3-SECOND PLOT Postcolonial literature refers to literary works written since decolonization in the 1950s and 1960s by writers from countries once colonized by former European empires. Postcolonial literature is a term applied to work by non-European writers in continents whose nations were once colonies of European empires, implying that these works have been shaped primarily by the experience or historical legacy of colonialism. This is certainly the case in novels by black African writers, such as Kenyan author Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o’s Devil on the Cross (1980), which investigates the social malaise inherited from colonization and its concomitant capitalism, though the term applies equal…

10 Jeremy Harding this conscious choice is not simply a function of African oral tradition. The question, more often, has been how poets— or novelists who turn to po- etry, as Achebe did in Beware Soul Brother (1972)— can express the urgency that circumstances so often impel them to feel. Among these are injustice, poverty, the fraying of post-colonial ideals, and the rise of corrupt or tyran- nical government. In Nigeria, in the decade before the Biafran war (1967-70), the colonial experience had been acknowledged and explored in depth. The major works on the subject are by Achebe (Things Fall Apart, 1958, No Longer at Ease, I960, and Arrow of God, 1964) and, in East Africa, by Ngugi (Weep Not, Child, 1964, The River Between, 1965, and A Grain of Wheat, 1967). Both writers had shown how the encounter with colonial authority set up inescapable con- flicts within African societies. The village or the extended rural community

ilized,” can be a great comfort to the popular imagination. Interestingly, though, some of the autopsy scenes depicted in popu- lar culture today seem to have taken a huge swerve from the colonial pro- ject of the early modern West. Specifically, these are autopsies depicted on television programs such as The X-Files, Millennium, and Alien Autopsy (all Fox network). Of course, the autopsy deployed in these programs is still a form of colonization of the body, alien or homegrown, but now the social tables seem to be turned. The West depicted in these shows is expe- riencing the threat of colonization from some more powerful outside force. Programs like these, which are being produced in the most imper- ial nation on earth, constitute allegories of colonization of the West, a development that is really quite extraordinary in the history of modern Western culture. I would argue that such programs demonstrate how the postcolonial condition is being experienced through the position of a

67 Reviving . . . Corpses with the literary work of remembering. Recognizing the power of the corpse itself to keep historical memory alive, these poems remind us that even the most abject body has a story to tell. A corpse is never completely silent, for, as any forensic pathologist knows, its materiality speaks volumes about the circumstances of its passing, the when, where, and how of its demise. A historical corpse poem puts these stories into words, inventing paradoxical new grammars to articulate the terrifying new realities of mod- ern death. literary In the range of corpse poems this chapter has addressed so far, figures of speech come to stand in for the missing or forgotten corpses of history. Yet events like the lynching of African Ameri- cans or the massacre of European Jewry cannot be comfortably contained in any poem, including the unconventional corpse poem. Language can, at best, only imperfectly fill the void the

politics to a social or political imaginary. Paul Patton further develops this post-colonial politics by tracking irreducible difference as it composes and decomposes the law. In the last essay in this section Alfred López exposes the imaginative site of post-colonial political construction in Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. The untranslatable metaphor of this title opens linguistic space for a pre-political feeling of difference before there is language to capture it. The concluding set of essays becomes witness to the enigma of difference at its most extreme philosophical frontier: death and glory in Heidegger, Derrida, and Levinas. First, Robert Burch engages with Perniola’s discussion of death as conceived de-ontologically and in a culture of inﬁnite simulacral substitutions (La società dei simulacri, 1980). At issue is whether Perniola’s play of virtualities or Heidegger’s being-toward-death escapes the metaphysics of death. Second,

conviction that the spirit world was an integral part of the life force. In Af- rican traditions regarding the supernatural, the living and the dead are in- timately connected, this relationship often taking the form of ancestor wor- ship. For Africans, it is essential to be on good terms with ancestral spirits. In fact, deceased family members are considered part of the present family unit” (144). Ghosts raise the specter of black- white power relations, Smith- Wright argues, but also provide an opportunity for blacks to turn the tables on white power. Exploring the rich and highly contested tradition of ghostly folktales in West African culture and the Ameri can South, Smith- Wright asserts that, in the hands of such black women writers as Toni Morrison and Paule Mar- shall, ghosts are consequently used to “develop mythic explorations of ways for culturally disenfranchised Black…

some saw as the realisation of a prophecy. For South African literature in English had, after all, long since oriented itself towards just such a redemption of the sign, what- ever the duress – or duration – of the rupture of language that was an integral part of the repressive political culture surrounding it. The euphemisms of the apartheid State were a notorious component of its social engineering. Thus the forced removals of populations from their land or the imposition of coercive regimes of land use could be designated agri- cultural ‘betterment schemes’ on the part of white bureaucrats, or the ‘Natives (Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents) Act’ of 1952 could function in deﬁance of its apparent meaning to extend rather than to curtail the punitive reach of the Pass Laws. From the onset of National Party rule, South African literature in English unfolded within, and ag…

descriptor. In Hountondji’s words, positioning ‘African Philosophy’ as metaphysically particular constitutes ‘a metamorphisation of the ‘‘primitive mentality’’ into a ‘‘primitive philosophy’’ ’. By situating ‘African’ as a solely geographic descriptor, Hountondji seeks to pre- clude the simplistic way a thought still hostage to colonialist prejudice, even in a politically postcolonial age, might unify conceptions of the African intellect. Hountondji’s definition is consistent with the practice evident in the terms ‘German philosophy’, ‘French philosophy’, and so on. However, this geographic treatment proves wholly inadequate in capturing both important strains within the field as well as the historical exigencies that condition the pairing of ‘African’ and ‘philosophy.’ In his 1992 book In My Father’s House, Kwame Anthony Appiah writes that Hountondji’s geographic definition ‘knowingly s…

sacred substance, offers a means of desubjectification, and this is perhaps the aspect most relevant to Perlongher’s critical thinking: overcoming the objectifying rational and colonial categories of western thought and its phallic, anthropologic biases. The leaving of the self and escape from societal pressures are key to political action in the sense that they blast away the pillars upholding the capitalist system. His abandonment of the orgy in favour of transcendent ecstasy as a vehicle to escape the self was contemporary with (even slightly prior to) his illness. In 1989, at a research centre in Paris, where he spent nine months doing a PhD in sociology at the Sorbonne, he was diagnosed with AIDS. In 1987, he’d published the book O que é Aids? [The ghost of AIDS], which he later criticized as a work written from a healthy perspective. In it, he denounced the control of the body that AIDS in particular implied as a form of taming the nomadic sexual practices

of the characters as well as suffered by their author. In a closing autobiographical piece in The Foreign Legion, Lispector describes a strong, irrational response to the police shooting of the dangerous Brazilian out- law Mineirinho, who "had murdered far too often" (FL 213). He has infringed the commandment''Thou shalt not kill," yet to her dismay she cannot accept the justice of his death: That commandment is my greatest guarantee: so do not kill me, for I do not wish to die, and do not let me kill, for to have killed would cast me into eternal darkness. This is the commandment. But while I listen to the first and the second shot with a sense of relief and reassurance, the third shot makes me alert, the fourth leaves me anxious, the fifth and sixth cover me with shame, I hear the seventh and eighth while my heart beats with horror, at the ninth and tenth my mouth is trembling, at the …

graphic elements. In contrast to the torches on MacPherson’s sarcophagus, which were directed towards the ground indicating memento mori, the Beckers stela depicts a torch which points upwards, and accented by the wavy pattern of the torch’s fire; this is accompanied by the inscription ‘VOORLICHTING’ (meaning information, education, or counseling in Dutch), thus underscor­ ing the interpretation of the torch, not as a Christian symbol, but as a symbol of Enlightenment and social activism. The headstone’s main inscription con­ nects this iconographic element to biographical information: Beckers was a civil servant concerned with the protection of workers’ rights. Under the main inscription we find the wreath, with another inscription revealing that the stela was erected by the deceased’s friends. The latter is a regular ­feature of the socialist graves in Tongerseweg Cemetery, in…

CHAPTER ONE AFTER THE MEDIA: THE TEXTILITY OF CULTURAL TECHNIQUES BERNHARD SIEGERT 1. Media After Kittler Since Friedrich Kittler left this world in October 2011, numerous conferences and obituaries have been dedicated to the discussion of his legacy. The question of the past and the future of the so-called media is in this context of particular interest – especially with regard to the discipline of media studies, which is still developing, or already vanishing again. After Kittler, the meaning of media history as well as the necessity of media theory is on trial. The double meaning of after (in the Latin sense of either secundum or post) provides a useful framework for this revision. On the one hand, the question is what role after Kittler (in the sense of secundum or according to Kittler) media history and theory played in the humanities. Historical media studies, which emerged in the eighties of the

C O N C L U S I O N 81 In one segment of Ron Athey's 1994 performance Excerpts from Four Scenes in a Harsh Life (at Patrick's Cabaret in Minneapolis), Darryl Carlton lay with his back to Athey.35 Wearing surgical gloves and using a scalpel, Athey carved a pattern into his African American co-performer's back. Intermittently throughout the process, which was based on an African tribal scarification ritual, Athey placed a fresh paper towel over the incision he was making, slapped the towel, pressed on it to cause the blood from Carlton's back to seep through, and thereby created blood prints. Other perform- ers then hung the prints on a clothesline that stretched over the heads of the viewers.36 In another segment of the performance, Athey pierced his own arm with hypodermic needles (which did not cause bleeding) and inserted needles into his scalp (which did, but the blood was not used f…
