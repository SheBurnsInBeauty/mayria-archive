Luce Irigaray and the Nature of Sexual Difference 7 this philosophy is heterosexist, assuming that, being naturally different, men and women are naturally attracted to one another. Irigaray can- not, either, acknowledge deep differences between women but consid- ers them to differ only as particular members of a common kind. She therefore regards sexual difference as more fundamental than other dif- ferences, such as race. She also asserts that all individuals are naturally either male or female, implicitly denying – or dismissing as aberrant – the intersexed (those whose bodies have ambiguous sex characteristics, such as testes and a vagina). These problems all stem from Irigaray’s concep- tion of natural sexual difference, and so they cannot be resolved unless we fundamentally rethink her later philosophy. Nevertheless, given the attractions of this philosophy – its connection of femin…

the difference would lie in the shift from a speculum that reflects woman as secondary (male subject, female object) to one that reflects her as radi- cally other (two irreducibly different subjects). The “speculum mundi” of Irigaray’s own philosophical program is one that would reflect not one but two (transcendentally distinct) worlds. And it is one that would not depict

and thereby affirm traditional notions of feminity, but they also remain caught in the logic of the One/the Same underlying these traditional notions, which present them at best as equal and/or complementary to each other. Luce Irigaray, on the other hand, wants to escape this logic of the One/the Same by elaborating the idea that human being is not one but two, male and female, and that thinking this dual being means imaging, signifying, telling, valuing and elaborating this irrevocable, corporeal difference between the two as an irreducible difference in the symbolic, thus on the level of imagination and signification. This conclusion illuminates in turn the philosophical implications of this project. For as the order of discourse is constructed by means of the logic of the One/the Same, the act of replacing this order of the one by the two of sexual difference necessitates the re-imagination

principally the books Speculum (1985a) and This Sex Which Is Not One (1985b), is a sustained criticism of the unitary male perspective that she posits as dominating western philosophy and religion. The second phase, from the period of Sexes and Genealogies (1993b), proposes mediations, including cultural, legal and religious aspects, that would assist in redressing this imbalance. Irigaray’s final phase, which stretches from An Ethics of Sexual Difference (1993a) to The Way of Love (2002b), is devoted to establishing the philosophical and ethical contours for a new mode of relationship between women and men. Irigaray’s oeuvre thus commences with a critical assessment of western male philosophers and thinkers, ranging from Plato to Jacques Lacan, who have excluded women from their inner sanctum. In so far as they express any idea of the ‘feminine’, Irigaray understands this as a male projection. She is highly

specific bodies. Disembodying the female voice is seen as liberating in these films as it is primarily as a body, surveyed by the male gaze, that woman is constructed in classic cinematic narrative. According to Silverman, none has solidified the connections between the female voice and the body more than Irigaray. In This Sex Which is Not One (1977), Irigaray tries to describe the different economy of female desire in terms of the female form. Unlike the male organ, the female sex is not ‘one’ but several — with vulval lips that are always touching each other. Her vision of feminine language hangs on this model of multiplicity, contiguity, and simultaneity, valorizing the sense of touch over sight. Irigaray claims a woman speaks by wandering off in numerous directions, ‘touching upon’ rather than focusing, appearing mad or incoherent ‘from the standpoint of reason’ (cited i…

157 IRIGARAY AND DARWIN ON SEXUAL DIFFERENCE Some Reflections Elizabeth Grosz I want to begin with a bold conjecture: perhaps Luce Irigaray’s work on sexual difference might find unexpected confirmation from Charles Darwin’s account of sexual selection. Ironically, it may turn out that Irigaray finds the greatest philosophical confirmation of her claims regarding sexual dif- ference in Darwin’s understanding of the power and force of sexual selec- tion. Furthermore, we may find that Darwin’s work, with equal irony, can be interpreted not only as a systematic account of the forces that compose and transform natural existence, but as the first theoretical framework that makes the amorphous forces of sexual attraction and sexual differentiation productive of the richness and complexity of life. If Irigaray sees sexual dif- ference as the motor of cultural life, Darwin sees it as the motor of natural existence. Can Irigaray’s concept, which she clearly wrote with women’s

that writing must be bisexual (which recalls Woolf’s notion of androgyny): ‘There is no invention of other I’s, no poetry, no fiction without a certain homosexuality’ (Cixous 1981b:97). Luce Irigaray employs many elements of Lacanian psychoanalysis in her work. She describes women’s writing as parler femme: ‘her language in which “she” goes off in all directions and in which “he” is unable to discern the coherence of any meaning. Contradictory words seem a little crazy to the logic of reason, and inaudible for him who listens with ready-made grids, a code prepared in advance’ (Irigaray 1985:103). Again, we can see a recuperation of qualities which are attributed to women by men. She believes that women are able to use this type of language because, as she says, our sexual morphology is multiple and based on contiguity, in contrast to male sexuality which is unitary; thus she locates the …

performs an imaginative reading of This Sex Which Is Not One, in which Irigaray figures in the role of the (feminist) daughter of the father figures of psychoanalysis, Freud/Lacan. Likewise, in her review of Amante marine de Friedrich Nietzsche, Elizabeth L. Berg exclusively emphasizes the psycho­ analytic dimension of her work when she asserts that "[all] of Irigaray's work is in some sense to be understood as a dialogue with Lacan, although his name is spectacularly missing from her books".3 For the most part, the reception of lrigaray's work has been limited to the two texts that were first translated into English, namely Speculum of the Other Woman and This Sex Which Is Not One. Tori! Moi's Sexual/Textual Politics4 constitutes yet another comprehensive reading of lrigaray's work to date. However, even though she includes references to the entire body of Irigaray's writi…

In This Sex Which Is Not One, Luce Irigaray attacks psycho­ analysis for the reductive model it offers to women Psychoana­ lytic discourse on female sexuality is the discourse of truth A discourse which tells the truth about the logic of truth namely, that the feminine occurs only within models and laws devised by male subjects. Which implies that there are not really two sexes but only one "6 Linder the cover of pseudonyms, Stendhal, Sand, and Rachilde reevaluate this phallic model It is precisely because they do not share the values of patriarchal society that they reject the father's name For Freud, writes Irigaray, woman "remains forever fixated on the desire for the father, remains subject to the father and to his law, for fear of losing his love, which is the only thing capable of giving her any value at all Irigaray's revision of the Freudian paradigm repeats analytical…

Luce Irigaray as “a different relation to the transcendental.” For Irigaray, according to Simon Walter, the concept of specula- rization is an important figure in the nonacknowledgment of sexual difference. The constituted otherness of woman has been subsumed into a discourse of masculine sameness. The only representations of women possible within this economy are duplication, opposition, or insertion. The masculine has spoken the universal on behalf of woman by erasing her from discursive history. In Hegel and Heidegger, the relation of Being to non­ Being implicitly relegated woman to the position of nothingness in an ontological hierarchy; psychoanalysis, in its description of linguistic signification, makes this identification complete by excluding woman from the circulation of phallic meaning. The explicit sexualization of discourse is not simply a reactive deve­ lopment…

26 Luce Irigaray: Teaching lack or absence of male sexuate values (Freud, ‘Femininity’, in New Introductory Lectures in Psychoanalysis, pp. 145–69). This ‘economy of the same’, according to Irigaray, results in the existence of only one subject, the masculine subject (This Sex Which Is Not One, p. 74). While Irigaray’s early work critically responds to Freud’s theories on female sexuality (cf., for example, The Irigaray Reader), her more recent work focuses on outlining a path for constructing a culture of two subjects. In her proposed culture of two subjects, love cannot arouse a desire to possess the other or to make the other the same as oneself. The other is to be respected whether it exists internally or as an external subject. This conception of love is an integral part of my study of White’s work: it is her struggle with internal and external others and the struggle to establish the boundaries of her subjectivity that she narrates in her work.

and reciprocal exchanges between two subjects. This implies too that her thoughts on the fecundity of the love of the same other reaches further than the establishment of a hierarchical difference between same-sex love and hetero-sex love. It strikes at the heart of the fecundity of the communication among women and therefore at the heart of the idea that in this communication the divine can become manifest. As I showed in the previous paragraph, Luce Irigaray holds the opinion that the love between beloved lovers of the same sex will not produce this extase instante, this communion in pleasure which she calls 'a child prior to any child'. Although Luce Irigaray does not offer any arguments for this opinion, it can be traced to her view that 'woman becomes she who can unite within her the maternal-feminine and the filial.' This view implies that woman always has the maternal-feminine under her skin and that when she loves another woman she

nor sexually distinct; it is in/between existence. Rather than chiasm being sexually indistinct Irigaray pursues the argument that an unspoken fixture of sexual difference subsisting in flesh belies the notion of ontological difference. For Irigaray the dividedness of existence cannot be read reflexively in the case of woman, since there is no property of woman in existence. Instead Irigaray maintains that each being of woman is a materialization that differs in relation with itself such that no gathering of the difference is possible: So, when she touches herself (again), who is ‘she?’ And ‘herself?’ Inseparable, ‘she’ and ‘herself’ are part the one of the other, endlessly. They cannot really be distinguished, they are not for all that the female same, nor the male same. That can be reassembled within some whole. This is to say again, or further, that it would be impossible to decide …

Philosopher, psychoanalyst and linguist, Luce Irigaray is not easy to categorise. Born in Belgium in 1930, she first studied literature, focusing on Paul Valéry, during her early training at Louvain. She completed her Doctorate of Letters at the University of Paris VIII, and has lived in France since that time. Her thesis, which focused on figures such as Plato, Freud and Hegel, was published in 1974 as Speculum of the Other Woman. In 1977, a collection of articles and interviews, This Sex Which Is Not One, appeared. English translations of both books were published in 1985, and since that time (although some works still remain to be translated), her work has been translated more promptly. An Ethics of Sexual Difference (1984) …

psychoanalysis. (Irigaray is a Director of Research at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, where she established an international team to work on linguistic patterns in relation to gender, the focus of her most recent work.) Irigaray has divided her work into three periods. The first stage includes Speculum of the Other Woman (1974) and This Sex Which Is Not One (1977) and criticises the monism and univocity of the traditionally male dominated canonical corpus of Western philosophy. In the second stage, which includes Sexes and Genealogies (1987), rather than criticising the tradition, she turned her attention to the positive project of creating an alternative to the tradition in the form of a feminine voice. This more creative and inventive phase of her work, in which women's points of view were more adequately represented was followed by a third phase, represented by Je, …

of woman, Irigaray opposes an ‘other woman’, a woman ‘with¬ out common measure’ who cannot be reduced to the quantifying measurements by which she is domesticated in male systems, who exceeds attempts to pin her down and confine her within a theoretical system, whose volume is ‘incontournable’, whose lips touch without distinction of one and two (on this see ‘The limits of the trans¬ ference’ in section II below). Against the Lacanian image of woman as hole, Irigaray opposes the image of contiguity, of the two lips touching, which elsewhere in Speculum stands for the contiguity of mother and daughter, or the contiguity of intercourse between mother and father, maternal and paternal genealogies, and the possi¬ bility that woman’s desire could be represented for-itself, other than as it appears in male representations - a possibility which she de¬ scribes variously as a volume no longer thought of as a closed or

given mode of difference onto other forms of diversity that operate and are repressed in different ways. For Irigaray, symbolic patterns of representation deny the relevance of sexual difference to how human subjects relate to issues surrounding corporeality and (re-) production. She claims that phallocentrism has a vested interest in subverting difference and denying its existence insofar as it maintains a logic that is rooted in an a priori of the same. Subjectivity and meaning are affected by this denial of difference which accounts for the hierarchical nature of many social relations. For Irigaray, woman is specularized and commodified by symbolic patterns of discourse and representation. Specula(riza)tion Irigaray’s notion of ‘specula(riza)tion’ is founded on her belief that the feminine has been trapped within a mirroring function within phallo- centrism. Women have come…

VI. Luce Irigaray (1932–) Luce Irigaray is especially critical of Freud’s view of women.In Spéculum de l’autre femme (1974) she argues that Freud’s ‘penis envy’ envisages women as not really existing at all independently but only as negative mirror images of men. Male perception is clearly associated with sight (observation, analysis, aesthetics etc), but women gain pleasure from physical contact.The eroticism of women is fundamentally different to that of men.For Irigaray,all this implies that women should celebrate their completely different nature to men, their otherness. Only in this way can they overcome the traditional male-dominated perception of women. VII. Ruth Robbins The general concern of Marxist Feminism is to reveal the double oppression of women,both by the capitalist system and by sexuality within the home, and to explain the rela- tionships between the two. The ideas of …

als, without distinction of sex. Let me enlighten you with an abridged version of that shady affair: even though she is homo, since she is not vir, femina has no soul. Which would mean that the soul is virile, whereas we know, thanks to Freud, Jung, and a few others, who came well after the council of Mâcon, I’ll grant you that, that there are (at least) two souls, hence a psychic bisexuality. I will refrain from criticiz- the feminine and the sacred 63

not just to biological sexuality but to the male and female sexual organs. Le genre refers to the human race as well as to grammatical gender. Irigaray has thus far been extremely circumspect in her use of le sexe, making sure that it is not simply associated with genitality. In a rare footnote in Sexes and Genealogies, Irigaray now consolidates her usage of these two terms. She states ‘The word sex is used in regard to male and female persons and not only to male and female genital organs’ (1993b: 128). Previously, in relation to the emblem of ‘two lips’, Irigaray had also specified that: ‘the/a woman who doesn’t have one sex organ, or a unified sexuality ... cannot subsume it/herself under one generic or specific term [i.e., male gender]’ (1985a: 233). In connection with the biological sex, Irigaray expands on her notion of a new morphology for women beyond the maternal: ‘The issue is to to learn to discover a different kind of magnetism and the morphology of a

This post-millennial development is a startling departure from the traditional view of masculinity as the seat of reason and femininity as the body. Luce Irigaray has influentially demonstrated the ways in which this dichotomy has underpinned the Western tradition.12 To parse Irigaray’s larg- er argument in Speculum of the Other Woman, great male minds, desiring to see their own reflection, attempt to reproduce their own stature through philosophical discourse, which puts them in contact with other great male minds, a culture of narcissism entirely situated within male homosocial relations. This fantasy of masculine autogenesis, a shared male world of spiritualized male desire and male beauty, is what Luce Irigaray critiques as hommosexuality, her neologism. As a result, women function as flawed copies of men, useful mirrors that reflect male glory. Women are reified as maternal and reproductive (the primary social roles of the mother and

If sexual difference is an ontological force, one vigorously at work in the generation of most forms of life on Earth, and one that is particularly pro- ductive of more and more other forms difference or variation,1 it is irreduc- ible, and at present irreplaceable, as the processes by which life is created and regenerated. There may be more than two sexes,2 but life’s prolifera- tion of variation requires at least two, for the increasing intensification of living differences occurs primarily through sexual difference, however this is conceived, and depending on which species one focuses on. Luce Iriga- ray is, of course, the preeminent philosopher of sexual difference; it has occupied her writings for close to sixty years and over thirty books, and no one has come closer to the intricate understanding of the operations of phal-

Only a few scholars, like Margaret Whitford, 5 Elizabeth Grosz,6 and Naomi Schor,7 have attempted to tackle her complete work. Among these, the work of Margaret Whitford stands out in its rigorous treatment of Irigaray's text from a philosophical, as well as a psychoanalytic, perspective. Whitford argues in her assessment of lrigaray for "the psychoanalytic dimension of lriga­ ray's work to be taken seriously".8 But in Whitford's groundbreak­ ing work, Luce Jrigaray: Philosophy in the Feminine, a lucid and engaging reading of Irigaray's whole corpus, Whitford also argues for the necessity to treat Irigaray as a philosophical thinker. In addition, with the publication of The lrigaray Reader, Whitford introduces the Anglo-American reader to a broad specter of lriga­

The Power of Discourse and the Subordination of the Feminine Luce Irigaray French philosopher Luce Irigaray published two highly influential books in the 1970s - Specu- lum of the Other Woman (1975) and This Sex Which Is Not One (1977). The first was a meditation on the history of Western philosophy from the perspective of women. The second was a more polemical feminist text that advanced the ideas of separatism, the idea that women should withdraw from patriarchy entirely and constitute an alternative arena of their own. In this selection, Irigaray discusses the male philosophic tradition as one founded on a speculative separation from matter. What she calls "the feminine" - everything having to do with matter and the contact between material planes - has to be subordinated to a masculine idealizing tendency that uses the feminine as a mirror for its own narcissistic speculations. Unless we limit ourselves naively - or perhaps strategically - to some kind of limited or

luce irigaraY: an ode to a-(luce) 301 Irigaray’s later work insists that it is the law that has an important role to play in reimagining the civic subject who is not sexually neutral. Her proposal for sexuate rights is the most explicit exposition of this thesis. Irigaray proposes, in the style of a legal code, a number of specific demands to be made of law with the aim of establishing a civil identity for women (Irigaray 1993b: 86–9, 1994: 60–2, 1996: 132). These can be ordered loosely into four general categories. The first of these include the right to human identity, which Irigaray describes as a right to ‘virginity’,4 and also the right to dignity: Our need first and foremost is for a right to human dignity for everyone. That means we need laws that valorise difference. Not all subjects are the same, nor equal, and it wouldn’t be right for them to be so. That’s particularly true for the sexes. Therefore, it’s important to understand

luce irigaray 353 found in sexual diff erence. Why there? Because it is there that two subjects exist who must not be situated in a hierarchical or gene- alogical relation, and because these two subjects have the task of preserving the human species and of developing its culture through respecting their diff erences.28 vii. irigaray and levinas Irigaray’s thought on those diff erences is deeply marked by Levinas’s ethics of alterity,29 his critique of Western philosophy’s traditional ranking of ontology over ethics, and his philosophical approach to the question of the divine. As explicated in Totality and Infi nity, Levinas’s notion of the Other “as irreduc- ibly and infi nitely other” implies that alterity cannot be understood according to the categories of traditional Western ontology. A complete description of the relation of self and other would do violence to the alterity o…

makes him different from Clarice Lispector, who does not move from the wound. But little by little, this difference is erased. If one takes a distance, one begins to see the world emerge in an analogous fashion. Genet or Lispector cherishes a world that for us, for them, is tenderly and violently other. In A Bela e a Fera (Beauty and the Beast), for example, there was the sudden apparition of the one- legged beggar. In Clarice, the chain of the other, the violently other, contains a terrifying beggar as well as a brigand, and the psychotic child as well as the cock- roach. It is a universe quite removed from the human sphere. This problematic world can also be found in Genet with differences, for example, in the choice of those who represent otherness. In Genet the others are often the Arabs. I allude to the blind Arab who has his white cane to protect himself from the violence of

scholarship. However, his concept of radical heteronomy has significantly influenced Luce Irigaray in her formulation of an ethics of sexual difference.3 Although, like de Beauvoir, Irigaray is critical of Levinas’s theorizing of the feminine, her interpretation of his ethics is more attentive to the contradictions which beset his attempt to subordinate sexual difference to his account of ethical difference. As will be discussed in the following chapters, Irigaray’s reading of Levinas’s conceptualization of alterity is turned to a reconsideration of sexual difference as the threshold of ethics. It is also possible to draw from this reading an investment in light as a medium of feminine incarnation.

FEMINIST PHILOSOPHIES A–Z 99 Luce Irigarary in This Sex Which Is Not One (1985a) also emphasises the importance of pluralism, taking this pluralism to be embodied and through embodiment con- nected to theory and practice. Irigaray suggests that women can create their own feminine sexuality, one that is plural, modelled on their own sexual organs, the labia that are already two and maybe more, and their own or- gasms as multiple. She states ‘[h]er sexuality is at least double, goes even further; it is plural’ (1985a: 32). Just as the phallocentric order translates from sexuality through to language and theory, so does female sexuality. Femi- nine theory, language, and social order will thus be mul- tiple and pluralistic. Criticisms and insights from all branches of feminist philosophy and from numerous thinkers, including Lu- gones, Harding, Haraway and Luce Irigaray, have made clear the importance of pluralism in feminist theory and practice.

Let me leave Barthes and Cixous for a moment to briefly consider a different theoretical model. In her famous reading of Freud’s lectures on femininity in Speculum de l’autre femme [Speculum of the Other Woman], Luce Irigaray insists on the impossibility of female masturbation within the Freudian psychoanalytic model.7 Clearly more knowledgeable about the physiology of female pleasure than either Freud or Barthes, Irigaray hones in on the role of the clitoris for female self-stimulation. Of course, Irigaray hastens to add, it is hard to understand why we should limit ourselves to the clitoris alone, just as it is equally hard to accept Freud’s insistence that the clitoris be ‘‘given up’’ in favor of the vagina precisely at the moment femininity is ‘‘formed.’’ Clitoris and vagina can never be substituted one for the other, Irigaray insists, and both play a role in woman’s ‘‘jouissance.’’ …

which is posited as fundamentally incommensurable with the masculine economy of the same. As a relation between incommensurables, the positivity of eros would be accomplished in this 'negativity'. The absence of the feminine other in eros is precisely the presence of the other as other, and could only be construed as a failure were it to be judged according to the aims of another project: possession, knowledge, seizure. In other words, the 'failure' of the (masculine) subject to 'account for' the feminine constitutes the positivity of sexual difference, or the positivity of the feminine as absolutely other.24 However, despite the fact that these feminist defences of Levinas can be articulated in an 'Irigarayan' language, they bear an only tangential relation to Irigaray's actual views on Levinas. In 'The Fecundity of the Caress', Irigaray reads Levinas's phenomenology of eros as suggestive of various possibilities

order to accommodate the enigmatic stimuli arising from the other. Yet neither is asked to compromise on his or her singularity. Each is allowed to cultivate his or her distinctiveness even as they increas- ingly grow into each other. Indeed, if one face of transcendence is to reach beyond the self’s current state toward an unfamiliar way of being, then the fact that we interact with loved ones who always to some degree remain unknowable to us increases our aptitude for it by compelling us to assimilate emotional energies that are foreign to us. From this perspective, the other’s unknowability is less a threat to be subdued than a fount of existential potentiality to be revered. Luce Irigaray expresses the matter perfectly when she proposes that it is only insofar as we respect the inviolable mystery of the other—that we admit that the other is irreducibly different from us—th…

Luce Irigaray and sexual difference question for which these are ‘answers’, ‘where is female sexuality to be located?’, already posits women in male terms. Indeed, that it is a question of speculation, debate and controversy at all signifies the degree of mystification surrounding female pleasure considered in its own terms. The question implies an answer specifying one place, one pleasure and one sexual organ between which women (and male experts) are to choose. Whatever alter- native is chosen, the other term is relegated to the position of ‘secondary’ sexual organ, part of ‘foreplay’, preliminary to ‘real’ sexual, that is, genital, copulative relations (a phallocentric notion if ever there were one! ). If Irigaray’s concept of female pleasure is based on Freud’s account of pre-oedipal polymorphous sexuality, she diverges from his presumption that it is a masculine phase…

that it is not recognised as a sex independent of men: Female sexuality has always been conceptualised on the basis of mascu- line parameters . . . women’s erogenous zones never amount to anything but a clitoris-sex that is not comparable to the noble phallic organ, or a hole- envelope that serves to sheathe and massage the penis in intercourse: a non- sex, or a masculine organ turned back upon itself . . . (Irigaray 1985a: 23) The title This Sex Which Is Not One implies, however, a further meaning: not just that she is not a (recognised) sex but, in addition, that her sex (organs) cannot be limited to one. Human sexuality is oriented around the one sexual organ of the male – the penis – and women’s sexual organs are seen as either a diminutive copy of, or as a sheath for, the male sexual organ. But Irigaray seeks to rewrite women’s sexuality speculating that we could understand or inter…

Since Irigaray emphasises the importance of early infantile relationships to the mother, her later perspective remains broadly psychoanalytic, but some feminists may be unhappy about her shift away from the Lacanian insistencethatsexedidentities can neverbecompletelyorstablyachieved. I shall not directly address this issue in this book because it can be satisfac- torily resolved only once Irigaray’s later philosophical approach is thor- oughly understood. However, inasmuch as I criticise her exclusive belief in natural duality and attempt to show that sexual difference invariably co-exists with – and becomes disturbed by – multiple bodily drives, I hope, at least, to open up a perspective from which we can rethink Irigaray’s later ideas consistently with a more Lacania…

14 Seyla Benhabib also describes Hegel’s “rational ontology of gender” according to these opposing principles (1991, 129-45). Luce Irigaray’s analysis of this ontology, and woman’s corresponding “eternal irony”, extends to Hegel’s description of the physical differences between men and women. In The Philosophy of Nature, he figures women’s sexual organs as the literal negative of the male organs, lacking the capacity to “emerge into opposition” to “become and independent and active cerebrality” (Hegel, 1970, 173). The female thus constitutes merely “the principle of conception”. As Irigaray remarks, “What an amazing vicious circle in a single syllogistic system.” (1985a, 223).

luce irigaray 349 sexual diff erence. Boys have a much more diffi cult problem to solve than have girls, given that boys cannot rely on the resemblance of generational mode to mitigate their existential dependence on a being of another sex. Irigaray alleges that the cultural achievements of male monocultures are failed and deluded strategies for resolving this puzzle. Eff orts to enclose women in defi nitions that eff ectively create them as castrated beings, of inferior cogni- tive, creative, conceptual, logical, or rational faculties, are compensatory proj- ects of sexuate ressentiment. Law and custom that restrict women to a domestic or private realm, or permit their circulation only as commodities, likewise seek reactively to enclose in reprisal the sex in whom all initially were held in body. As with Freud, Irigaray takes Lacan at his word, considering that he expresses accu…

sopher’s wife (or sister, or mother in some cases). The sexual imagery is quite deliberate; she has in mind a kind of ‘amorous exchange’ in which sexual difference would be enacted in language, and she attempts to suggest this textually, to a certain extent, by mingling her own voice with the voice/text of the philosopher. This can be seen in its purest, unmixed form, in Speculum, where one of the sections (‘Une Mere de glace’), consists entirely of extracts from Plotinus, judiciously selected. (Irigaray is here only present in the selection of extracts.) Irigaray states specifically at the end of Speculum that: Precise references in the form of notes or punctuation indi¬ cating quotation have often been omitted. Because in relation to

Luce Irigaray's Language of Essence I 61 submersion: "no event makes us women," she explains, rather "by our lips we are women" {This Sex, 211, 209-10). Unlike Wittig, who severs thé classification "woman" from any anatomical determinants, there can be little doubt that, for Irigaray, a woman is classified as such on the basis of anatomy: Your/my body doesn't acquire its sex through an operation. Through the action of some power, function, or organ. Without any interven- tion or special manipulation, you are a woman already. (This Sex, 211) The point, for Irigaray, of defining women from an essentialist stand- point is not to imprison women within their bodies but to rescue them from enculturating definitions by men. An essentialist definition of "woman" implies that there will always remain some part of "woman" which resists masculine imprinting and socialization: How can I say it? That we are women from the start. That we don't

men for the realization of their potential.6 The whole point of her work is to show that virtually from the beginning of (patriarchal) Western culture women's nature has been construed to be a derivative or subsidiary form of masculine characteristics. There is 'no parity between the sexes. Because male sexuality is taken as the standard, for example, women are not even regarded as a sex because they "lack" a visible, single sex organ. Hence, women are "this sex which is not one" —the title of a book she first published in 1977. (Actually, the title is deliberately ambiguous; she also means that women's sexuality is much more diverse and multiple than men's—i.e., not "one.") True mutuality between the sexes is thus impossible, argues Irigaray, because all of our habits and even language itself characterizes women primarily in the distorted image of masculine values. Modern feminism, even though it has had some limited

tolerated, apparently, were his own.3 The following year Irigaray published an essay in which she responded directly to the theories of femininity and sexual difference in Encore. In “Così fan tutti” (reprinted in This Sex Which Is Not One), Irigaray makes explicit and accentuates her divergences from Lacan. Whereas in Speculum she concedes that both women and men can go to the place of mystical jouissance, at least within the terms of a still phallogocentric order, in “Così fan tutti” Irigaray insists on the links between the kind of body that one has and one’s ability to speak “from the other side.” This move makes explicit what was implied in Speculum—in the mystic’s writings an imaginary grounded in the form of the female body emerges, one that can serve as the support for feminine subjectivity just as the phallus has upheld the illusion of a whole, unfragmented subjectivity for men.…

male standard; that is, sexual différance beyond relational difference amounting to equivalence - one that disrupts what Irigaray coined hommosexualité.50 Actual sexual difference is veiled as the castrated woman who, in turn, is veiled as phallic; thus, non-binary sexual difference is twice removed. Does this doubly veiled woman ultimately divest her ghastly cerements? But here at the climax of the tale - meant to afford a final anagnorisis - the tale abruptly yet appropriately ceases, seeing that sexual différance can only remain unrepresentable in a signifying system that privileges the signifier of the phallus. In Irigaray’s Spéculum de l’autre femme [Speculum of the other woman], she argues how the specular logic of the “self-same” underlying Western philosophical discourse is, in the words of Toril Moi, …incapable of representing femininity/woman other than as the negative of its own reflection … The thinking man

55. Irigaray, Ce sexe qui n’en est pas un, 145; Th is Sex Which Is Not One, 149. 56. Irigaray describes the mimetic practice in the following way: “Th ere is, in an initial phase, perhaps only one ‘path,’ the one historically assigned to the feminine: that of mimicry. One must assume the feminine role deliberately. Which means already to convert a form of subor- dination into an affi rmation, and thus to begin to thwart it” (Th is Sex Which Is Not One, 76; Ce sexe qui n’en est pas un 73–4).

understood in terms of this singular origin. If the univocal identity of geni- tal sexuality is articulated as the identity of the phallus, and if the phallus functions as the origin and essence of sexuality as such, then a nonphallic sexuality, “feminine” sexuality, can be represented only within the param- eters of resemblance or analogy with phallic identity.26 And, indeed, this is precisely what Irigaray demonstrates. Freud represents “feminine” sexuality in terms of its resemblance and analogy with the identity of the phallus and “masculine” sexuality: the clitoris is like a penis, the little girl’s stimulation of her clitoris is like the little boy’s stimulation of his penis, and in this sense, the little girl is like a little boy. Moreover, when Freud points to a breakdown of resemblance (e.g., in his account the significance of castra- tion anxiety for “feminine” psychosexual development), the aim and object

I question the wisdom of locating female powererotic, mystic, intuitivein an organ that reads differently according to its owner's or former owner's age. Luce Irigaray's "Ce Sexe qui n'en est pas un," as title, pun, and article, poeticizes and analyzes female pleasure as multiple, a polyvocality of organs, surfaces, sensations, and as inclusive of differences among women. I gather from Irigaray's arguments and ecstasies that any and all female bodies are erotic. Patriarchy, then, is arbitrary in its eroticization of the firm(er) phallic body, the vagina that is the corresponding nothing to man's something, the womb that is his dream of himself, and in so doing more severely castrates the old(er) woman than the young(er). Arbitrariness is historically specific, so if Cranach's, Rubens's, Titian's, Renoir's, Boucher's, and Modigliani'…

That amounts to joying in the truth of self­ division (abjection/sacred). Here two paths open out: subli­ mation and perversion. And their intersection: religion. Freud did not need to go to Colonus for that. He had Moses, who preceded him in this reversal of defilement in subjection to symbolic law. But it may be that Oedipus at Colonus shows, in addition to other modifications of Greek culture, the path by which Hellenism could meet with the Bible. ,~ ~ t~ ;:-t\'1 " \\')~ii...\

Luce Irigaray's Language of Essence I 59 tion, property (propriété), order, form, unity, visibility, erection" (1985, 77). The features associated with a female imaginary, as we might expect, more closely approximate the properties of liquids: "con- tinuous, compressible, dilatable, viscous, conductible, diffusable" {This Sex, 111). The problem here is simply that many of the properties Irigaray associates with the two lips might also describe the penis. As K.K. Ruthven points out: A good deal depends here on the accuracy of Irigaray's characteriza- tion of the penis as "one" in comparison with the "not one" of the vulva. Certainly, her theory seems to require the penis to be always inflexibly erect and quite without metamorphic variation, and also to be circumcised, as the presence of a foreskin endows it with most of the properties she attributes to the labia.

22 Luce Irigaray: Teaching Most memorable to me was the afternoon when Luce Irigaray described the relation between virginity and the sacred syllable om. This resonant sound is sometimes uttered at the beginning of a yoga or meditation practice in order to collectively reach an intentional union with the divine. When uttered, the sound om gradually moves the lips from an open to a closed position. Their closing in this instance signifies that which remains interior, mysterious, ‘and not yet manifested’ (Sexes and Genealogies, pp. 100–1), that which somehow would correspond to an ‘indeterminate absolute that determines us none- theless’ (‘Spiritual Tasks for Our Age’, in Key Writings, p. 172). In the case of female sexuality, we could recall women’s two sets of contiguous lips, and also relate this linguistic pronunciation om to a genital real. Such a parallel allows us to imagine Daphne’s ‘just not yet’ as an intentional preservation of a divine

nario in which a sexually differentiated being has no relationship whatso- ever to a generational negativity, although one might imagine a sexuate being arising from nonsexuate causes and engendering no future genera- tions of its own. Whether such a being would be meaningfully sexuate is another question, one challenge being under what conditions such a being would belong to a kind whose reference is fixed to a structure of genera- tional reproduction, including if we imagine this being as the only individ- ual or sex ever of its kind or in relation to another sex coexisting with it or arising at an entirely different time in the same way. We may leave this ques- tion open for further scrutiny. It does not escape me that these thought experiments are far removed from life as we know it. For good reason, Irigaray’s work, phenomenologi- cally invested in how life does appear, does not seriously entertain such sce-

the same time, relying on appearance alone could be misleading. As one expert pointed out, an underdeveloped penis combined with undescended testicles and a rudimentary vagina “simulates the presence of a vulva; hypertrophy of the clitoris simulates hypospadias of a penis; labial ectopia [displacement], the testicles; adherence of the labia majora, the scrotum; [and] non-adherent labia, a divided scrotum.””’ Because of such “simula- tions,” according to Dreger, medical professionals were forced to look to a preponderance of the evidence. All aspects of a person’s body considered, did the person betray evidence of being male or evidence of being female? In making these determinations, it bears remarking that doctors seem to have included both characteristics we might continue to find relevant to a determination of sex—namely, “hair, beard, breasts and the development of the hips”—as well as evidence we might more likely impute to gender—

characteristic between humans. The corporeal mapping of race and sex is never simple, and feminists need to ask more complex questions about the inter­ relationship of those categories and the body. It is no surprise, then, that the devaluation of women through their putative identification with bodily matters is mirrored by a similarly grounded devalua­ tion of slaves, of children, of animals, and of black people. Work in both philosophy and science studies, as the pieces by Elizabeth Spelman and Lynda Birke show, outlines a move to reduce marginalised others to their bodies. The process of categorisation that works to set in place boundaries between the normal and the abnormal, between the fully human and the sub-human, is as pertinent to the classical institution of slavery as it is to more recent biological reductionism that ties women to their reproductive functions. As Spelman eloquently points out, one heritage of the Platonic distinction between bodies

purview of her written work; I, for example, was familiar only with Speculum and This Sex Which Is Not One. Prior to and during our meetings, Luce prevailed upon us to read her work more broadly, explaining that we came dangerously close to misrepresenting her if we did not do so. In May, I intellectually under- stood and agreed with her point. Six months later, I have had the pleasure of more fully engaging with the texts discussed in this essay and, although I remain committed to and profoundly moved by the crystalline fury of her first two seminal texts, I can say with certainty that they do not adequately represent the full theoretical importance of Luce Irigaray. I chose to examine the concept of virginity for this essay because it best illumi- nates the progression in my own thinking since my trip to Nottingham. Virginity was on my mind during my fieldwork at the vulvar clinic, since all of the patients

Alongside the return of the repressed of human exceptionalism and the acceptance that we are now different after all, we might also need to confront a new form of indifference. We might need to think beyond the nonnegotiable terrain of sexual difference, where all life emerges from relations and encounters between tendencies. One thing is certain: if there had not been sexual difference in its narrowest sense (man and woman), there could not have been the nuclear family, divi- sion of labor, and then industrialism. At the same time, if there had not been industrialism, at least in our world history, women would not have been liberated from domestic labor and granted access to the forms of planet-­exploitative luxu…

It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention’ (157). Holmes here is a committed media historian. This story is then a poor piece of evidence in the case that Kittler would like to construct about the machinic anonymity of the typewriter. It rests upon the opposite claim that Kit- tler makes, namely that no two typewriters are the same.

In this way, The Argonauts tells a careful story about networks of queer and non-binary relationships in a North American political climate where the viability of such relationships is constantly called into question. The female body is capacious throughout The Argonauts. The vagina is capacious because it can accommodate the baby’s head (“it feels big but I feel big enough”) and because fisting leaves the author feeling “invincible and ample”.28 When the couple watch the queer art-porn film Community Action Centre, Harry is left perplexed with the absence of cock: “the cat- egory of women should be capacious enough to include it”.29 Perhaps most importantly, Nelson explores the capaciousness of her own pregnant

In a 2016 interview with The New York Times, Myles says, ‘I’ve known Maggie Nelson for 20 years. That’s totally what the poetry world is, is those kind of relationships’ (Correal 2016). This seems to suggest that the poetry world of Nelson and Myles is not that dissimilar to the groups of artists and writers with whom Stein and O’Hara interacted. As my previous paragraph demonstrates, Nelson has critical investments in the New York School that range beyond her creative practice. Investigating the poetics, style and postures of the New York School, Nelson traces influence as far back as Stein, before turning to O’Hara, ultimately considering Mayer, Notley and Myles.
