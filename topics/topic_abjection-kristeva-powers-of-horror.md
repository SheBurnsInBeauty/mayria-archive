Horror. For Kristeva, the abject is something that evokes feelings of sheer dis- gust, fear or repulsion from the viewer or reader. Classic examples of the abject include the sight of a human corpse, an open wound, faeces, or bodily flu- ids. Such objects derive their power of abjection due to a breakdown in the chain of signification through which meaning is produced. The abject is best defined in terms of what it is not—it is neither subject nor object and it can’t be accommodated within the symbolic order of meaning. Kristeva conceptu- alises it in the following words, “There looms, within abjection, one of those

Julia Kristeva’s book The Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection posits a def- inition of the abject in terms that are particularly relevant to discussions about hor- ror art. Kristeva views the abject as terrifying because it threatens to disrupt our conventional understanding of “borders, positions, rules” (4). The horror monster signifies abject terror because it violates cultural categories, disrespects organizing principles, and generally serves to present a chaotic alternative to the place of order and meaning, socially as well as biologically. The abject is what is set in motion by the monster, the terror that his disruptive actions inspire. When Creed applies Kristeva’s range of psychoanalytical formulations specifically to the physical bod- ies of women in horror films, she discovers that the monstrous feminine is centered within a woman’s reproductive and mothering functions w…

1 KRISTEVA, FEMININITY, ABJECTION We may call it a border; abjection is above all ambiguity. Because, while releasing a hold, it does not radically cut off the subject from what threatens it - on the contrary, abjection acknowledges it to be in perpetual danger. Julia Kristeva, Powers of Horror Julia Kristeva's Powers of Horror provides us with a preliminary hypothesis for an analysis of the representation of woman as monstrous in the horror film. Although her study is concerned with psychoanalysis and literature, it nevertheless suggests a way of situating the monstrous-feminine in the horror film in relation to the maternal figure and what Kristeva terms 'abjection', that which does not 'respect borders, positions, rules', that which 'disturbs identity, system, order' (Kristeva, 1982, 4). In general terms, Kristeva is attempting to explore the different ways in which abj…

THE MONSTROUS-FEMININE function as both source of life and abyss. In both aspects she is constructed as abject to ensure the constitution of subjectivity and the law. Kristeva draws attention to the phantasmatic power of the archaic mother and to the power of the mother in general whether 'historical or phantasmatic, natu- ral or reproductive' (Kristeva, 1982, 91). She is specifically interested in how the processes of abjection are used to subordinate maternal power to symbolic law. Her central interest, however, lies with the mother of the pre-symbolic. Nevertheless, we can draw on her theory of abjection to analyse the way in which the phantasized figure of the archaic mother - particularly in relation to birth and death - is constructed as an abject within the signifying practices of the horror film. The maternal figure constructed within/by the writings of Freud and Lacan…

stressing the important turn involved in the theory of abjection. Abjection is, for Kristeva, an experience of unmatched primordial hor- ror, putting the subject in the most devastating kind of crisis imagina- ble; but ultimately, certain modes of discourse have found a way of speaking that horror instead of repressing it. Literature, she proposes, offers this possibility in an exemplary way, and may serve as abjection’s “privileged signifier” (Powers of Horror, p. 208). The test of that pro- posal will follow in the subsequent chapters of the book, where we will read Kristeva reading literature in order, responsibly, to read literature by way of her.

concepts and psychic processes. In Powers of Horror (1982), she analyzes the concept of “abjection” and “horror,” incorporating in these terms her earlier focus on “negativity” and rejet. “Abjection” is described as “what disturbs identity, system, order”; the “abject” can be ex- empliﬁed by those “unclean” and “improper” aspects of corporeality and instinctual life which are disavowed in order for the subject to enter into the “symbolic order.” Drawing on Freud’s cultural criticism, particularly Totem and Taboo and Civilization and Its Discontents, and Mary Douglas’s Purity and Danger, Kristeva’s “anthropological” focus is also on the ways in which societies and religions have

and Reformation Traditions, 2 vols. (Leiden: Brill, 2011). 23 Julia Kristeva, in Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985), describes the corpse as a polluting factor from which the individual needs protection. In these images, the viewer does not need protection; the corpse is a powerfully attractive object that initiates various imaginative routes.

function of art. Kristeva thus begins to sketch out the political significance of the avant-garde, and at the same time offers insights into the way psychoanalytic theory can throw light on social relations. Poetry becomes, in Kristeva's analysis, a way of maintaining social bonds through what is destructive of the social, and conducive to madness. Poetry is capitalist society's carnival, a way of keeping death and madness at bay. Poetry is a refusal of a 'flight into madness'.16 Finally, Kristeva's work has focused even more closely on psychoanalytic theory during the 1980s. Powers of Horror17 marks a turning point in this regard for at least two reasons. Firstly, while psychoanalysis and semiotics remain the principal instruments of explication, there is in this text a strong sense that the origin of psychoanalysis itself might be brought into the picture, via the notion …

1982, 4). In general terms, Kristeva is attempting to explore the different ways in which abjection works within human societies, as a means of separating out the human from the nonhuman and the fully constituted subject from the partially formed subject. Ritual becomes a means by which societies both renew their initial contact with the abject element and then exclude that element. Through ritual, the demarcation lines between the human and nonhuman are drawn up anew and presumably made all the stronger for that process. (One of Kristeva’s aims in Powers of Horror is to present a rewriting of many of the ideas and beliefs put forward by the College of Sociology, specifically those associated with the nature of femininity, abjection and the sacred. For an introduction to the philosophy and writings of the college see The College of Sociology (1937–​39) edited by Denis Hollier.…

Hatoum, and Jana Sterbak embody a language that ‘attempts to come as close as possible, almost to accompany [the] state of abjection, [the] permanent oscillation between subject and object’ (pp. 22–23). This lends the works a cathartic value. Artworks, in Kristeva’s terms, are not passive objects of contemplation. They rouse those who encounter them and act upon them. Kristeva’s emphasis on avant-garde art and literature as media in which sanctioned transgressions of notions of purity are made possible seems to render catharsis through cultural forms the reserve of a relatively small audience. Creed counters this tendency, providing a compelling demonstration of how Kristeva’s ideas about abjection can also be illu- minating in the context of popular culture. In The Monstrous-Feminine, she demonstrates how media such as the horror film also potentially have a therapeutic role.7 For Creed (1986, p. 53), the horror film can

–––– (1980) Pouvoirs de l’horreur. Paris: Éditions du Seuil. (English version, 1982, Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection, trans. Leon S. Roudiez, New York: Columbia University Press.) After nearly a decade of writing very dense and abstruse academese, Kristeva began writing in a new, more poetic and open style. This was her ﬁrst book-length excursion into this kind of writing – and it makes for a very good read. The subject matter of the book is the process of abjection, the process by which a child who is still in the imaginary realm begins to expel from itself (physically and psychically) what it decides is not part of its own clean and proper self. This is the way the child begins to develop a sense of a discrete “I,” rather than remaining part of an undifferentiated semiotic chora. Abjection begins in early childhood and it continues throughout one’s life. What is abject is never…

‘subject’ and ‘object’ push each other away, confront each other, collapse, and start again – inseparable, contaminated, condemned, at the boundary of what is assimilable, thinkable: abject. (p. 18) This, I would argue, is also the central ideological project of the popular horror film – puriﬁcation of the abject through a ‘descent into the foundations of the symbolic construct’. In this way, the horror ﬁlm brings about a confrontation with the abject (the corpse, bodily wastes, the monstrous-feminine) in order, ﬁnally, to eject the abject and re-draw the bound- aries between the human and non-human. As a form of modern deﬁlement rite, the horror ﬁlm works to separate out the symbolic order from all that threatens its stability, particularly the mother and all that her universe signiﬁes. In Kristeva’s terms, this means separating out the maternal authority from paternal law. As mentioned earlier, the central problem with Kristeva’s theory is that it can be read in

key theorists render their object in these same elusive ways. When Julia Kristeva, in her essay Powers of Horror (1982), explains her concept of “abjection” (one of the central terms in horror’s critical lexicon), she admits that “the twisted braid of affects and thoughts” that abjection elicits does not actually have, “properly speaking, a deﬁnable object” – it is, she says, “a ‘something’ that I do not recognize as a thing” (1–2). To put it in the aphoristic words of Gertrude Stein: There is no there there. And this is what Eugene Thacker, in In the Dust of This Planet (2011), seizes on in his account of horror and our “unthinkable” world: that horror is “a privileged site in which [the] paradoxical thought of the unthinkable takes place” (2). As critics of horror – or just as readers and watchers – we might not be able to escape the notion that part of horror’s fundamental effect is the simultan- eous invitation and refusal of our desire to interpret.

A Abject: the abject is a term ﬁrst used by French feminist Julia Kristeva in her 1980 book The Powers of Horror. Kristeva uses the term to indicate the visceral horror hu- mans experience when confronted by those aspects of themselves and life that force them to acknowledge their own materiality. The abject is the experience of the fear and revulsion of one’s own impurity and materiality. All bodily functions are abject, especially those associated with waste or decay. The corpse and the maternal body are used by Kristeva as primary examples of the abject. One’s confrontation with a corpse, especially of a person to whom one is close, forces one not just to confront one’s own death symbolically, but to experience and confront the horror of the possibility of one’s death. The mater- nal body represents expulsion, fruitfulness and generative power that are repulsive and threatening to the phallocen- tric order. Abject is an especially useful concept for fem-

or even to inter-uterine existence. Julia Kristeva, amongst others, has developed Freud's thesis of the 'hidden' body around the concept of 'abjection'. Kristeva's highly complex (and often obscure) musings concentrate on the fear of the 'archaic' mother and the nature of defilement (excremental and 'menstrual'), the mechanisms of symbolic rejection and the borderlines of taboo. Such abjection has religious and sacred undertones but its symbolism is still tied to evolutionist and biologist presuppositions. Such theories (in all their sophistication and complexity) are essentially narcissistic (that which brings horror is that which we love, i.e. ourselves!) and are opposed by notions that horror is the result of a confrontation with the absolutely unknown, something much closer to demonic and folk explanations. That many modern critics see only the possible erotic (and therefore psycho-sexual) elements in Dracula is a reduction which diminishes

In Powers of Horror, Julia Kristeva theorizes that we learn to react with horror to all that which is abject: “what disturbs identity, system, order; what does not respect borders, posi- tions, rules,” which includes excrement, blood, the corpse, the criminal—those very elements that punctuate the horror genre.11 In other words, what is abject is that which threatens the boundaries of the self. Although we develop a sense of horror in our early formative years to differentiate ourselves from our excretions, these primal feelings are later revivified in the sociopolitical landscape.

to account for the seemingly excessive affect which liminal entities can elicit. This is not to imply that twentieth-century theorists are in any way supra-historical authorities on the historically specific materials under consideration here. But they do provide useful and provocative lines of departure. Kristeva's Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection, for instance, describes a human subject who struggles both to engage with, and disengage itself from, the inescapable fact of its own materiality. Within the Kristevan scenario this sometimes anguished ambivalence about the prospect of human embodiedness is set forth as universal, the inevitable product of infantile experience. But one may historicize the Essay on Abjection itself by placing it on a continuum with other anguished responses to the particular brand of materialism that arose in the nineteenth century. Or to put it in somewhat different terms, Kristeva's

saliva, sweat, tears and putrefying flesh. In terms of Kristeva’s notion of the border, when we say such-​and-​such a horror film ‘made me sick’ or ‘scared the shit out of me’, we are actually foregrounding that specific horror film as a ‘work of abjection’ or ‘abjection at work’ –​ almost in a literal sense. Viewing the horror film signifies a desire not only for perverse pleasure (confronting sickening, horrific images/​being filled with terror/​desire for the undifferentiated) but also a desire, once having been filled with perversity, taken pleasure in perversity, to throw up, throw out, eject the abject (from the safety of the spectator’s seat).

ment—Brian De Palma’s Carrie (1976), for example—her chief concerns are male fear of the womb and the negative, death-dealing cinematic image of the archaic mother. Creed also uses Julia Kristeva’s theory of abjection in Powers of Horror as a powerful tool in her analysis of the monstrous-feminine of hor- ror film. As Kristeva argued, abjection is related to the mother’s body; Creed argues that horror films construct the maternal figure as abject. As Creed puts it, “Kristeva argues that all individuals experience abjection at the time of their earliest attempts to break away from the mother. She sees the mother-child relation as one marked by conflict: the child struggles to break free but the mother is reluctant to release it.” Given the prohibitions placed on the mother’s body, chiefly the incest taboo, “the maternal body becomes a site of conflicting desires.” The mother bec…

of representation to operate. Brought to the brink of psychosis by this boundary troubling, Kristeva (1982, p. 4) describes the subject as falling in faint. This physical response causes the subject, in turn, to become a kind of cadaver (from cadere, to fall), a kind of living-dead. In The Monstrous-Feminine, Creed examines the corpse as abject abomination as it features in films such as The Evil Dead (Dir. Sam Raimi, USA, 1981) and Zombie Flesh Eaters (Dir. Lucio Fulci, Italy, 1979). For her the visceral reaction to abject materials in horror film registers abjection at work ‘almost in a literal sense’ (Creed 1993, p. 10). This seeming literalness, what Kristeva (2010, p. 178) refers to in relation to affect as the ‘degree zero of symbolism’, forms a symptom of the collapsing of signification that characterises audience responses to horror films at cer- tain moments, a psychic regression. During such moments, difference,

Eventually, she gains complete control of their bodies and actions and often forces them to propagate the cycle of violence originally performed on her corporeal self. This form of physical violence is a major source of horror in Tomie as almost all stories feature the deformed human body in all its gruesomeness. This char- acteristic portrayal of the human body and the response it evinces from the readers borders on the abject as theorised by Julia Kristeva in the Powers of Horror. For Kristeva, the abject is something that evokes feelings of sheer dis- gust, fear or repulsion fr…

strange “Célinian universe” Kristeva seeks to map. Unsentimentally non-metaphorical, the phrase “tangled meat” reports the grisly transi- tion, in death, from human subject to something horrifyingly other in tones that perfectly illustrate Kristeva’s definition of abjection in the earlier chapters of Powers of Horror. This scene acts out chapter 1’s dis- turbing example of the abjection of confronting a corpse, which does not “represent” death to the one who confronts it, but rather “show[s] me what I permanently thrust aside in order to live” (Powers of Horror, p. 3; emphasis Kristeva’s). Ferdinand’s discursive cutting loose, from sympathy to detachment, marks a common pattern throughout the novel, both in his actions and in his narrative style. It is easily readable as the very reaction to the abject that Kristeva describes. In response to this confrontation with horror up close, Ferdi…

pronounced withdrawal from direct political involvement to her disillusionment with aspects of Chinese society. Similarly, despite the cen- trality of her work to feminist theory, she has expressed ambivalence toward feminism as a social and political movement, though repeat- edly emphasizing the importance of addressing women’s psychic and social condition. The consolidation of Kristeva’s theoret- ical concerns with “the individual life” may be linked to her increased professional and intellectual engagement with psychoanalysis. During the mid 1970s she trained as an ana- lyst, starting her own psychoanalytic practice in 1979. Since 1980, her theoretical work has demonstrated a very close engagement with psychoanalytic theory, and art and literature are used extensively to explore psychoanalytic concepts and psychic processes. In Powers of Horror (1982), she analyzes the concept of “abjection” and “horror,” incorporating in these terms her earlier focus on “negativity” and

politics of the psyche. The Abject Abjection is perhaps the most rudimentary form of hatred and its uncon- scious phantom; it is clearly the concept that comes closest to depicting prohibited desire. Julia Kristeva is the scholar most closely associated with the noun “abjection” and the adjective “abject.” In The Power of Horror, she connects the power of abjection (the horror of desire) to literature, mother- hood, and fascism.25 Kristeva sees abjection as that uncanny force which shapes the social (religious, po liti cal, or sexual) order, fractures and wounds systems of speech and relations, and threatens identities, when pushed under extreme conditions from the dark depths of the unconscious to the surface of language and politics. The strict boundaries between self and

perhaps thereby divulges a certain fascination with this body); however, the abject is nonetheless an object of revulsion, always a potential “horror.” The disintegrating body/subject theorized by abjection has less to do with desire for a desublimated realm of being than it has to do with the perception that such a realm is beyond the bounds of human sense, perception, and possibility. Powers of Horror is not about desire to return to the void of the pre-Oedipal womb, but about how subjectivity is established through the very repudiation of the vacuity that it represents. Jay renounces this “ideal” vacuity, yet his own rejection of abject representation itself constructs an ideal: that of the unrep- resentable other, defiant of our comprehensibility even as it is paradoxically conscripted as other. Kristeva recognizes both the necessary initiation of the subject into language and the tyranny of a symbolic order that denies the recalcitrant body of decay, death, and desire.

her identity under attack. She reacts violently to this knowledge, vomiting, expel- ling the disgust that threatens to overwhelm her and in so doing she asserts herself against them and in opposition to the symbolic order. Kristeva (1982, p. 3) writes: ‘During that course in which “I” become, I give birth to myself amid the violence of sobs, of vomit.’ Abjection can draw one back into the patriarchal symbolic system or lead to new ways of being and, most importantly, self-questioning and ‘the liberation of psychic life’ (Kristeva, 2002b. p. 101). When Halla ﬁnally arrives at the orphanage in the Ukraine and meets Nika, she and the girl form an immediate bond as they both work together on Nika’s drawings of trees and plants.

to that improper, unclean Other which disturbs the identity of the subject I. It ‘precedes and possesses’ the subject, as an ‘archaic’ thing which is expelled through what Kristeva calls ‘primal repression’ (Kristeva: 1982, 10, 12). When it returns, it threatens the subject with dissolution, blurring the boundaries which are conventionally and often ritualistically drawn between human and inhuman, clean and defiled. The result may provoke disgust, as well as fascination. Kristeva had turned mostly to Biblical texts and modern literature, Louis-Ferdinand Céline especially, for themes of abjection. But Creed turns to the contemporary popular horror film, which – think of The Exorcist (1973), for example – routinely stages this return as a spectacular event, often literally dissolving the subject’s identity in the process through mutilation, pollution, possession, body-melt, and so on. For Creed and Kristeva, women have a ‘special relationship’ to the abject

the fact that it neither defines a clear object of desire nor belongs to the sub- ject/the self. Kristeva emphasized that the threatening element of horror was its indefinable quality, the revelation of the insufficiency of human language, and “the limits of the human universe” (Kristeva 1982: 11). The abject “disturbs identity, system, order [. . .] The in-between, the ambiguous, the composite. The traitor, the liar, the criminal with a good conscience, the shameless rapist, the killer who claims he is a savior” (Kristeva 1982: 4). Kristeva enumerated ex- uded “urine, blood, sperm, excrement” (Kristeva 1982: 52) as examples of the abject which threaten one’s “own and clean self” by breaking human, cognitive categories – a component which will be discussed in cognitive terms in Chap- ter 1.2.3 – through a “collapse of the border between inside and outside” (Kris- teva 1982: 52).

Stephen King: Powers of Horror 139 But it is Kristeva's concept of 'abjection' which will be of greatest concern to us in our consideration of horror in Stephen King: indeed, the concept was first formulated in the book called Pouvoirs de l'horreur (Powers of Horror).! Here Kristeva reaches 'back' before the Oedipus complex and the constitution of the self as a subject defined by an object, the (m)other. She posits an earlier 'splitting- off' from the mother which takes place in early infancy: this splitting-off may be defined as the merest preliminary turning-away from the mother. The child is not yet a subject nor the mother an object, but the moment of abjection is that in which aspace first appears between the two, aspace created, necessarily, bya slight movement of rejection or withdrawal. The abject is described in this way by Kristeva: The abject is not an ob-ject in front of me that I name or imagine.

clearly rejects her theory. According to Irigaray, the fear and loathing we associate with abjection do not come from the memory of insufficient dif- ferentiation from the maternal body. Rather, they come from our failure to acknowledge our indebtedness to that body. “How are any other feel- ings possible,” she asks, “when we are asked to move back toward some- thing that has always been negated, denied, sacrificed for the construction of an exclusively male symbolic world?” (Sexes 17). For Irigaray, abjection is thus the effect of psychoanalysis’ dereliction of the mother and not its an- tidote. Terror arises because the abject mother is an unacknowledged sub- stitute for an origin that remains completely unknown and for which we have no language. Invoking Kristeva’s “power of horror” as a lie, a conve- nient burial ground, Irigaray writes: And where are we to find the imaginary and symbolic of life in the womb and

Stephen King: Powers 01 Horror 141 White is traumatic: this trauma releases her latent 'telekinetic' powers and results in the virtual destruction of the small town in Maine where she has lived all her life. After the disaster we are told that the town is 'waiting to die'. Why should such a trivial- seeming incident have such consequences? Any why should Carrie White be endowed by her creator with 'telekinetic' powers? To answer such questions we have only to turn to Kristeva' s develop- ing account of the abject in Powers 01 Horror. As we have seen, Kristeva associates images of was te with abjection. She suggests further than this waste falls into two categories: the excremental, which threatens identity from the outside, and the menstrual, which threatens from within. Menstrual waste is for obvious reasons also connected particularly closely with the body of the mother and with 'memories' of the primary abjection of that body.

discussion of Céline demonstrates throughout, she presents herself as a literary analyst of just this kind, rhetorically attuned to “hear” the discourse it examines and to “listen” to its own. This imperative, implicitly, urgently extends to Kristeva’s readers as well. Powers of Horror approaches “Célinian scription” on the terms Kristeva lyrically outlines: as a writing that does not merely report but actually produces the abjection it so relentlessly explores, a writing that disrupts normative structures of signification and thereby demands non-normative strategies for analyzing it. On the premise of this thesis, she will examine the key features she highlights in this passage – his use of ellipsis, of materially graphic description, his insistence on linking extreme emotion with syntactical deformation, his gutter- mouthed colloquialism – in exquisite detail.

KRISTEVA, FEMININITY, ABJECTION modern horror text are grounded in ancient religious and historical notions of abjection - particularly in relation to the following religious 'abomina- tions': sexual immorality and perversion; corporeal alteration, decay and death; human sacrifice; murder; the corpse; bodily wastes; the feminine body and incest. These forms of abjection are also central to the construc- tion of the monstrous in the modern horror film. The place of the abject is 'the place where meaning collapses', the place where 'I' am not. The abject threatens life; it must be 'radically excluded' (Kristeva, 1982, 2) from the place of the living subject, propelled away from the body and deposited on the other side of an imaginary border which separates the self from that which threatens the self. Although the subject must exclude the abject, the abject must, nevertheless, be …

are meant to offer a means of more safely engaging with that which is considered to be abject. If, as Kristeva suggests, the abject collapses conventional delinea- tions, therefore threatening the contained self, it seems logical that Houdini might envisage regaining “control” of his experiences in Egypt by placing them in an established Western fictional model. In Powers of Horror, Kristeva proposes that the process of writing is integral to purging what is thought of as abject: “Writing then implies an abil- ity to imagine the abject, that is, to see oneself in its place and to thrust it aside only by means of the displacements of verbal play” (16). The writer is able to externalize what he or she considers abject by creating objects of repulsion in the text that can then be dealt with in a more considered and effectual manner. This use of literature as a means of catharsi…

Feminist New Wave Cinema is shaped by what Kristeva (1982) in her study of abjection, describes as ‘powers of horror’—a disturbance of identity, violence, meaninglessness, and a collapse of boundaries with the possibility of revolt and rebirth. These are the experiences and emotions which the female protagonist encounters on her journey into the dark night of abjection where she must face her worst nightmares – the rapist, murderous father, violent patriarchy, impersonal and cruel bureaucracies, heterosexist legal systems, and racist and sexist authorities. Her revolt may take the form of personal justice (Promising Young Woman, Emerald Fennell, 2020), revenge (Revenge, Coralie Fargeat, 2017; The Nightingale, Jennifer Kent, 2018), a terrorist attack (The Handmaid’s…

Introduction Since Freud and partly in line with his kind of psychoanalysis, the French theorist and therapist Julia Kristeva has gone on more recently in her book Powers of Horror (1980) to see the return of the repressed familiar in “the uncanny” as based on a more fundamental human impulse that also helps us to deﬁne the cultural, as well as psychological, impulses most basic to the Gothic. Kristeva argues for ghosts or grotesques, so explicitly created to embody contradictions, as instances of what she calls the “abject” and prod- ucts of “abjection,” which she derives from the literal meanings of ab-ject: “throwing off” and “being thrown under.” What we “throw off,” she sug- gests, is all that is “in-between . . . ambiguous . . . composite” in our beings, the fundamental inconsistencies that prevent us from declaring a coherent and independent identity to ourselves and others (p. 4)…

tional rape-revenge ﬁlms, these ﬁlms explore the nature of male monstrosity. What makes man monstrous? How is his monstrosity related to abjection? Kristeva deﬁnes abjection as: what disturbs identity, system, order. What does not respect borders, positions, rules. The in-between, the ambiguous, the composite. The traitor, the liar, the criminal with a good conscience, the shameless rapist, the killer who claims he is a savior. (Kristeva, 1982, p. 4) Kristeva speciﬁcally singles out the ‘shameless rapist’ as monstrous and abject. His crime is about power in that it potentially destroys the victim’s sense of self, her identity. In terms of asserting male power over women, rape is an act of colonisa- tion. It is designed to keep women in their place and is enacted in such a way that the woman ﬁnds it extremely diﬃcult to seek justice. Insofar as the abject erodes a sense of self, rape beco…

theme is developed in Totem and Taboo, where Freud traces the birth of civilization to the moment when primitive men rise up against the dominant male of their group, kill him and eat him. By forging bonds of guilt, remembrance and repentance, this primal act of revolt transforms a world that happens to be male-dominated into a society that is properly patriarchal.23 If this ‘totemic fable’, as Kristeva characterizes it, figures murder as the inaugural gesture of civilization, elsewhere in her writings crime is represented as an altogether more corrosive force. In Powers of Horror, for example, Kristeva declares that ‘Any crime, because it draws attention to the fragility of the law, is abject’.24 The ‘abject’, for Kristeva, is made up of those vilely fascinating objects of disgust and fear that populate the hinterlands of the psyche. It repre- sents material that is emphatically banishe…

permit itself to be read.” It’s a teasing assertion of inscrutability that runs throughout American horror, from the inexplicable gathering out in the woods in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s “Young Goodman Brown” (1835) to the enigmatic village ritual at the heart of Shirley Jackson’s “The Lottery” (1948) to the confounding architecture of the Overlook Hotel in Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining (1980). We see everywhere in horror a sustained confrontation with events, experiences, and forms of affect that just cannot be rationalized, cannot be explicated other than purely as what they are – pain, suffering, violence, fear; the stuff not of objective detachment and contemplation but of raw and immediate experience. If this is what horror gives us, then it’s perhaps no surprise that some of its key theorists render their object in these same elusive ways.

comprehensive detail; watch any gore film and be prepared to see an incredible, near infinite number of nauseating bodily discharges stream from broken flesh as the living body is transformed into a corpse. Whatever distance we seek to put between ourselves and the dead, we can be sure the horror film is more than up to the task of bringing it all back home. Unlike the positive critics who see horror as a generally beneficial enterprise, Kristeva (1980/1982) underlines the negation at work in disturbing texts. She argues that the abject signifies the terrible lack that marks us as empty or, even worse, filled with decay. The violence of the horror film is then the attempt to return to a zero state. Get rid of the bodies, the civilizations, the knowledge systems, and any other worthless fraud that masks the true emptiness that characterizes the most basic human state. We are …

Kristeva unveils as the problematic nature of the relationship between sub- ject and object: the power of horror, she states, derives from a form of ab- jection that “disturbs identity, system, order. What does not respect bor- ders, positions, rules. The in between, the ambiguous, the composite” (4). For Kristeva, the abject is the gothic identity that highlights the permeabil- ity of borders and that permits the passage from one category to another. From this perspective, William sees Ellen’s passing as an anxious crossing of physical and conceptual borders: a physical movement from South to North (or from bondage to freedom) that threatens her life, as well as a con- ceptual movement from one identity to another (blackness to whiteness, woman to man, etc.) that threatens her stable sense of self. William views these passages as upsetting the binarisms that constitute the grounds of di…

discovery of lost heroism and authenticity, and re-imposition of order’. Women writing Gothic horror problematise what is considered nor- mal, such as domestic settings, and enact what troubles us. Examples include the revelation of hidden family histories, the haunting of the past in the present in the fabric of the home, and inherited illnesses. Julia Kristeva’s notions of abjection in The Powers of Horror (1982) enable a theorised critique of conventional representations of women in horror, besides other literary and artistic or media work, and offer a perspective clarifying how much feminist Gothic horror challenges and moves beyond such conventions, constraints, misrepresentations and even demonising. Kristeva identifi es abjection as a stage in an infant’s development when it rejects that which is not-self in order to begin to recognise and defi ne the limits of self as opposed to Other. What is rejected includes faeces for,

or as an outmoded offshoot of Enlightenment philosophies of class conflict (i.e., old materialisms). Indeed, the two most influential twentieth-­century theorists of abjection, whose works map tidily onto ­those debased fields, are undoubtedly Julia Kristeva and Georges Bataille. Kristeva has generatively defined the abject in Powers of Horror (1982) as “that which is cast out.” This abominable ­matter further comes to symbolize all the reviled forms of differ- ence by which meaning and identity are delineated in language and culture. Kristeva writes: “­There looms, within abjection, one of ­those violent, dark revolts of being, directed against a threat that seems to emanate from an ex- orbitant outside or inside, ejected beyond the scope of the pos­si­ble, the toler- able, the thinkable. It lies ­there, quite close, but it cannot be assimilated.”1 In Kristeva’s psychoanalytic approach to abjection and selfhood, the child,

Fleete’s comment, the hellish night closes with an unexpectedly mild chastisement. Both screams and laughter are physiological responses resulting from a largely unconscious, reactionary assessment of a situation. In light of the visceral similarity, it is little surprise that the first laughter in horror appears in the work of a scholar intent on the interactions of physical and psychological experience. In Powers of Horror, Julia Kristeva refers to laughter as a means of “placing or displacing abjection”.5 To laugh severs the abject’s tie to the self and thus establishes and maintains identity boundaries. True to her visceral style, the physiological explanations and psychological combine: the body’s convulsion becomes the emotional equivalent of vomiting. The title declares the abject in the story, but readers may not realise they will find it conflated within the f…

to introducing language, which, just as it distinguishes pleasure from pain as it does all other oppositions, founds the separation inside/outside” (61). Although Kristeva continually stresses the material origins of abjects, she invariably thinks these origins nachtraeglich [retrospective] from the position of the subject and of language as the retrospective thresholds from which abjects are theorized and negotiated. Like any psychoanalytically informed theory of the confrontation with abjects, her theory is organized around the symbolic logic of regression|repression, which means that abjects are always already contained fully within the realm of representation|differentiation precisely because they are always already the result of the threat to break it up. In fact, abjection, as a “primal sublimation”, is the very strategy to deal with that threat. Somewhat…

of many Gothic texts. For Freud, the double suggests that the self is haunted by repressed feelings which threaten to disrupt common- place notions of everyday reality. Julia Kristeva’s Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection () moved away from the Freudian idea of doubling to argue that a culture needs to represent as abject any experiences which compromise the ‘norm’.5 Such a view has obvious applications to the Gothic conception of ‘evil’ and suggests that it is a necessary concept that ensures the well-being of the ‘norm’. Psychoanalytical readings can also be used in conjunction with more historicist approaches to the Gothic as it enables us to decode the form’s symbolism and discuss the critically retrieved narratives (or latent content) in historical terms. However, it is important to note that whilst early readings of the Gothic from the s frequently relied on predominately psychoanalytical   

Kristeva would call “a massive and sudden emergence of uncanni- ness, which, familiar as it might have been in an opaque and for- gotten life, now harries me as radically separate, loathsome. Not me. Not that. But not nothing, either” (Powers of Horror 2). It is clear from Kristeva’s remarks that a return of the other has a pro- found emotional import. In Stephen King’s Pet Sematary, the return of the dead from the grave might be seen to materialize the affect implicit in both Blanchot’s and Kristeva’s remarks, since the horror they evoke appears predicated not only upon our apprehension of what Blanchot would call “beings deprived of being” (39) but also because, as corpses, they return us to “what [we] permanently thrust aside in order to live” (Kristeva, Powers of Horror 3).

tions of what he refers to as “the twin gods of globalization and modernity,” arguing that horror can be used as means of resistance that is capable of expos- ing not the “powers of horror” (to allude to Kristeva’s famous work) but actu- ally the “horror caused by power.” What emerges from this section as a whole is the sense in which horror exposes something crucial to culture and society, and if it does indeed touch a nerve, then this should not be seen as an act of violence in itself, but as a means of indicating the wounding that has already taken place. Themes of Literary Horror As mentioned previously, it would be foolish to attempt an exhaustive list of the themes present in horror literature, but those that recur frequently can tell us much about the concerns of a culture at a given moment, the ways in which we conceive the self, and the ways in which we relate to the world beyond human INTRODUCTION

psychoanalysis itself might be brought into the picture, via the notion of abjection. This is the effect of focusing on Freud's more 'anthropological' writings and thence on religious practices in general. Secondly, however, as several writers have noted,18 Powers of Horror introduces a marked 'lightening' of style with a more liberal use of the first person and the more frequent inclusion of personal experience as illustrative of points being made. In this respect, we find Kristeva tacitly acknowledging her debt to Roland Barthes. Moreover, whereas prior to 1980, semiotics and psycho- analysis were brought to bear on works of art (cf. poetic language), now the tendency is to invoke works of art in order to illuminate, or even explain, concepts such as abjection. Céline's work is, for instance, used in this way. A similar stylistic approach appears in two other works of the …

but to somehow remain white. The black body imprisons the black soul, and the white consciousness that inhabits it assumes the mantle of warden and beneficiary. As with abjection itself, Chris’s look when he is compelled ­toward the “sunken place” appears neither comic nor horrific. His eyes glisten with tears, and in them we can see a reflection of something, perhaps ourselves. His face pre­sents itself to the camera, to the audience, for the experience of the jouissance about which Kristeva writes—­not merely joy nor horror nor any singular, nameable emotion, but a raw experience of the terrible pos- sibility of (not) being. Yet while Kristeva in her own racial formation would only imagine the audience for Get Out as white, Bataille might well see, in his notion of social abjection, the bottomless dread of that unrelenting structure of white supremacy and racial vio­lence by other means.

need to recognise the benefit which can accrue from being seen as ‘the protector’. For Tomas, this benefit is blown wide open and his weaknesses become an undeniably abject presence in the film’s narrative. I use this term in respect to Kristeva’s (1982) use of abject to describe psychologically that which we cannot stand, and I want to play with this in relation to the discussion about the Jungian presence of contra-­sexual energies in narratives presented in film. Her writings deploy this term to situate something which in Jungian terms is somehow beyond shadow – in other words it is beyond being capable of integration in the psyche because it is so thoroughly unacceptable; the only option is to reject it and banish it from conscious awareness. My interest here is in whether there are (in a generalised manner) ways in which women and men might deal with the abject, or the i…

now have an important role to play in policing and processing contem- porary encounters with the abject. Her preferred example for unpack- ing how artistic forms can fulfil the role of religion in modern society, providing controlled encounters with the abject or impure, is the nov- elist ­Louis-Ferdinand Céline, whose writings she analyses at length in ­Powers of Horror.6 In an interview with Charles Penwarden, ‘Of Word and Flesh’, which discusses Kristeva’s (1995) responses to the 1995 Tate Gallery exhibition Rites of Passage, she also views contemporary art as offering catharsis in the face of the abject. Kristeva describes ‘ob- jects that purify abjection in the work of certain artists’ (Kristeva 1995, p. 24). For Kristeva, works by artists such as Louise Bourgeois, Mona Hatoum, and Jana Sterbak embody a language that ‘attempts to come as close as possible, almost to accompany [the] state of abjection, [the]

Bodily Horror and Abjection The uncanny irruptions of the semiotic in conflict with the symbolic law can also be recognized in the language of bodily prohibitions or taboos. In the Powers of Horror (1980), Kristeva applies sémanalyse - her blend of semiotics and analysis - to the Biblical themes of defilement, abomination and sin. She also focuses on the French writer Louis- Ferdinand Céline (1894-1961), a virulent anti-Semite, pro-Nazi and wartime collaborator. Céline writes in rhythmic slang which aims to break all taboos by extreme scandalous abjection. He confesses to a relationship with his mother, a lace-maker, that has made him an unmasculine expert in every variety of lace.

The notion of abjection provides Kristeva with a tool for diagnosing a number of puzzling emotional responses, but she does so through appealing to their physical manifestations as much as to their pheno- menological character. This is not only because, like Freud, she sees them as expressions of drives that are opaque to their subjects, but also

sents material that is emphatically banished from sight, only to linger queasily in our peripheral vision. Abjection manifests itself in the spasms of nausea and disgust provoked by sewage or rotting food; but the ‘utmost of abjection’, according to Kristeva, is the corpse. ‘In that compelling, raw, insolent thing in the morgue’s full sunlight’, she writes, ‘I behold the breaking down of a world that has erased its borders’.25 These words might almost have been spoken by Delacour of the various abject lifeless bodies that she inspects – such as the bloated, slime-covered body of an unidentified woman in The Old Man and the Wolves, or the decapitated corpse of the translator Gloria Harrison in Possessions. Though these texts obviously belong to the murder-mystery tradition of novel-as-autopsy, their emphasis on the ‘borderline anxieties’ associated with abjection makes things difficult for any detective who would patrol the boundaries between crime and legality,

84 Gothic Hauntings are abject.72 For Kristeva, the abject has to do mainly with the maternal body and the semiotic. The association between the abject, the feminine and the maternal appears clearly in The Monk, where the subterranean crypt of the convent concentrates all the desire and the horror liberated in the novel. The crypt is like the underskirt of the convent, a hidden private world, which looks like a womb with its dark corridors and recesses. It is there that magic, a preverbal form of subjective omnipotence, can be exer- cised, there that Ambrosio’s sexual fantasies must reach their climax, there that dead babies linger. It is the secret place that Lorenzo must penetrate in order to be educated into manhood. The catacombs are the exact equivalent of female genitals. In his essay on the uncanny, Freud writes: It often happens that male patients declare that they fee…

Why Do We Like To Be Scared? 3 Theoretician Julia Kristeva wrote on the phenomenon of disgust and horror in her essay on the abject – a concept that exists between the concept of an object and the concept of the subject. The abject is seen as ‘other’, as something that as members of society we reject. Kristeva likens this rejection to the repulsion we feel when confronted by body fluids such as blood or semen and waste products like urine and faeces – things that were once a part of us but are no longer. We are at once repelled by and attracted to these internal– external elements. It is a fascination with the corporeal, which we will explore in greater detail in Chapter 3 (Werewolves and body horror). At its simplest, the abject is the scab on your knee which, as a child, you were repulsed by, but could not resist picking. In mainstream entertainment, there has been a grow…

as a form of ego-narcissism (Levinas), or the repression of the feminine (Iri- garay). Kristeva’s attention to the weakness of discourses of love, loss, and sepa- rateness in late modern societies does not only grasp the formation, deformation, and transformation of the structure of being with others. It also raises the question of what is lost, what loss is, and what mourning might be in these societies. Part 2 of the book turns to Kristeva’s thought on religion and art. First, chapter 5 shows that Powers of Horror provides a minor history of how religions took on the task, neglected by modern institutions and discourses, of elaborat- ing the limits of the ties between individual and society. That is to say, the his- torical religions provide symbolizations of the instabilities and capacities which make up the less visible features of the structure of being with others. These are the instabilities and capacities that turn on a presymbolic—“non-signifying”—

contributory part which, as a member of his army, he himself played in their slaughter. After experiencing a series of bloody battles, he suffers fantasies of the mutilated corpses returning to the land of the living in quest of retribution. He describes himself grotesquely as ‘covered in dead men’ and comments hysterically on ‘the madness of arms and legs that pushed in at my ears and mouth’ (p. 25). The spectral corpses that invade Henri’s fantasies, as well as being a device to impress the horror of war upon the reader, give us an insight into his psyche; they evoke both his feelings of guilt at participating in the bloodshed and his fear of death. They also serve to relate him to the abject. Kristeva describes the corpse as ‘the utmost of abjection’.45 She points out that it lacks a soul and is, in biblical terms, a signifier of pollution. Existing at the edge of life, it …

Aesthetic surgery is a serious business—involving risk, pain, cutting, family concerns, the desire for self-improvement—calculated to meet the demand that social subjects care for and control the body, that they not deny themselves beauty, or passively give up control of their psychophysical selves. Persons who appear on the show surely experience this range of considerations and exigencies, and to some extent confirm reputable psychological and soci- ological work on body image as central to self-image, self-understanding, and social success. As we have seen, “abjection” refers to the casting off of the unwanted other; in bodily terms, this is made up of the waste and fluids that suggest death, disorder, and the lack of clear boundaries. Kristeva is interested also, though not extensively, in abjection as a social phenomenon: how the woman and the racial other, for instance, come to be abjected in culture. The analogy

of the body, a descent into embodiment, the underworld of chthonian nature, followed by an ascent to textuality. The corpse "seen without God and outside science," Julia Kristeva explains, "is the height of abjection. ... It is something rejected from which one is not separated" ("Approach- ing" 127). His act of viewing the body marks Gordon's reclaiming of the "powers" of horror: For a moment it seemed all right, a more natural deathscene than any ever constructed for a viewing-room audience by a mortician. Then you saw the bruise . . . and the way the corpse was beginning to bloat. . . . You remembered that gassy smell. . . like farts in a closed room. He was a boy our age, he was dead, and I rejected the idea that anything about it could be natural; I pushed it away with horror. ("The Body" 417) In his revulsion, Gordie pronounces the scene unnatural, detaches himself from the body, and enters the symbolic order of culture and

a cure, a return to the act of imagination, fantasy, and representation, though, for some it can also be a pharmakon delivering us to our self-destructive drives and to an illusion of clarity and revelation. But for the most part, academic critics see a certain antidote in Kristeva’s writing. They see Kristeva’s novels as a mode of treatment for an individual (and for a collectivity) that suffers from a psychosocial melancholy, which stems in part from a depressive economy at the foundation of subjectivity (itself imbued with what Freud called the death instinct), but also in part from the pulverizing catastrophes of the twentieth century (e.g., Hiroshima, Auschwitz, the Gulag, and 9/11). Following Kristevan psychoanalysis, most of these critics believe that these traumatic and catastrophic experiences have carbonized the imaginary. That is, they have shut down our ability to …

symbolic circulates, but without inscribing her voice within it. The lack of productivity typical of hysterical silence contrasts sharply with Kristeva’s notion of abjection. If we recall Kristeva’s discussion of the texts of Céline and others, in chapter three, we can see that the subject of abjection remains, as Kristeva herself puts it, “eminently productive of culture.”118 The abject subject rejects and reconstitutes himself through his textual practice in language. Kristeva is quite clear, the hysteric does not symbolise her pain: “the hysteric spasm will never find a proper symbolic, will at best be enacted as a moment inherent in the rejection in the processes of the ruptures, of the rhythmic

hood. The spectacle is life as a dream – we all want this” (1995: 8). With Debord, Kristeva points to the way the society of the spectacle inverts reality – instead of experiencing the shallowness and meaning- lessness of capitalist society, subjects begin to experience images as real. While Debord focuses on the way this phenomenon alters objective reality, Kristeva focuses on how it distorts subjective space. In her book, New Maladies of the Soul, which she had written in 1993, Kristeva observes that a new kind of patient is appearing on psycho- analysts’ couches. Today’s patients seem to suffer from a withering of psychic space; they seem to have less of a “soul”: Modern man is a narcissist – a narcissist who may suffer, but who feels no remorse. He manifests his suffering in his body and he is afﬂicted with somatic symptoms. His problems serve to justify his refuge in the very proble…

and slashed across the throat. The severed skin slowly splits, as Annie takes her last gulp of air, disgorging life in a spectacular shot that nicely captures Annie's stricken throat vomiting forth a wave of crimson gore. Victim 2—Ned. Ned's ashen corpse is disclosed in a slow upward tilt away from a pair of distracted lovers. In a move that showcases just how close death is to unknowing protagonists, we are privy to a mutually satisfying carnal embrace between two future victims immediately prior to the shot of Ned's gaping throat. He has been left displayed atop a soiled mattress on a cheap bunk bed above the engrossed lovers. When the camera ceases to rise, we are granted a medium close-up of Ned's broken larynx. The camera stays fixed until we could furnish an anatomi- cally correct description of Jason's meticulous handiwork. Victim 3—Jack. Jack lies in the bottom bed, un…

pleasure, while she herself has the least. That makes her suffer. The little fat one knows the value of pleasure. Being someone who knows, who feels the riches from which she is barred, she belongs to the race of the damned; she is in hell. That is what is being guessed on the other side. The tall thin girl guesses this need of the other, which consists in exhausting hell, in going so far in sadism and nas- tiness that she would have a chance to exhaust what is figured under the name of venom. One has to say that at that moment, little Clarice has an incredible ca- pacity for compassion. She is no fool. But she does not attribute it to anything but hell, the hellish need of the other. So she does not defend herself. She says: "Even while guessing, sometimes I accept." Her hypothesis is that she can offer it to herself. That is what the little fat girl also thinks: she can pay the other b…

significations, but rhythmic, melodic articulations” (2002a, 258–59). 2. Powers of Horror has been interpreted as part of a trilogy of works that together represent Kristeva’s turn toward psychoanalysis; these include Tales of Love and Black Sun. 3. In Intimate Revolt, Kristeva defines the abject as a notion she develops from her clinical experience and as a symptom of a psychical economy where the separation between the subject and the object is not clear: “which also refers to the archaic rela- tionship of nonseparation with the maternal container: the mother being the primary abject” (2002a, 260). 4. Kristeva’s other books before the publication of The Samurai include On Chinese Women (1974), Language: The Unknown (1981), Tales of Love (1983), In the Beginning was Love: Psychoanalysis and Faith (1985), Black Sun (1987), and Strangers to Ourselves (1988). 5.

that she would be envious of his future lover, whom he said he would love more than he had loved her, adding that “I cannot imagine how you can possibly love her more than you love me now.”54 At around this time, Mako, who has seen Miko’s face following the operation, starts insisting on Miko having plastic surgery. Miko, on the other hand, begins to realize the discrepancy between their perspectives: “I felt strange because you used the past tense in your letters. I wondered if our relationship has become a thing of the past for you, wondered if you knew me only as an already dead woman. And if so, I should let you go, set you free.”55 Both of them, it appears, believe that plastic surgery to reconstruct Miko’s face would help her get out of the hospital. But it is becoming increasingly clear to physicians that Miko’s cancer is spreading beyond their control, and that there is not much point in reconstructing

CHAPTER 1 Abjection For Julia Kristeva, the intolerable, or abject, body leaks wastes and fluids, in violation of the desire and hope for the “clean and proper” body, thus making the boundaries and limitations of our selfhood ambiguous, and indicating our physical wasting and ultimate death. In her view, human and animal wastes such as feces, urine, vomit, tears, and saliva are repulsive because they test the notion of the self/other split upon which subjectivity depends. The skin of milk, for instance, puts one in mind of the thin skin membrane that defines the borders and the limits of the physical body; because human skin provides only a relatively flimsy and easily assaulted partition between the body’s inside and the world outside, this milky reminder disturbs our distinctions between outside and inside, I and other, moving us to retch, and want to vomit in an acute attempt to expel the scum from our being (Kristeva, Powers of Horror
